    "description": "Bit calculator. Convert 32 bits to decimal and hexadecimal values and vice versa. This application is unique in that it allows for easy access to each bit within the 32 bits, which are layed out across the screen. Great for students, electronics engineers and embedded software programmers. No need to make even the slightest mental effort to calculate bits anymore. Simply take out your mobile phone, launch ChordBits-Robot and relax!Turn the bits on and off and watch the value changes correspondingly in the decimal and hexadecimal views. Change the value in the decimal view or in the hexadecimal view and watch the bits change their states.Tapping inside the decimal or hexadecimal views pops up a dedicated keyboard that makes it even easier to enter values. It contains big buttons! Only figures required for decimal or hexadecimal numbers are included. You can use it with one thumb!The menu allows for common bits operations, like shift right/left, negate, two's complement. You can also view the decimal values as signed or unsigned.The application also allows for nice animation for the bits and the special keyboard via the menu - Fun settings!",
