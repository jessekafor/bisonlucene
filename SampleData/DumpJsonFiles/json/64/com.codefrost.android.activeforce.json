        "comment": "Excellent app! Excellent support! It imported my csv of over 300 quotes perfectly, (once I followed the guidelines and sample provided by the dev in the app description). The only feature requests I have is the ability to dynamically size the text with the size of the widget instead of a static font size...and user control of the margin size...  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!",
