        "comment": "The vendor\\'s website shows a lot of functionality in the iPhone version of the app, and gives the very misleading impression that the Android version has the same functionality - but this is a totally wrong impression!! The Android version is a very poor and restricted shadow of the iPhone version. Furthermore, the syncing with the PC application sucks; in my case there has been a fifty percent failure rate where either the Android app or the PC app crashed... Also I don\\'t like Bonjour running permanently.",

You cannot edit anything or add anything and the lack of updates for the price is shocking. And with a new desktop version on the horizon for another 20 quid, you can forget it.
