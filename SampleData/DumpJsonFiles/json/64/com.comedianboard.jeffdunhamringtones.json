    "description": "Jeff Dunham (born April 18, 1962) is an American ventriloquist and stand-up comedian who has also appeared on numerous television shows, including Late Show with David Letterman, Comedy Central Presents, The Tonight Show and Sonny With a Chance. He has five specials that run on Comedy Central: Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity, Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special, Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos and Jeff Dunham: Minding the Monsters. Dunham also starred in The Jeff Dunham Show, a series on the network in 2009.[1] His style has been described as \"a dressed-down, more digestible version of Don Rickles with multiple personality disorder\". Describing his characters, Time observes, \"All of them are politically incorrect, gratuitously insulting and ill tempered.\" Dunham has been credited with reviving ventriloquism,[4] and doing more to promote the art form than anyone since Edgar Bergen.This App is an excellent way to get new free ringtones, notifications or alarms!
