I installed this app and it did not worked at the beginning, showing the dotted screen on the TV and no password. I have two networks at home with several computers and devices connected to them. I checked the connections of both the TV and the phone and realized that they were connected to different networks. I adjusted that and it worked perfectly, both on the same network. Hope this to be helpful for you all",

        "comment": "Unfortunately this does not work with my 2012 LG 42LM620S but the original LG TV Remote does.  Another issue to watch out for is to make sure that you have a proper wireless network setup and your TV is connected to the network via WiFi and if your TV isn\\'t equipped, buy the LG WiFi dongle.  You can pick up one on Amazon or Ebay at a reasonable price.  The final connection option is via network cable  if you have wired capability.    So answer is if it doesn\\'t work, try all versions. I am going to state the obvious rule of thumb, no, RJ45 LAN socket (required to be connected to your wireless hub directly or by network), no WiFi, not compatible with the LG dongle and no USB it won\\'t work at all.",

I finally began entering bogus pairing numbers out of frustration when all of a sudden, the actual pairing number popped up on the bottom right hand corner of tv screen on my LG.  after entering the correct pairing number into the app, it synchs right up.   Honestly, after playing around, I find this app pretty useless for my needs.  I use ATT Uverse & a Bose Sound System.  The only time I would need this app is to switch from the BluRay back to ATT Uverse and vice versa.   Although this app really doesn\\'t fit my needs, I still give it 5 out of 5 stars because it works exactly how it says it works and does it well.",

        "comment": "Worked fine before now won\\'t even find my LG TV on the network.  Honestly do you guys even check these apps before you send out an update? If you would just provide a way to manually enter the TVs IP address then everything will be just fine.  I know it\\'s this poorly written app because everything else in my system that uses a remote app works perfectly.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  Update 8/8/2013 if I reset the TV it will connect but fails again when the TV is turned off/on.  EPIC FAIL!",
