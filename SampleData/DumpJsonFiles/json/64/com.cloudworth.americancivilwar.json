    "description": "Conflicts: American Civil War is a highly rated turn based strategy game which takes place on the Southwest North America during the American Civil War.You are in the command of the Confederate armies during the American Civil War. The object of the game is to conquer the Union or at least hold on to as much area as possible until the year 1866. To have a chance to seize the top spot in the Hall of Fame you need to skillfully encircle scores of Union units, while trying to deal with the meager Confederate resources.The game is over if:+ Either side controls all the cities, or+ The year 1866 begins.FEATURES:+ Two game modes:(1) NORMAL MODE: All the resources go to the resource pool automatically (quick & easy).(2) SUPPLY MODE: You manually transport ammo to attacking units, and gold to major cities (requires more planning).+ Competitive: Measure your skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defence performance, ability to cross rivers without losing move points.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: difficulty levels, what to draw on the map, custom font and map sizes.+ Inexpensive: An entire war for the price of a coffee!+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.To get a sense of how Conflicts: American Civil War works, try out Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa LITE -- http://goo.gl/vLuaP -- which uses the same mechanics as Conflicts: American Civil War.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in turning the tide of the American Civil War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine whether or not you are connected to the internet so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (visit settings to turn the feature OFF or alter its behaviour).",
