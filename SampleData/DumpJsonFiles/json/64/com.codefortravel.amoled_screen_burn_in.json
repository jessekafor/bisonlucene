A sequence of primary colors is used to restore burned-out pixels.  Built for ICS and Jelly Bean, the sequence will run fullscreen so that the Navigation Bar is hidden.Recommended for Galaxy Nexus and similar devices.",

TIP:  Turn your brightness as low as possible, before starting the app, leave it alone and plugged in for at least 8 hours.  This works just like the break-in of a plasma turning the brightness up or leaving it on auto will diminish the results.",
