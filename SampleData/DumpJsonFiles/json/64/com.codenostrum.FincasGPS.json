        "comment": "This app sucks !  It is a big land loser.  I activated my best GPS app before this survey app would even work. After allowing my phone to get accurate readings, I walked off my property, stopped and allowed the app to get accurate readings at every corner of my property. When finished, I asked the program to show my surveyed land.  None of the information was correct. It showed my property as being almost 2000 yards west of my real property.  I\\'ve removed this loser.",
