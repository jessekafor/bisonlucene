Get this free app now and refresh your phone!If you are a true lover of this beverage, you must have wondered âhow is Coke made?â The composition and bottling process is a complex and interesting procedure. It takes a lot to make every single bottle of Coke taste the same. First off, the bottles are taken to the cleaning unit. Here, they get cleaned, steamed and sanitized to rid them of any dirt and debris. This is done by jet streams and water. Then, they are picked up by something that looks like an overhead conveyer belt. It's not a traditional conveyer belt, though. Individual clamps pick up a bottle, and they are transported from station to station above the room. It is time for the Coke to be put into the bottles.The soda is not all put in at the same time. The mixing process actually has more steps now than it did when it was first bottled. Before, the syrup would go in first, and the carbonated water would go on top. Now, in a room full of bags of sugar and buckets of caramel coloring, Coke is bottled using four different steps. First, pure water is put in the bottle by a machine, after that, refined sugar is added to the mix.Then, the sugar water gets the Coke's secret formula mixture and some caramel coloring. Machines shake the bottles up a bit to make sure everything is mixed together well.After everything is mixed together, carbon dioxide is added to the mix to make the drink fizz. After all, who wants a flat bottle of this fizzy drink? The machines then sent the bottle down another conveyer. This is the point where drinks are checked by a controller for quality.âSoft drinksâ go way back to the 17th century, when people would travel to natural springs and drink the mineral water found there. Mineral water was believed to have healing powers, and visitors would even bathe in it. Some mineral waters were naturally carbonated, due to the dissolved gas carbon dioxide or carbonium. Drinking mineral waters had long been considered a healthy thing to do, so the pharmacists took advantage of their newly purchased apparatuses and used them to generate mass quantities of carbonated water.
