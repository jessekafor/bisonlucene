    "description": "The Pacific Heights Moms & Tots Club is the most exclusive childrenâs playgroup in all of San Francisco. For the cityâs ultra-competitive elite, the clubâs ten annual spots are the ultimate parenting prize.But not everyone is PHM&TC material. The clubâs founder, Bettina Connaught Cross, adheres to strict membership rules: Moms only. No single parents or working mothers allowed. Membership is an arduous commitment. And thereâs no room in the club for scandal, bad behavior, or imperfectionâ¦from tots or their moms.In a world of power and prestige, no one has more than Bettina. And as every mom in Pacific Heights knows, you simply cannot cross her. But this yearâs admissions process is more rigorous than ever, pitting prospective members against each other to prove their mettle.But four of the six candidates vying for the remaining four slots have a secret that would knock them out of the running. Jade is a former stripper and porn actress, who has been absent for most of her sonâs life. Jillianâs husband cleaned out their joint accounts and left her for his pregnant assistant. Ally never even had a husbandâjust a sperm donorâand sheâs hiding a high-ranking corporate job. And Lorna fears that her son may have special needsâ¦ just the excuse her sister-in-law, Bettina, needs to deny her entry to the club.Can these hopeful moms keep up appearances long enough to outlast the competition? Or will their chancesâand their private livesâgo up in flames?This is the first of four books that follow our heroines during âthe Onesies,â their inaugural year in the club. Upcoming booksâto be released in four episodes each yearâwill follow subsequent years: the Twosies, Threesies, Foursies, and Fivesies.Friendship. Lies. Seduction. Betrayal.
