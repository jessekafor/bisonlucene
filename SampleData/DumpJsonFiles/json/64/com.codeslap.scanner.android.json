    "description": "Police Scanner and RadioPolice Scanner and Radio is the best police scanner or police radio out there because it is FREE but gives you all of the same features and quality as the paid radio apps. Police Scanner and Radio lets you listen in on live emergency (firefighter and police), military (marine) and transportation (airplanes and railroads) conversations taking place over the radio waves. Scan what's being said so you can be the first to learn breaking news in your area. (Please note it is legal to listen to, but not interfere with, police feeds for entertainment purposes only.)Features:-\tListen to the police radio (similar to a police scanner)-\tChoose from one of the 3500 Police Scanner Radio options that come with this app-\tListen to police feeds in the background (you can use other apps or visit websites while you listen to the transmissions) -\tChoose from any police radios around you with our nearby feature (we even tell you how far you are away from the radio station)-\tChoose from the Top100 feeds-\tOr search the country, state, county or city to find the feed you would like to tune into-\tThe app also comes with a police code language dictionary so you know whatâs going on the police radio that you are listening toHow does a police radio scanner work? (answer from Wikipedia)A scanner is a radio receiver that can automatically tune, or scan, two or more discrete frequencies, stopping when it finds a signal on one of them and then continuing to scan other frequencies when the initial transmission ceases.We have put all of this in an app for you so it is easy to listen to the police radio, for everyone. Is it legal?In most countries, including the USA, it is legal to listen to the police radio or to use a police scanner. However, it is NOT legal to use this app to aid in a crime or interfere with police activity. Is the radio real?Yes, all of the police streams that you can listen to in the police scanner radio are real. They are played in real-time. What stations are supported?We support radios from all around the world including:All 50 US State Police RadiosCanadian Police RadioAustralian Police ScannerChilean Police Radio Italian Police RadioUK Police ScannerGerman Police RadioSwiss Police RadioDutch Police ScannerSwedish Police RadioVenezuelan Police ScannerNZ Police RadioBrazilian Police RadioSpanish Police ScannerBelgium Police RadioSlovenian Police ScannerTop 10 Police Scanners:1.\tChicago Police Radio Scanner2.\tLAPD â Los Angeles Police Department Police Radio3.\tWaterloo (Canada) Regional Police 4.\tNYPD â New York Police Department Special Operations Division Police Radio5.\tSan Diego Police Dispatch 6.\tIngham County Public Safety Radio7.\tPictou County Public Safety 8.\tSan Juan and Once Police, Fire and EMS Radio Station9.\tHouston Police Radio Scanner10.\tMetropolitan Regional Fire Department RadioSample of Police Codes:Code 2 Urgent - no light or sirenCode 3 Use lights and sirenCode 4 No further assistance neededCode 5 StakeoutCode 6 Stay out of areaCode 7 Meal breakCode 8 Restroom breakCode 9 Summer uniformCode 10 SWAT pre-call upCode 11 SWAT Call upCode 37 Subject/Property wanted Code Blue Bus/Cab in troubleCode Red Varda Alarm activatedCode Purple Gang Activity Medical / Fire Status Codes...Code 10 Critical Trauma caseCode 20 Acute Trauma caseCode 30 Trauma caseCode 40 Serious case (IV started)Code 50 Basic transport (not serious)Code N Newsworthy event 5150 Mental case10851 Auto theft10852 Tampering with vehicle20001 Hit and run - Felony20002 Hit and run - Misdemeanor20007 Hit and run - Unattended21958 Drunk pedestrian on roadway22350 Speeding22500 Illegal parking23101 Drunk driving - injuries23102 Drunk driving23103 Reckless driver23104 Reckless driver23105 Driver under narcotics23109 Racing23110 Person throwing objects atvehicles23151 Drunk driving - injuries23152 Drunk driver",
