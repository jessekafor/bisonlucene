    "description": "Radar bluetooth and WIFI detector and mapper.Use Radar app in any area and it will list you all bluetooth devices or WIFI spots within range. Ability to map your location and the detected device location and to save the information.Check for unknown devices within your area that could be attributed to nefarious activity, possible robbers, intruders or surveillance.Use the device as a counter surveillance device, especially against apps that search for you without your permission, people, etc. For instance there are several pervert apps on the market that search female users- you can use this app to identify all devices in an area and save them if you are contacted by the pervert, maybe you all like being interrupted in your daily life by perverts and this app is not for you, otherwise this counter app is the best investment you will make.Use in your business to keep track of trouble makers, or for surveillance.Unlimited possibilities for this app. Best features are the detection of all and any bluetooth device, headsets, tv's, car systems, android, iPhone, blackberry, symbian, any and all bluetooths can be detected, then those devices can be saved to a database, you can map the location of the devices and you can retrieve saved information to determine if the device has been previously discovered.Trial version allows a few free tries then allows you the option to buy the app for unlimited use.This app works via bluetooth, so no web access required, you control when you use the app and how to use the app, and this allows you to have a counter-surveillance tool for minimal dollars spent.If Pistorious had the app he would have scanned the apartment and found only previous common devices in the area and he would not have committed the accident. Like everyone else, all thieves have a cellphone with a bluetooth, so if you use our app regularily you can have a database of friendly devices then when you scan in a dangerous area any device not recognized has to be a threat.*******many man hours spent on this excellent app, so there is limited free use- please respect our programmers and our company, leaving negative comments because you feel entitled to free applications doesn't mean the app doesn't work because you have reached the limit of free use**************",
