In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe, except France, attracting foreign composers such as Handel. Today the most renowned figure of late 18th century opera is Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and CosÃ¬ fan tutte, as well as The Magic Flute, a landmark in the German tradition.The List of Operas is an application containing detailed information of 400+ Operas.

        "comment": "Like the name implies, it\\'s a list of operas by title.  Each entry has a brief background, synopsis, and lists some recordings (unrated). The search function is limited to titles; you can\\'t search by composer, character name or other term. It\\'s fun to browse through in spare moments and discover some less-well-known works and look at the portraits of the composers, but it\\'s not a substantial reference work.",
