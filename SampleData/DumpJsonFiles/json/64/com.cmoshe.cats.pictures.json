    "description": "All cat breeds in one hot image gallery. Brows for cute kittens photos. Over 800 HD images of cats.The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat to distinguish it from other felids and felines, is a small, usually furry, domesticated, carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship and for its ability to hunt vermin and household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years, and are currently the most popular pet in the world. Owing to their close association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere in the world.Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As nocturnal predators, cats use their acute hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey of cats (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat has evolved to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use a variety of vocalizations, pheromones and types of body language for communication. These include meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting.Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering and the abandonment of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, with a population of up to 60 million of these animals in the United States alone.Cats breeds pics in this photo-gallery:Abyssinian,    \tAegean cat,    \tAustralian Mist,    \tAmerican Polydactyl,    \tAmerican Bobtail,    \tAmerican Curl,    \tAmerican Longhair,    \tAmerican Shorthair,    \tAmerican Wirehair,    \tAsian (cat),    \tAsian Semi-longhair,    \tBalinese,    \tBambino (cat),    \tBengal,    \tBirman,    \tBombay,    \tBrazilian Shorthair,    \tBritish Shorthair,    \tBritish Longhair,    \tBurmese,    \tBurmilla,    \tCalifornia Spangled Cat,    \tChantilly / Tiffany,    \tChartreux,    \tChausie,    \tCheetoh,    \tColorpoint Shorthair,    \tCornish Rex,    \tCymric,    \tDevon Rex,    \tDomestic shorthair cat,    \tDonskoy or Don Sphynx,    \tDragon Li,    \tEgyptian Mau,    \tEuropean Shorthair,    \tExotic Shorthair,    \tGerman Rex,    \tHavana Brown,    \tHimalayan / Colorpoint Persian,    \tJapanese Bobtail,    \tJavanese,    \tKorat,    \tKurilian Bobtail,    \tLaPerm,    \tMaine Coon,    \tManx,    \tMinskin,    \tMunchkin,    \tNebelung,    \tNapolean (cat),    \tNorwegian Forest Cat,    \tOcicat,    \tOjos Azules,    \tOregon Rex,    \tOriental Bicolour,    \tOriental Shorthair,    \tOriental Longhair,    \tPersian,    \tPeterbald,    \tPixie-bob,    \tRagamuffin,    \tRagdoll,    \tRussian Blue,    \tRussian White, Black and Tabby,    \tSavannah,    \tScottish Fold,    \tSelkirk Rex,    \tSerengeti cat,    \tSiamese,    \tSiberian,    \tSingapura,    \tSnowshoe,    \tSokoke,    \tSomali,    \tSphynx,    \tThai / Old-style Siamese,    \tTonkinese,    \tToyger,    \tTurkish Angora,    \tTurkish Van / Vankedisi,    \tUkrainian Levkoy,    \tUssuri,    \tYork Chocolate Cat.Search Tags: cat pics, cat images, cute cats pictures, kittens photos, kitty, bengal cats, HD cats photos, wild cats. home cats, black and white cats, cats breeds, house cats, free cats.",
