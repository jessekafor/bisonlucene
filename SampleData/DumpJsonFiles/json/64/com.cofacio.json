    "description": "With the Help Engine app you can help other people out and support charitable causes at the same time, five minutes is all it takes. The Help Engine makes it simple for people help each other, share ideas and offer advice on a range of subjects such as cooking, charity actions, places to visit and things to buy. What's more, by using the help engine and being thanked users earn goodwill points which are then turned into funds for charity projects by our corporate partners. It's simple to use, you just search for help and we show you people who can help. Or alternatively, if you're feeling in a helpful mood you can search to give help on any subjects you know about and we'll show you people who could do with your help. Simply answer their question and we'll let them know someone has helped them so they can come back and thank you.",
