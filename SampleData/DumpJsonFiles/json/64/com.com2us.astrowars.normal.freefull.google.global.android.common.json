        "comment": "But I find the game freezing after combat often, might just be on Transformer Prime though. Edit: Game freeze happens after every second combat is resolved. Edit2: cannot toggle off sound and notifications.  imo game is imbalanced at higher level, gated research advancement and the ability to attack players several levels and tech lower makes the game less appealing at high 20\\'s.  Would consider this a 4 star app without bugs noted above.",

The display of win/loss encourages attacking those who are beaten already because combat losses out weigh loot in wins. Attack the undefend and get loot from insta surrender. Gameplay is similar to lots of games. Only thing unique is you design ships but this feels superficial due to limited slots & devices/weapons.
