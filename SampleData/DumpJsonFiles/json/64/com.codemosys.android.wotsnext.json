        "comment": "I must have tried 20 or so todo lists and task organisers and none of them did what I wanted. This app works brilliantly in virtually every aspect. I add tasks, put them into categories (if I want to), give them dates (via a touch calendar not putting in dates), and then the magic happens. I can view my week, month or day, and see all the tasks for that day/week etc. Even the widget (I  use the biggest one on a full screen) is perfect and I chose to keep completed tasks showing which gives me a great feeling of productivity. I have purchased the full app and am really, really happy with almost every aspect of it. A truly great app that feels solid and reliable. This is the 2nd most important app I have (second only to my email app) and I use it daily and constantly. (I was so annoyed at the other todo apps and calendar apps that I seriously considered writing my own. Now I have found this, no need, it does everything.)  PS The two selection boxes make it soooooo useful. One does todays tasks, this weeks, overdue etc and the other does categories. A simple but incredibly useful sorting feature!) Five stars easily - Thank you and for the \\302\\2432 it cost a real bargain!",
