    "description": "General Assembly is the annual meeting of our Unitarian Universalist Association. Attendees worship, witness, learn, connect, and make policy for the Association through democratic process. The 2013 General Assembly is in Louisville, Kentucky from June 19-23. The theme of this GA is \"From Promise to Commitment.\" Building on the experience of Justice GA, we will gather in Louisville to examine and renew our covenant to our faith, one another, our congregations and the larger world.Programs will explore the kinds of promises our religious communities are called to make as we seek to live out our Unitarian Universalist values; how we make these promises, with whom, and how we hold ourselves and each other accountable. Here are just some of the topics that will be addressed: environmental justice, the next steps in immigration justice, anti-racism, anti-oppression multiculturalism, organizing for justice, multigenerational work, growing Unitarian Universalism, leadership education, spiritual growth and theology. There will also be many, many opportunities to worship.",

        "comment": "My schedule still does not let you add your own appointments or export to a real calendar app.  I am not going to go back and forth between my own calendar and my schedule; too much opportunity for mishaps.  This is the same complaint I had last year.  Without this feature, the app is only good for looking up workshop rooms and times.  It is really no \\\"smarter\\\" than the print version. A missed opportunity",

One list. What is offered in session one? Go back to the main menu and look for a different list. What are the youth options at the same time? Go back to the main menu and look at a third list.
