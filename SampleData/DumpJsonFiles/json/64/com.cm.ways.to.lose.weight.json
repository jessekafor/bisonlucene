Some are very simple how to diet tips, others are a little more challenging, but worth the effort. Simple rules for fast fat loss that works. The main point in dieting is to consume less food than your body needs. When this happens, your metabolism reverts to using stored energy in body fats. It uses those fats as substitute fuel, and your stored fats would be trimmed down using this method to a more desirable level.According to the CDC, two-thirds of  adults and children in America have been classified as obese. If you are overweight or obese, then you should know that there are several easy ways to lose weight.For thousands of years obesity was rarely seen. It was not until the 20th century that it became common, so much so that in 1997 the World Health Organization (WHO) formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic. As of 2005 the WHO estimates that at least 400 million adults (9.8%) are obese, with higher rates among women than men. As of 2008, The World Health Organization claimed that 1.5 billion individuals over the age of 20 are considered obese. The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60 years old. Once, overweight and obesity, considered a problem only of high-income countries, obesity rates are rising worldwide. These increases have been felt most dramatically in urban settings. The only remaining region of the world where obesity is not common is sub-Saharan Africa.
