        "comment": "This is supposed to have a database of locations that it can check when you don\\'t have any internet.  Maybe the data is in there, but you can\\'t get it out, because it can\\'t find the ones where you currently are -- all it ever shows you is the last neighborhood where you did have a connection.  It checks your GPS but ignores the result!  Then, to add insult to injury, it shuts off your wifi receiver.  Recent updates have fixed none of these easily solved problems.",
