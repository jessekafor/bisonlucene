Show off your new best live wallpaper to everybody!âWhat are clouds?â A cloud is made of water drops or ice crystals floating in the sky. The sky can be full of water, but most of the time you can't see it. The drops of water are too small to see since they have turned into a gas called water vapor. As the water vapor goes higher in the sky, the air gets cooler, which causes the water droplets to start to stick to things like bits of dust, ice or sea salt. Some Native American tribes believed that the spirits they worshipped lived in the clouds of the sky. They even had explanations for the various types of clouds, rain, lightning, and thunder.When the spirits were pleased, it is said that the clouds would be few. Those that did show up would be fluffy white and often held positive messages for the people below living on earth. But only the most faithful were able to interpret and use the messages to their benefit.When there were no clouds in the sky, it was believed that the spirits were in council somewhere in the realm beyond mankind. During that time, the spirits talked about ways to guide their people. Sometimes, these council meetings resulted in new gifts for mankind. Other times, a less pleasant result would occur.When the clouds were thin and wispy, it supposedly meant that the spirits were not in the mood to expose themselves to their people on earth. Just like us, they may have, from time to time, become bored or disillusioned with life in general and with the foibles of mankind in particular.Gray puffs meant that the spirits were expressing their unhappiness or disappointment. Sometimes they threw lightning from the sky to destroy the things that mankind no longer appreciated or had taken for granted. The thunder represented their warrior cries of anger and frustration.Download â'Clouds Live Wallpaper'â and âbe on cloud nineâ each time you take a look at your new favorite wallpaper background!This live wallpaper has been tested on latest devices such as Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, HTC One X, Google Nexus 4, Sony Xperia Z.
