        "comment": "The app installed correctly for me without issue and provides some great information about the church. There are some UI  issues certainly (moving the slider to see the outside of the church in different centuries also causes the model to rotate so it\\'s impossible to view how the church changed from one direction). Overall, the app is nice and I\\'m appreciative for the additional information it provides free of charge.",
