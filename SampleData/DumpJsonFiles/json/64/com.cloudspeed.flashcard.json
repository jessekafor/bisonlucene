        "comment": "Thanks to Reviewers and description, very close to what I was looking for.  It cycles through chinese expressions first saying mandarin, then saying english.  Says each one 3 times.  So I can just turn it on and do other things while I slowly learn chinese.  Other apps require reading or touching screen.  I think saying english first would be better but since it says the expression 3 times, good enough.  Just remember at the end of the 3rd time, the english isn\\'t for the next chinese expression, a little confusing, english first would be much better.",

        "comment": "Good sound quality/clarity, good flashcard layout. Would get 5 stars with option to show traditional Chinese characters (Taiwan, Hong Kong) and some kind of category browsing option. Students note: As with any widely spoken language (like English), some expressions are regional, e.g. saying \\346\\227\\251\\344\\270\\212\\345\\245\\275 in Taiwan may result in getting some strange looks, they understand it but use \\346\\227\\251\\345\\256\\211 instead. \\\"You\\'re welcome\\\" is usually \\344\\270\\215\\345\\256\\242\\346\\260\\243 in Taiwan instead of what is used here, etc. This app is a great study tool and a way to interact more when abroad, you\\'ll make friends who will teach you the nuances later :)",
