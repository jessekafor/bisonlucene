    "description": "Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa is a highly rated turn based strategy game which takes place on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. You are in the command of the German WWII armed forces - tanks, infantry and air force units - and the object of the game is to conquer the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. To have a chance to seize the top spot in the Hall of Fame you need to skillfully encircle scores of Red Army infantry units with your panzers, while battling both the feared T-34 tank units and the notorious Russian weather. FEATURES:+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Reinforcements and replacement units, plus new unit types - like Tiger I tanks - if the war lasts several years.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, ability to cross rivers without losing move points, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units (real - NATO - web 2.0), difficulty levels, etc.+ A large range of WWII units under your command: tanks, infantry, motorized infantry, weak Axis infantry, Waffen SS troops, the German air force and espionage units. Meanwhile, the Red Army starts with weaker infantry, cavalry and tank units, but as the weeks pass, is reinforced with stronger Siberian and T-34 tank units.+ Weather modelling: Spring/autumn mud slows movement, while winter reduces line-of-sight and freezing cold hampers units, especially mechanized ones.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.+ Inexpensive: The entire WWII eastern front for the price of a coffee!In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.One of the compliments that this wargame has received is that many users have compared it to the classic  strategic board games by Avalon Hill and GMT.If you want to test this WWII game, a LITE version is available for free. It includes all the features, but the game will stop after you reach over 30 VPs.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google+!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of the Second World War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles.",

        "comment": "Joni replied that there are many reasons for the lack of an \\\"undo\\\" function, chief one being cheaters using it to get ahead in the Hall of Fame (HoF). He claimed this has happened in earlier games. The additional memory could also crash older versions of Android. To avoid careless fingers, he suggested changing to a bigger hex size, and set \\\"Misclick prevention\\\" to \\\"Very aggressive\\\". The game will supposedly ignore any touch between 2 hexes in this setting. However, after playing for a month, I found there is hardly any difference in the setting changes; it is still too easy to tap the wrong hex when moving or selecting units. Personally, I would gladly be barred from any HoF standing in return for an \\\"undo\\\", but since this is a major attraction of the game, I can understand his reluctance to change this feature. The ridiculous battle results that happen often is less easy to overlook. I do not know how results are calculated, but the frequency in which the AI beat the odds led me to suspect it\\'s more than just a \\'bad roll of the dice\\'. Difficult is one thing, but having your careful planning thwarted time and again by a cheating AI is another. Buy if you enjoy pulling at your hair",

        "comment": "Achtung! For those who don\\'t want to spend hours (days? Months?) addicted to an excellent, well thought out and executed turn-based strat, don\\'t buy this game. Purchased last October and it has played hell with my ability to study. It\\'s easy to get the hang of the mechanics, takes hours to master (check the HOF: top players are able to crush it in,  what.  40 turns? Personal best is under 100 but wow.). So fun! Group your units, hit hard where the enemy is weakest. Good luck.",
