        "title": "Mixed Thoughts",
        "comment": "If you\\'re happy to accept unrealistically swift ships and impossibly tight turning circles then this is quite a nice game. The graphics are simple but very attractive, and the controls are clear and straightforward. Having said that, I shan\\'t be buying the full version, partly because I found mission 4 impossibly hard after sailing through the first three (pun intended), and partly because of a number of shortcomings that let the game down.  Firstly the text is both a little hammy and in need of the attentions of a spell checker. Then there is the matter of the game playing \\\"upside down\\\" on my tablet (a Nexus 10). Of course I can invert my tablet, but there is already code in the game to use the orientation sensor so it could easily be fixed. Finally the strategic map is very shabby compared to the main game graphics. As well as needing some more details, its scroll control is way too sensitive and it needs a zoom control. Oh, and for a game that has you holding your tablet like a steering wheel it would be much nicer if the cannon controls were under your left and right thumbs instead of in the lower-right corner.  I trust others will have better luck with mission 4!",

        "comment": "First mission - I don\\'t see my own ship or the enemy pinnace, only their shadow and wake. Strange, because the three Spanish merchants are rendered nicely. OK, still playable. Second mission - my ship is still missing, but the view get obstructed by some single-color triangles, which are clearly not supposed to be there. Also, no exit button? Do I really have to use an appkiller every time I stop playing this? No, thank you.",
