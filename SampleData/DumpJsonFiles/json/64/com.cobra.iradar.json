If there are more than x number of false alerts reported for a specific area, the software would know to mute that particular warning.",

Not so, and I just can\\'t understand why cobra would not have included an option to play sound through bluetooth speakers. 5 stars if they fix that.",

It would be nice if the on-screen alert would show over other apps to help with noticing the radar when music or wind is loud. 2. The UI feels a little dated, like something that was made when Gingerbread was out.  3. A way to connect to a Bluetooth OBD-II sensor and use the speed data to compare with a database of known speedlimits, mute notifications if you are going under a user set speed tolerance. (eg. a limit of 10 over the speed limit, if the user is going 56 in a 45, allow the detector to beep)",
