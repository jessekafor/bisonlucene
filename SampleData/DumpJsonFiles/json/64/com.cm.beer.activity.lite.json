        "comment": "I like the connectivity; dropdown menus for beer notes; star ratings; beer list backup; connection for info about beer styles. Cons:search is poor or not working for me; no barcode reader; no wish list; supposedly allows photos but never worked for me. Recently updated but w/o log, so don\\'t know what changed, and couldn\\'t find contact info on dev\\'s site. Other beers apps aren\\'t great and have flaws but are better than this: Beer (Metosphere), Beercloud, Pintley, maybe Brewster.Wish one had all good features",
