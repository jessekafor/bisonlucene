With the very cool ability to make desktop shortcuts (using the plug-in), you can use Tasker and Autoshortcut to set up some nice workflows (e.g. set the input, change the volume, and change the channel). The additional plug-ins really add to an already great app. Very responsive developer. Thanks for making an app that saves time and makes DirecTV more convenient!",
