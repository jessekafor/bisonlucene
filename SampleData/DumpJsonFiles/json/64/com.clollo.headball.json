    "description": "You are in the stadium  and you have to help the players during a competition of balloon head shots. Your goal is to jump instead of players who get tired. When one of them gets tired asking for help, and you have to blow it up at the exact moment he is about to receive the ball. To make them jump you have to press on the help message. A perfect jump can earn 10 points, a well done 5 points and only one limit point. For each game we have 3 balls.In Head Ball are two game modes: Arcade and By Level. In the arcade mode the goal is not to drop the ball ever to gain access to the next level and beat the overall record. By Level mode you can select the level to play with (1 to 5) with the aim of improving the level of individual records.",
