        "comment": "I almost apporved of it my only dissapointment is i cannot expand my restaurant. And even though i joined thier club to be able to invite friends they dont alow me and always insist tha i should signed up again so i decide to uninstall the game unless you can fix the system. So the game can acnolage me as a memeber and i can expand my restaurant and invite friends hope u can fix this as well as to level up the chefs a little faster to be able to cook the other dishes ill be waiting",
