        "comment": "This app was not design for Cell Phone. The main objective of Fusion is Cross Browser compatibility.  if you don\\'t have a tablet or a computer you can delete this APP it was not designed for you.  I will recommend you to talk with your local MLS provider and ask them to develop something for cell phone use only.  In Connecticut we have CT Real Mobil > you will notice that has an agent login (from there they control their listings and contacts) and the general public classic search for everybody else.",

Most of the complaints are related to the speed and ease of use. Firstly don\\'t try to thumb tap like most apps. You need to use the Trac pad located in the bottom left corner. If you can figure this out it works quite well. Also speed can be related to the device or connection. The app needs work but if you can figure out the trac pad it can be very useful in the field.",

With the source code of their puffin browswer, I could have put this together in about 15 minutes.  This is an app store for the android devices and so this app should be designed for android devices.  I have no clue why they have a mouse/keyboard function when that is already built into android devices.",
