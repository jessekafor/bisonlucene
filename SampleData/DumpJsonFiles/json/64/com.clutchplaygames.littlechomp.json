Love the artwork and all the different styles of insects and fruit. I love that you get enough coins to unlock and use power-ups without having to buy them (but still can buy if you really want/need to). Overall, a simple and well-made concept with great art and music. Runs well, plays well, and is definitely addictive to play! Was glad to see it become available to more than just iOS devices :)",

It does have the problem of usually muffling the sound while I\\'m playing, and then getting louder again when I complete the level.  It would be better if the sound level was constant.",
