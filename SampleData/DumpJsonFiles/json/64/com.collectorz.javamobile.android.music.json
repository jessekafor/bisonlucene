        "comment": "I\\'ve had the desktop and iPhone versions for several years and they worked well. When I first started using them I had trouble syncing over wifi but that was fixed. The Android app on the Samsung S4 has worked very well, no issues syncing and it looks great on the phone.  I have about 1500 albums in my library both CDs and Records.  Great program and the app seems to work well on the 4S.",

With current functionality and requirement to have purchased desktop application, I do not understand why people should pay for this.",

        "title": "Just what they say...",
        "comment": "This program does just what they say it does.  It is as others have noted very basic.  It would be a bit better if they add the functionality to list by \\\"track title\\\" (track titles are currently included in the album data).  It would also be nice if the \\\"songwriter\\\" field was included (for listing(s) and/or search).  That said, the PC side of this program allows for those and almost any other feature you\\'d care to reference your cataloged collection with.  I am currently adding my (approximately) 2,500 albums and 2,000 CDs, and have had no problems yet.  When I am done with that I will be adding all of my own recordings from DAT.    It is nice having this inventory with me when I am away from my PC.",
