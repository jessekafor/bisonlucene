    "description": "Conflicts: D-Day is a highly rated turn based strategy game which takes place on the Western Front during the Second World War. General Eisenhower has stepped down and you are in the command of the Allied invasion force - tank, airborne, infantry and air force units - and the object of the game is to break out from the D-Day beachheads and liberate as much of Nazi-occupied France as possible, as quickly as possible. To have a chance to seize the top spot in the Hall of Fame you need to skillfully encircle German units commanded by Erwin Rommel, while battling both the regular Wehrmacht divisions and the feared Panzer VI (Tiger I) tank units.FEATURES:+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: difficulty levels, what to draw on the map, custom font and map size.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defence performance, ability to cross rivers without losing extra move points.+ A wide variety of units under your command: Sherman M4 tanks, American/British/Canadian infantry divisions, paratroopers, special units like US Army Rangers and Royal Marines Commando Brigade, Crab mine cleaner tanks and air force units. Meanwhile, the German Wehrmacht starts with coastal fortifications, and weaker ost battalions and static infantry units, but as the days pass, is reinforced with regular infantry, Waffen SS and Panzer divisions.+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup of the real 1944 Normandy landings - including the divisions that saw combat during the D-Day and the following Normandy Campaign in World War II.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.In order to be a victorious general, it is essential that you learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.To get a sense of how Conflicts: D-Day works, try out Operation Barbarossa LITE -- http://bit.ly/GVaC8a -- which uses the same mechanics as Conflicts: D-Day.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in turning the tide of the Second World War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine whether or not you are connected to the internet so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (visit settings to turn the feature OFF or alter its behaviour).",

        "comment": "I have most of this designer\\'s titles and can easily recommmend all. I don\\'t have any qualms about buying  multiple titles to play opposing sides, I am happy to support. Considering the huge amount of money that I\\'ve spent previously searching for solid gameplay, these games are a fantastic bargain and well worth any strategist\\'s efforts. S&T, Wargamer, and Command fans take notice. Look forward to any future endeavours, hopefully some earlier historical periods where combat was really dicey. 100 Years War, Crusades, Mongol expansion, the Armadas, Charlemagne, et al. These are the way to a commander\\'s heart. Kind regards",
