        "comment": "This app needs to save where you left off during a quiz if you decide to stop halfway through. You can b on question 25 of 30, leave the app, and now youre gunna have to start over again because it doesnt save. It will save completed test scores though, so u can track your scores. Other than that and a few gramatical things, its a great app. Plz update tho",

        "comment": "Positives-Great tool to learn FF1. Includes JPRs, relevant quizzes, chapter note cards, rookie jobs & etc. Much better as a study guide than the Essentials guide book.  Negatives- I was primarily using the quizzes & note cards to help me get through academy chapter tests. And my test scores were improving. =D Major problem is that my system was updated (ASUS transformer prime t700) & I can no longer get past any of the 1st quiz questions once it is answered. This applies to all of the quizzes.  With that said, everything else works, I believe. So great overall job minus some grammar/ spelling. Most comprehensive app for FF1. Please fix the quizzes and expand on loss control. Thanks!",
