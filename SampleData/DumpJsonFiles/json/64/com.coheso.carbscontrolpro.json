Highly recommend you take the time to make custom entries to ensure higher accuracy.  Takes some time, but is worth it in the long run.  Just really wish this update included a fix for the font size on the main screen.  Too small for the resolution of my Galaxy S4.  This would be an easy fix... hope it comes soon.",

        "comment": "I\\'m now over 8 months into Atkins and almost 60 lbs lighter and a big reason I was able to stick with it I have to credit this app for. Even though there is a big database of foods built into the app I usually prefer to make my own custom entries and save them in favorites. I like that it tracks not only carbs and net carbs but calories, fats, protein sodium as well. .Have tried several other carb apps but this one works the best for me. .",

        "comment": "it\\'s the best carb counter out there. It is not very intuitive and seems that, with a few simple tweaks, could be a very good carb counter. Why, oh why, can\\'t anyone come up with a system like My Fitness Pal or Fat Secret that simply tracks carbs? I mean, how hard is that to do? I would pay money for it if someone ever does. I want to see the carbs I consume for each meal and throughout the day. I want a bar-code scanner. I want to save favorite meals/recipes that can be EASILY assigned to any meal of the day. I don\\'t want to see the calories in overview screens (i.e., it should be elsewhere or should be able to be toggled on).  I want to track water intake, though this isn\\'t a deal-breaker. Please, if any developers are reading this, take heed!",

        "comment": "I bought this app on my RAZR MAXX to allow me to look up and track carb usage for my 4 year old who is a Type 1 diabetic. After reading the reviews and the specs on the app, I purchased it and began running it through it\\'s paces. That\\'s when the disappointment set in. After every one or two food searches, the app would crash and need to be restarted. To be sure, I even rebooted her phone. By the time I determined that this app was too unstable to use, the 15 minute period had run out, and I can\\'t find a way",
