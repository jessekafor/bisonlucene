    "description": "Conflicts: Eastern Front is a huge turn based strategy game which takes place on the Russian Front in World War II.You are in command of the German WWII armed forces - generals, tanks, infantry and air force units - and the object of the game is to conquer the Soviet Union as quickly as possible.This is a huge game, and if you haven't played games fom the Conflict-series, you may want to start with Operation Barbarossa or D-Day before taking on the Eastern Front. If you want to test the game mechanics of Conflict-Series, a LITE version of Operation Barbarossa is available for free.What's different in Eastern Front compared to Operation Barbarossa:+ Scaled up: Larger map, more units, more panzers & Waffen SS, more cities... Now you can finally outmanoeuvre more than just couple of units to form Ã¼ber-encirclements.+ Tactical Areas/MPs: Some hexagons are connected together forming slowly evolving Tactical Areas, and you can move between such hexagons using Tactical MPs instead of regular MPs. This opens up a completely new tactical dimension.+ Economy & Production: You decide how to use the industrial resources that you capture: Build railway networks, produce Rail MPs, manufacture minefields, fuel, etc.+ Railway Network: To navigate the huge game area efficiently you need to plan where to build railway network.+ Generals: Generals support the closest units in battle at the cost of 1 MP, while the front line units located too far away from Generals might lose 1 MP.- Removed partizans, spies, full map, quotations and stats to reduce memory usage and to streamline the gameplay.FEATURES:+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, ability to cross rivers without losing move points, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units (real - NATO - web 2.0), custom font and map size, etc.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets.+ Inexpensive: The entire WWII eastern front for the price of a coffee!In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of the Second World War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine whether or not you are connected to the Internet so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles.",

For a free game that would be okay, for a paid game I\\'d really enjoy it more with some idea of how to use rail MP, tactical MP, why I should choose one production over another, etc.  Not saying its a bad game, I am enjoying playing it, and don\\'t regret purchasing it.  I just wish there were a better way to learn how to play than trial and error.",

Play some of the other games by Joni before committing to this juggernaut. While nowhere near the complexity of some PC wargames, the sheer scale here takes some work to master. You cannot win by force alone. On normal difficulty, it took me about a month of playing to win a 2-year campaign. The Soviet hordes will overwhelm you if you aren\\'t careful!",
