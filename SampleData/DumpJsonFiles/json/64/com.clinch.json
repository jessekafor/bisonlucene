        "comment": "*Edit 2* It works a whole lot better now. The gallery works a lot faster. But if like me you have a lot of pictures it still loads all the files. Maybe a simpler solution would be that the user could tell the app a self designated file path so that you could setup a new folder and move pictures and videos into it. That way only the stuff you want is in there.  I also went to download a video only to get a message that it\\'s \\302\\2430.54 To download a video with material that I have supplied. No can do. :-(",

Some suggestions: - Allow us to save the rendered movies into our smartphone galleries - Allow us to delete the rendered videos from our profiles  - Option of not choosing any theme when we render videos, I.e. more flexibility/creativity can be exercised on users end.  - Allow us to render a 15sec video for Instagram video  Thanks! Keep up the gd work.",
