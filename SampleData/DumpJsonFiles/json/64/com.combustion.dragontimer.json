    "description": "The Guild Wars 2 Dragon Timer allows you to quickly and easily check The Shatterer, Tequatl the Sunless, and the Claw of Jormag to see when they will be up. Gone are the days of alt+tab-ing out of Guild Wars 2 just so you can check when a dragon will be up! At work? No problem! Just whip out your phone and see which dragon you can slay tonight when you get home!FEATURES:* All US and European Servers* Status of all three dragons: The Shatterer, Tequatl the Sunless, and the Claw of Jormag* Note: If you use a high-resolution tablet, the app may look slightly distorted. I'm working on an HD version to fix this issue.* More?

Secondly and most important it drains battery like a game on steroids! Why do 3 timers need the max 1.4GHz of the GS3 all the time (single thread as well). Please fix and will update rating.",

While I appreciate what this app _does_ do, it should be rather trivial to add the rest of the event timers. If this were a program for personal use, I could understand, but as it is I don\\'t really see any excuse for the very limited scope of this app. I\\'m keeping it installed in the hope that I get an update notification at some point for a version with improved functionality. The foundation is solid; just build on it!",

Other than these things, the structure of the app is simple and wonderful. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to more improvements and updates in the future!",
