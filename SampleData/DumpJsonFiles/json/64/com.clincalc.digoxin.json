Additionally, the calculator is capable of providing a loading and maintenance dose recommendation based on the Koup and Jusko equations for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.This app is the mobile version of the popular digoxin calculator found on http://clincalc.comThis calculator is not appropriate for the following patient populations, or may require a higher degree of clinical judgment: significant drug interactions (eg, amiodarone, quinidine, verapamil, or macrolide antibiotics), end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and acute renal failure or unstable renal function.",
