    "description": "Conflicts: Panzer Missions is a turn based strategy game which takes place on the eastern front during the Second World War.You are in command of a squadron of German WWII units - tanks, infantry and artillery units - and the object of the game is to finish missions as quickly as possible.FEATURES: + Quick-to-play missions, which evolve from easy to hard as your career progresses. First assignments take just a handful of turns/minutes to finish.+ Simple resource management with supply depots: Transport ammo to artillery and fuel to SS, motorized, and tank units to keep the spearhead of your attack going.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.+ Competitive: Measure your skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: What to draw on the map, minimap, custom font and map sizes.+ A large range of units under your command: tanks (beginning with Panzer IV, and later PzV Panther and PzVI Tiger), infantry, mobilised infantry, weak Axis infantry, Waffen SS troops, and artillery. Meanwhile, the Red Army starts with weaker infantry, cavalry and BT-tank units, but in later missions is reinforced with stronger T-34 tank units and motorized infantry.In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely a good idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.To get a sense of how Conflicts: Panzer Missions works, try out Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa LITE -- http://goo.gl/vLuaP -- which uses the same mechanics as Conflicts: Panzer Missions.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in the offensive to push through the Soviet lines!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles.",

The scale of the game is just right for this level of micro management. The Fuhrer will be pleased! 10 Stars if it were possible. To anyone sitting on the fence, don\\'t let the basic map graphics stop you. Download the free Operation Barbarossa Lite and play a few turns. Then you\\'ll have to buy a few games in this series like I have.",
