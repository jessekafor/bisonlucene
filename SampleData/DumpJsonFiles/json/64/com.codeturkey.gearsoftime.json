        "comment": "This is a great game. Its well thought out and lots of fun. However, in order to receive a 5 star rating, there is one glaring issue that needs to be fixed. At the end of a level, that is, after you\\'ve completed the objective, there needs to be a way to continue working on the level as you have it. The current implementation forces the user to start from scratch if they want to play the same level after completing it.  This makes  even attempting the perfection bonus drudgerous. Fix this issue for 5 *",
