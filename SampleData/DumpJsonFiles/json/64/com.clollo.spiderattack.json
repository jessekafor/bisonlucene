    "description": "Spider Attack is a game where you have to defend yourself from the attack of the spiders. To do this all you have is the air guns with which to shoot against and occasionally a ray fulminant. To shoot, simply click on the most suitable cannon to hit the spiders. There are two game modes: Arcade and By Level. In arcade mode the goal is to survive to gain access to the next level and beat the overall record. By Level mode you can select the level to play with (1 to 25) with the aim of improving the level of the single surviving record as much as possible.",
