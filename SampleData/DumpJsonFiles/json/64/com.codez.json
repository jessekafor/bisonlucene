    "description": "Introduction:Code-Z is a highly intuitive and innovative social word game. It is designed uniquely to cut many barriers. Once you have learnt the basics of the game, you can play it with just a pen and paper, like hangman, or you can even play it with just mental workout. Because of this unique usability, it is suitable for playing as a group game in parties (like dumb charades) or as a brain teaser among family/friends (like master mind) or at lunch with friends to keep the fingers off the phone or just while lying in the bed and also in many other ways and situations. Moreover, it teaches you the essence of coded communication in a very simple way. Kids can get familiar with these concepts very early and at the same time improve their vocabulary. This game can be easily taught to a visually challenged person or to a person with hearing impairment, and you can as well play with them and they are also able to play it among themselves. Hence it makes it the ideal word game to bridge the gap between us, humans, no matter what disabilities we have. All you need to do is exchange codes between 0 to 5, either with voice or with hands or any other way suitable for you. For more info on the game please visit the following page: http://www.facebook.com/CodeZ.Word.Puzzle.Game.You can also play the game on facebook at: http://apps.facebook.com/codez_fb/index.htmlBasic concept:This game is based on grouping the entire english alphabet set into easily memorizable words. Totally there are 6 words consisting of 2 five letter words (BACK-Q, VEST-Z) and 4 four letter words (WHIG, FORD, JUMP and LYNX.) . Each word consists of exactly one vowel and none of the letters repeat themselves. These words are arranged into a 5x6 matrix as follows:..0  1  2  3  4  50 B  V  W  F  J  L1 A  E  H  O  U  Y2 C  S  I  R  M  N3 K  T  G  D  P  X4 Q  ZDuring the game these words will be displayed vertically. Thatâs why I call them vord/s (vertical word/s). Each vord is complementary to its column number. While playing the game on the device, a random combination of vords are displayed. The numbers in each column put together is called the âcodeâ. The goal of the game is to find as many words as possible horizontally by choosing one letter from each column left to right.Note:If you want to play the game with your friends using a pen and paper, or on a board or with just mental workout, then it is useful to memorize the vords along with the column number.In the situation of playing with a hearing impaired person, Player-1 can communicate the code by forming the column numbers (code) with the right hand in sequence. For example, the code for CALL will be 0055. You can form a circle with your hand to show zeros and 5 fingers to show fives. After a code is broken Player-2 can convey the results by showing the row numbers with the left hand and the column numbers with the right hand at the same time and in sequence. The word itself can be shown as:...........0  1  2  3  4  5 (right hand)........0  B  V  W  F  J  L........1  A  E  H  O  U  Y........2  C  S  I  R  M  N........3  K  T  G  D  P  X........4  Q  Z(left hand)",
