    "description": "You are in the countryside and you must take on the fly the apples falling from the tree.Fruit Drop is available in two game modes: Arcade and By Level.In the arcade mode the objective is to collect as many apples as possible to have access to the next level and beat the overall record. For each level you have 15 seconds available, plus any bonuses and a maximum of three apples to drop. By Level mode you can select the level to play with (1 to 15) with the aim of improving the level of individual records. For each game we cannot drop out of the basket at most three apples. During the game we have to be careful not to take any worm that falls from the tree, or the game ends immediately, and no worm-eaten apple, which is equivalent to an apple lost.The golden apple allows us to recover a lost apple apples while larger make us earn more points.",

        "comment": "I really like the idea of the game but when i move the basket around, my finger covers up the entire basket n i cant c that well. Thr shood b options on changing that, or at least we shood b able to use the rite n left side to move the basket, so our finger doesnt interfere. Other than that issue, nice simplistic game.",
