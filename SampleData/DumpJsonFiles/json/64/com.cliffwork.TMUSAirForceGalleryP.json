I was happy for a while, but all of a sudden I started getting \\\"+\\\" at the top of the screen, and it was ads sent by this program.  It constantly pushes random ads to your notification menu, 24/7.  (Found it using \\\"AirPush Detector\\\".)  As a former USAF pilot, I was delighted to have all the pics that come with this, but not at the expense of ads and ads and ads for BS.",
