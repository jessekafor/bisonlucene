    "description": "DASH's Action Figure Collector app works with the DASH web site, www.Collector-ActionFigures.com.  Action figure lovers can register for free to access the largest, structured catalog of action figures. Manage their collection and wanted list. Buy and sell from fellow collectors. Share their collection. Tell their collecting story and connect with other collectors. Value their full collection.The DASH app for Android enables collectors to search via text string or by barcode scanning from the device to look up figures from DASH's vast catalog. See awesome photos and get more info about the figures (year, manufacturer, etc.)  You can even view associated video reviews as posted from the vibrant YouTube reviewer community.For collectors that have upgraded on the web site to the premium \"DASH Collector's Club\", the mobile app will enable more features.  Collectors can sync their collections to their phone.  They can add to their collections and wanted list from the phone.  Best yet, taking pictures of their own figures is amazingly fast and easy. Sync your collection to the Android phone, pick a figure, tap the camera, snap a picture and wirelessly sync it to your collection on the DASH site.  If your item is for sale on the DASH Marketplace, your photo is also instantly posted there too!All in all, the combination of the DASH web site and mobile apps is a revolution for action figure lovers - raising the bar from eBay, notebooks, Excel files and clumsy photo uploads.",

I still don\\'t feel like it gives an accurate collectors pricing for my figures but it is a very easy way to track what I have whenever I want to. I like being able to print the list, and share my collection. Please update the pricing, these are retail prices that are very outdated.",
