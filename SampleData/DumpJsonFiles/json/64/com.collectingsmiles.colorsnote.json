That will make the program quite usable while we are waiting for brush opacity to be implemented at a later date.",

Also sometime it wont zoom in and out.  Also i wish the back and forward options were easier to get to...since i use them a LOT! :) but i highly recommend this app! Great interface. great brushes!  Hope it gets updates!!!",
