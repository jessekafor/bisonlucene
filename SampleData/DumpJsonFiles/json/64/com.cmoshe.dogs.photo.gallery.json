    "description": "Amazing dogs photo gallery. All existing dog breeds in one free HD photo collection. Best puppies pics.Dog breeding is the practice of mating selected specimens with the intent to maintain or produce specific qualities and characteristics.Dogs reproduce without human interference, so their offsprings' characteristics are determined by natural selection. Domestic dogs may be intentionally bred by their owners. A person who intentionally mates dogs to produce puppies is referred to as a dog breeder. Breeding relies on the science of genetics, so the breeder with a knowledge of canine genetics, health, and the intended use for the dogs attempts to breed suitable dogs.Humans have maintained populations of useful animals around their places of habitat since pre-historic times.They have intentionally fed dogs considered useful, while neglecting or killing others, thereby establishing a relationship between humans and certain types of dog over thousands of years. Over these millennia, domesticated dogs have developed into distinct types, or groups, such as livestock guardian dogs, hunting dogs, and sighthounds. To maintain these distinctions, humans have intentionally mated dogs with certain characteristics to encourage those characteristics in the offspring.Through this process, hundreds of dog breeds have been developed. Initially, the ownership of working and, later, purebred dogs, was a privilege of the wealthy. Nowadays, many people can afford to buy a dog. Some breeders chose to breed purebred dogs, while some prefer to produce crossbred dogs, claiming that the outcross is healthier than original breeds, and avoiding linebreeding or inbreeding.Some of the most popular dog breeds pictures in this free photo gallery: Labrador Retriever, English Cocker Spaniel, English Springer Spaniel, German Shepherd, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel \t, Golden Retriever, West Highland White Terrier, Boxer, Border Terrier, Bulldog, Golden Retriever, Yorkshire Terrier, Bernese Mountain Dog, Poodle, Shih Tzu, St. Bernard, Spanish Mastiff, South Russian Ovcharka, German Shepherd dog pics, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Norfolk Spaniel, Pudelpointer, Tibetan Terrier free images, Giant Schnauzer, Teddy Roosevelt Terrier and many more.",

        "comment": "I own a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel. The pictures you have of that breed are very good. It would be nice if you also had a section with a short description and some facts about each breed. Things like average size (height), weight, colors, temperament, behavioral attributes, health problems etc. Then you\\'d have a fantastic site that I\\'d rate 5 stars and would be willing to buy. I\\'ve paid as much as $20 for such a manual. This could be much better and portable. One other suggestion would be to add a search tool at the top to at least get you to the first letter of the breed I.e. a thru z and allow user to pick a letter which will at least skip them to the page closest to what they are looking for. Would save a lot of flipping.",
