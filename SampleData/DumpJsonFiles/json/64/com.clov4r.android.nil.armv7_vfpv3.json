When it installs it didn\\'t work, sends you to black screen. solution was to uninstall and reinstall a couple times then when I ended up at the black screen I hit the back button and there Moboplayer was in all its shining glory!!! soooooo 4 stars since it made me work for it ***update:  stopped  working after day but mobo player app was updated so works fine now",

Also, it would be nice if it would list just the folders you select, then let you pick which of those folders to view. I don\\'t need to see every video from my selected folders when I just want to watch something from my movie folder. Other than those two things, this app is perfect. Acer Iconia Pad A500.",
