Two issues that bother me is that A) there is negative distance which effects high score so if i travel to the left 1000units then back right 200 units my score is 800 which is wrong I traveled 1200 it makes it more worth killing myself then completing missions. B) Power ups don\\'t combined if I get a 4x and 2x after I get only the 2x power up. Oh it also restarts if a call comes in while playing.",

The biggest thing that I think would be cool is if the ship didn\\'t slow down when you stop firing the engine, and would keep drifting in the direction it\\'s moving. Then if you want to stop or change directions, you would fire in a new direction. With sparser debris I think the challenge level could be maintained.",
