        "comment": "I love Book Collector for PC, and willingly forked over the money for it. I was equally excited to find an Android companion app. However, I am quite miffed about the cost and lack of features. First I had to update my PC version ($24.95 AUD) to be able to sync with the $10 Android version I had just bought. GREEDY BUGGERS.  As for features, the few that exist certainly don\\'t justify the price tag. The Android app needs to be able to sync with PC or Mac version, needs to be editible and I should be able to add and delete from Android. Considering how much money I just paid, it\\'s not a lot to ask for. The PC version gets 5 stars, but the Android app only deserves 2 stars",

Instead I\\'m still forced to lug all my books to my pc for adding to my collection. I love the pc version, but his app should allow adding/editing/synchronization to be worth the money I paid for it.",

The iPhone /ipad app is a thousand times better; you can actually add books with the app. Why would you assume that Android users would not appreciate this feature? As this app is, it should have been FREE!!",
