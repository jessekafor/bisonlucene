    "description": "Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa is a highly rated turn based strategy game which takes place on the Eastern Front during the Second World War.This is a free LITE version, which means that it has all the features, but the game will end after you have reached over 30 Victory Points. For the full version of Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa, see http://bit.ly/zRMWGPYou are in the command of the German WWII armed forces - tanks, infantry and air force units - and the object of the game is to conquer the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. To have a chance to seize the top spot in the Hall of Fame you need to skillfully encircle scores of Red Army infantry units with your panzers, while battling both the feared T-34 tank units and the notorious Russian weather.FEATURES:+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup of Operation Barbarossa.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Reinforcements and replacement units, plus new unit types if the war lasts several years.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defence performance, extra move points, damage resistance, ability to cross rivers without losing extra MPs, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units (real - nato - web 2.0), difficulty levels.+ A large range of units under your command: tanks, infantry, motorized infantry, weak Axis infantry, Waffen SS troops, the German air force and espionage units. Meanwhile, the Red Army starts with weaker infantry, cavalry and tank units, but as the weeks pass, is reinforced with stronger Siberian and T-34 tank units.+ Weather modeling: Spring/autumn Mud slows movement, while winter reduces line-of-sight and freezing cold hampers units (especially mechanized ones).+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.In order to be a victorious general in this strategy game, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google+!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1One of the compliments that this wargame has received is that many players have compared it favourably to the classic  board games by Avalon Hill and GMT.Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of the Second World War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles.",

        "comment": "I really love all of this developers titles. They make sense and are very rewarding-considering you are any good at these type of games. I do not like the way the map moves around the screen, it would make more sense to move freely. The other complaint is just that more of a tutorial would be nice. Overall, the way units interact with one another is realistic but sometimes a few infanty take out a tank, and other similar situations. That could be a little more refined but it is a very small complaint :-)",
