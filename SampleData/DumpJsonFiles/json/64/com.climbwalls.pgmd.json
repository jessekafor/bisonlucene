Please try this out before buying.

The only issue I have is that this app seems designed for use on a tablet. Everything was squished together and hard to use. No fault to the development team just some thing to keep in mind.",

I love pathfinder and YES it does work perfectly with it. BUT like the dev says YOU have to customize it yourself.  The attribute mods (bonuses) are made by changing a formula in the Campaign tab.  It does require a little work.  I am surprised some uses haven\\'t figured this out.  Anyway, thought I would add my 2 cents.",

I know it\\'s a demo, but when changing the attributes bonus formulae doesn\\'t work in the demo, why should I expect it to work in the full product?  I hope pgm 2.0 spruces things up a bit. And please remember that demo functionality is a must if you want skeptics like myself to buy the full version.",
