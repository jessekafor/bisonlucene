    "description": "Color Leap automatically enhances the image quality of your photos by:1. Correcting over-exposed and under-exposed part of your image.2. Compensating for external factors such as haze, smoke, dirty lens, etc.3. Sharpening image objects that are slightly out of focus.4. Reducing the colored noise speckles that commonly occur in low light conditions.Unlike other photo enhancement apps, Color Leap requires no user input or manual adjustments - no buttons, no sliders, no menus. True photo enhancement was never so easy.Snap a photo and instantly compare the Original and Processed images.You can also enhance an existing photo from the phone's photo Gallery.Note: You will not notice substantial changes for photos taken in good lighting conditions.You can email your comments to android@colorleap.com.Enjoy and let us know what you think!www.colorleap.com",

It is easy to use, great for low-light and brings out small details.   I am a chef and I use this to make my food look irresistible!!!  It really brings out the colors in food, it helps with contrast and also darkens shadows. The texture of my food is evident and looks more crisp.",
