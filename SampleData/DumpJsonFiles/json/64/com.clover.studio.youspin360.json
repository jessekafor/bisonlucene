It just sits there and does nothing after you fill in the registration form. So, I figured I\\'d download the app and give it a try. Download was fine and quick and it took pictures ok, BUT, that was it. After I took the pics, you have to upload the file and every time I tried to upload it I was asked to \\\"register\\\". After wasting time filling in the registration form, I got an error message \\\" the app is executing a forced shut down, try again later\\\". So I gave up..Too bad, this could be a nice app but until the developer gets the bugs out, don\\'t waste your time..",
