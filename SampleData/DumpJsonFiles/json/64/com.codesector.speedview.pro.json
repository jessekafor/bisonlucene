Suitable for running, car driving, biking, or hiking.â¢ High accuracyGPS-based speedometer that is more accurate than the one in your car.â¢ Linear compassShows your current direction of travel. A compass mode is also available.â¢ HUD modeMirrors the numbers so you can place your phone on your car's dashboard and see the speed reflected in the front glass. You can check out this video to see how it works: http://youtu.be/rzda7CQ-ZAUâ¢ Speed graphDisplays a graph chart covering the last several minutes.â¢ Speed warningYou can set the speed limits for three different types of roads so that when you go too fast a visual alert or sound will notify you.â¢ Display unitsSupports units such as miles, kilometers, and nautical miles.â¢ GPX track exportEnables you to save your current track to the SD card or email it to someone. The GPX format is supported by Google Earth and many other programs: http://www.topografix.com/gpx_resources.aspâ¢ Background modeYou can minimize the program and keep it running in the background. It will work as usual and even notify you when you exceed the speed limit.Please note that the accuracy of GPS measurements is affected by a number of factors including atmospheric conditions, obstructions and the visibility of satellites.If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them on our blog: http://blog.codesector.com/",

Update: developer want sure what problem was, however i found that if recording is stopped then no data is collected. So if you want to see your speed but not record then this app is not for you. Currently only works when recording is on. Up 1 star to 4 stars.",

At the top of Vail pass the elevation is listed at 10,662ft and the altimeter read 10,632ft so only about 30ft off which ain\\'t no thang to me. Would be sweet if on the hybrid screen you had the option to make one of the selectable tiles larger so you can actually see it while the phones on your dashboard. Also would be sweet if you could add GPS based weather an option for those selectable tiles as well. Do this and its a 5 star app all day",
