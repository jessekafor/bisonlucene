    "description": "Do you hate those pesky mosquitoes that seem to buzz annoyingly around you when you are trying to enjoy that summer evening. Well here is your chance to take revenge on those skeeters. This fully interactive game in an augmented reality allows you to use your finger to squash them while moving your phone to find more. Happy Skeeter Beatin'.- Gameplay -Use the touch screen to beat the Skeeters. Beat enough Skeeters within the time limit to advance to the next round.A point is deducted after a level specific number of missing touches.Each round becomes increasingly more difficult with faster Skeeters, shorter time limits, and higher required scores.Bonus Mode is entered when enough points to pass a round has been obtained. Bonus Mode lasts for the remainder of the round, allowing for additional points without the risk of point deductions.Each round ends when the time is up or when all Skeeters for the round have been beaten.- 3D Mode -Utilize phone sensors to track Skeeters in full 360 degree range of motion. Move the phone up, down, left, and right to track and find Skeeters. When no Skeeters are visible, use the sounds to determine their location.- 2D Mode -Restricts Skeeters movements in proximity to the screen. Phone movement has no effect on the game.- HUD -Top Left:  Number of Skeeters required & Remaining Misses (red)Top Right:  Remaining round timeBonus Mode Top Left:  Total Round Score (green)- Game Modes -Hunt 3D: Move the phone to Hunt flying Skeeters.Search 3D: Move the phone to Search for \"motionless\" Skeeters.Bash 3D: Move the phone to Bash a large number of Skeeters.Bash 2D: Bash the Skeeters without using phone sensors.- Settings -Camera Background: Use the phone camera as the background in place of the sky image.Orientation Sensors: Orientation sensors are used in place of the Accelerometer and Magnetic Field sensors. Sensor performance varies on each phone. Choose the setting that provides the smoothest experience.Sound: Play sounds when enabled- Known Issues -Placing the phone in sleep mode while playing can cause the phone sensors to stop reporting the horizontal direction. If this happens, rotating the phone in a full circle can sometimes restart the sensors.- Strategy -Carefully beat Skeeters until reaching the required number for the round. Then take a more aggressive approach as misses no longer result in point loss.Focus on slower Skeeters first sometimes resulting in a combo on a passing by fast Skeeter.Hold the phone steady while attempting to beat them so that they don't suddenly move at the last second due to the sensors.",
