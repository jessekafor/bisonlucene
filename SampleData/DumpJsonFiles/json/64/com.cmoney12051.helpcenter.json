    "description": "This is a mobile app for my new forum startup. Its a forum to help other with their android app development and publishing. Specifically aimed at people using Google app inventor.This is one of the first apps that i have made from the actual android sdk, so this is a bit new for me. Ive done java before so it wasn't that bad, but i've grown accustom to app inventor and its level of difficulty compared to this.
