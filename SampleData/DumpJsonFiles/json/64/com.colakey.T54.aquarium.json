        "comment": "I purchased this app because I recently started aquascapping. the pros: each plant has a nice picture and you can bookmark the one you like. The cons: there is ads! And I keep hitting them because they are placed just above the\\\"next\\\" button and this is super annoying. There is no category? I would have expected a bit more classification than having just pants in alphabetical order. Bottom line, this app need serious improvement for me to give it 5 stars but it is helpful if you are new to aquascaping.",
