        "comment": "Upon trying this app I found that one of the most Important features, being able to scale-crop the image within the canvas didn\\'t work, leaving a tiling effect which didn\\'t exactly work for me. In addition to this there is no way that I can tell to choose the resolution of the finished image. Using a 720p base image the finished product was a little more than 600px square. This is really disappointing because the effect of the filter itself is great.",
