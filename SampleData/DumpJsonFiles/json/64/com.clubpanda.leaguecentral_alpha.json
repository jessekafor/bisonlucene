    "description": "This app is in ALPHA development stage, not all features are complete.League Central is an all-in-one League of Legends application. It will have everything you need to be successful and build up that Elo, and soon, Diamond will be yours. One of the best parts about this app, THERE ARE NO ADS. The app is also stored on your phone, so it can be viewed offline and won't require an internet connection for most features.I am but one person that made this app, and I hate ads just as much as the next guy. For this reason, this app has no ads or anything of the sort, just 100% League of Legends content. I am a Diamond tier LoL player, and wanted to create an app that would help others learn the game as it has a pretty big learning curve. Hopefully, you will be able to use these tools to better learn the game, and improve to become one of the best. This app will include:-Browse Champions and Items to get the knowledge edge on your opponents-An Interactive and detailed Jungle Timer will make you in control of the jungle-Create and manage your own Champion Builds and Sets-Read up on the latest and greatest Champion Guides-Look up Counters and Synergies to find the best champion for your team-Many, many moreLeague Central is currently in Alpha and will have frequent updates as new features are being developed. Tablet support not currently implemented.--------------------League Central is created by one person, Me. So, if you like the app, I would really appreciate you rating and leaving a review.
