        "comment": "Ads never stop coming! Ever since I got this app, I\\'ve received an ad from it at least 5 times a day AND from other different places. Very bad idea to get this app. And the sound when your child is coloring is highly annoying. My phone has to go on vibrate the few times my kids play with this.",
