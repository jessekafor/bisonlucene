        "comment": "However, the control buttons are switched from the standard (movement on the left, action on the right). I\\'m a lefty and it still feels weird. Additionally, the buttons are REALLY small on a phone. A larger size option would be nice. Other than that, pretty groovy simple old-school game.",
