        "comment": "1) I\\'m proud of your efforts to share this remarkable program.  2) Can u develop it:  - to allow copying of each chat bubble to be pasted elsewhere? (as in normal SMS)  - to delete each chat message separately (as in normal SMS)  3) I\\'m so thrilled that this program can allow computer to type & send messages  4) I have found no problems using it  5) I had not been charged for any message  6) I had been able to send messages to anyone, including those without this program installed on their fones.  7) I\\'m using a Samsung Galaxy Note  8) It does need further development for user-friendliness bcos other messaging programs are perhaps slightly easier to use  9) Of course, it uses 3G or WiFi  God bless you",
