It\\'s eliminated 90% of the papers I needed as a GM and with the Adventure Tab I\\'m able to create oodles of quest without having to spread out papers and books.  The use of \\\"loaders\\\" is really cool, adds flavour and a level of uniqueness to your games. Definitely checkout the demo, if you like it then buy it. Any problems contact the dev team, they care and stand by their product.",
