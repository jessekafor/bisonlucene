        "comment": "I used to think this app was pretty basic, but the new update with layers finally made it complete. My only issue is with the eye dropper tool when touching and holding the canvas. It really impedes on making little details correctly. The eye dropper is already in the main menu, so please make an option to turn this on and off.",

It also ties in with the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo 3ds and DSi. In love it. Give it a try. I also have it on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and it really works well with it, except for the fact that it currently doesn\\'t support portrait mode which is what I mostly use. Most drawing apps usually add portrait mode support at some point because of request. I need to email the developer about this.",

        "comment": "The nice thing about Colors! for Android is not seeing artwork made by Colors! 3D. To be honest, I like to be kept that way because there are a huge number of uploads over Colors! 3D. I have this version and the DS homebrew version. This app can see artwork made by the DS.  There are drawbacks here. Seeing the gallery with my Samsung Sratosphere always crashes. So it is deemed useless. However, it does work with my other Android device (WM8850 Netbook). I love the interface and it is beautifully designed.",
