        "comment": "But I already downloaded (and paid) for the phasebook pro of most of these languages and apart from a better looking GUI I\\'m unsure of any reason to pay again. For some reason, a few languages that have phrasebooks are missing here like Cantonese and Russian. I wish this came out before the other phrasebook pros and I would of saved a lot of money.",

Second having the ability to create folders in the favorites would be wonderful!! Your selection of phrases is a lot more realistic than most programs. Will you be adding either or both of my suggestions as updates any time soon??",

It offers many languages and the ability to download phrase dictionaries (or the audio perhaps) to your phone for those languages you wish to use.  This all works fine and the application appears to be stable.  Unfortunately, and this is why it gets 1 star, the application insists on being online to work.  So if you happen to be travelling abroad (you know, where you might want to use a foreign language \\\"phrasebook\\\") and you don\\'t have wifi or mobile data internet access the app is of no use to you at all.  It simply pops up a message to complain you\\'re not online.  There are many other apps that do a better job including the Google Translate app which also allows you to download quite a few translation dictionaries all for free.",
