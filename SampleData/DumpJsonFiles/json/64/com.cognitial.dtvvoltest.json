    "description": "EXCLUSIVE Volume plugin for DirecTV Remote+ Pro only from Cognitial Mobile!** ATTENTION **This app is a FREE PLUGIN for DirecTV Remote+ Pro from Cognitial Mobile.  You can try this plugin with only the free DirecTV Remote+ installed to see if it will work for you.  When Pro is installed, volume and mute can be controlled from within the main DirecTV Remote+ Pro app!You MUST have either DirecTV Remote+ Free or Pro installed to open this app.  See those apps for supported models and be sure to get the other app installed and working before attempting to use this app.MOST people will be unable to control volume with ANY app.  That is just the way it is.  See website for a detailed explanation.  Essentially you either need a network-controllable television, a network-to-IR device, or a phone/tablet capable of emitting IR signals.  Unfortunately all of these are somewhat rare.  I'm the only DirecTV Remote developer who has even attempted volume control and the reason is simple: It's much easier said than done!For more info and help on configuring this plugin, see the FAQ at http://goo.gl/42uoav** CURRENTLY SUPPORTED DEVICES **USING IR:* Global Cache iTach Net-to-IR device* Any IR device connected through HomeSeer* Built-in IR on HTC One devices (supports IR learning)* Built-in IR on select Samsung Galaxy devicesUSING NETWORK (IP CONTROL):* Panasonic Viera televisions (2011+)* Philips televisions (2011+)* Samsung televisions (C series +)* Sharp Aquos televisions* Denon or Marantz AVRs (newer models)* Any Onkyo AVR that can be controlled with OnkyTroller (*requires OnkyTroller to be installed!*)* Yamaha AVRs (newer models)* More will come eventually.  Send me an email to add yours to the list... but ONLY if it can be controlled over a network.  There is no way I can guarantee that support will ever be added for your brand but I will try.********************If you find this app useful please rate & review it.  Normally I wouldn't say that the more ratings I get the more I will update it, but with a project like this that is pretty much the case.  Low interest means little incentive to improve on it.********************** REQUIREMENTS **1) Working installation of DirecTV Remote+ (Free or Pro)* from Cognitial Mobile.  If you do not have either app installed, you cannot run this app at all!2) An SD card (removable or non-removable) must be installed so that this plugin can retrieve your DirecTV Remote app settings.3) A supported device as listed above.* This plugin app will still allow you create and test volume profiles even if only the free version is installed but please note that they only function from the PRO version of the DirecTV Remote+ app.AGAIN:  MOST people will not be able to control volume from any app due to technological limitations.  This is not my fault and there is nothing I can do about it.  People who can use an app to control volume probably already know this.  If you are not sure, then you probably cannot.Special thanks to:* Laurent Jedeloo (\"OnkyTroller\" developer)* Andreas Pillath (\"AVR-Remote for Denon/Marantz\" developer)* Ed N., David B., Mike W., Kelvin N., Doug R. and MANY OTHERS for helping test the app--------------DirecTV, Remote, Direct, TV, AVR, Satellite, Plugin, Volume--------------",

As long as your HD consoles are set with static IPS you should have no problem scanning and finding all the HD consoles on your network.
