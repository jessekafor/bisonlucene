Turn your phone or tablet into a wireless flash drive with a single tap!Different profiles can be used to quickly choose which folders to share. Assign your home or office Wi-Fi networks to profiles and Droid NAS will auto-select profiles on start.You can additionally share any folder on your device (including external SD cards) or remove unnecessary shares. Just tap and hold on the list of shares.Supported systems:- Mac OS X.- Android: apps like ES File Explorer, Solid Explorer, GTVBox Video Player.  - Windows is NOT supported because it can't connect to SMB servers via a non-standard port. - Linux most probably also won't work. Keywords: SMB, CIFS, Server, file, transfer, download, upload, copy.",

That might be a quirk of the Samsung Galaxy S4, but I had to install a file viewer app on my phone to see what was going on. There is \\\"emulated\\\" storage that I was seeing on my mac via Droid NAS, but I wasn\\'t really seeing the actual SD card.",
