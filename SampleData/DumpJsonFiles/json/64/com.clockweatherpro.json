Will not store locations, and does not know not my location either, useless really, as I can\\'t get ANY weather displayed at all, it just does NOTHING. Other weather programs find my location OK  Wish I hadn\\'t got the paid for Pro version before trying it out now but thought I would buy it straight away as I HATE adverts. I know there were problems like this in earlier versions, but I thought they would have been solved by now as they were 1-4 months ago but it seems developer hasn\\'t solved them. And yes, I have mailed then for support but I don\\'t hold out much hope as previous users with this problem haven\\'t updated their opinions by saying it works now.  The annoying thing really is that it is one of the most expensive programs on here at \\302\\2432.49 and it looks like I will just have to write the money off... not good.   UPDATE ON VERSION 2.1.5pro The app works PEFECTLY now ... so goes from 1 STAR to 5 Stars !!! Brilliant ... Many thanks !",
