    "description": "Conflicts: WW1 Western Front is a huge turn based strategy game which takes place on the Western Front of the First World War.You are in command of the German armed forces - generals, infantry, cavalry, artillery and the first tank units - and the object of the game is to conquer the strategic parts of France as quickly as possible.This is a huge game, and if you haven't played games fom the Conflict-series, you may want to start with Operation Barbarossa or D-Day before taking on the Great War of 1914-1918. If you want to test the game mechanics of Conflict-Series, a LITE version of Operation Barbarossa is available for free.Highlights:+ Tactical Areas/Move Points: Some hexagons are connected together forming slowly evolving Tactical Areas, and you can move between such hexagons using Tactical MPs instead of regular MPs. This opens up a completely new tactical dimension.+ Economy & Production: You decide how to use the industrial resources that you capture: Build railway networks, produce Rail MPs, manufacture minefields, etc.+ Railway Network: To navigate the huge game area efficiently you need to plan where to build railway network.+ Mud: Areas which see lot of troop movement and battles will turn into mud, which might consume extra move points, so you cannot get bogged down on the war of attrition if you want to keep the front lines advancing.+ Generals: Generals support the closest units in battle at the cost of 1 MP, while the front line units located too far away from Generals might lose 1 MP.FEATURES:+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, ability to cross rivers without losing move points, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units (real - NATO), what is drawn on the screen, etc.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.+ Inexpensive: The entire WWI western front for the price of a coffee!In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of World War 1!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (se settings).",

        "comment": "5 start still, but i think worth the major overhaul the artillery is somewhat undervalued now.  Shell production should increase by 1, and Germans need to be able to entrench themselves for rest and refit.  The original artillery seemed to me to give a better balance from my perspective.  I do understand the change and it is somewhat better, but.. Meh, i think things are to fortified vs the Germans.  I\\'ve yet to complete a game.",

        "comment": "It has taken me about three weeks (on and off) to finish this game. I have played just about all of these Conflicts games too. Like the Field Marshals of the day I felt all of the frustrations of static warfare. As one other comment put it \\\"fortress after fortress..\\\". When I finally broke through my cavalry were already dead so back to the battle of attrition. Like the real generals it took many different evolving strategies before I finally won. Without trying to be a spoiler: Where the other Conflict games was about encirclement this one is about supply. You will work it out. Enjoy - I certainly did. JC",
