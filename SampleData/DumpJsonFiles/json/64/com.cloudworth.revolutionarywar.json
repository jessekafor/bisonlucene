    "description": "Conflicts: American Revolutionary War is a turn based strategy game which takes place on the American East Coast.You are in command of the ragtag US armies during the American Revolutionary War 1775-1783. The object of the game is to fight off British forces and control enough cities to be able to claim independence. Events threatening the Colonies include raids by Iroquois warriors, uprisings by royalist units, and Hessians and British forces landing on your shores.Cities provide supply to units, while Plantations provide Gold which is needed for various purchases. New militia units can be formed from Minutemen locations still at your control. Any attacking unit needs to be located nearby a movable Ammo Depot, which can be created from Armories.FEATURES:+ Economy & Production: You decide how to use the meager resources at your disposal: Build roads, form more units, pacify restless elements, upgrade militia to cavalry or regular infantry, etc.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units (real - NATO - web 2.0), custom font and map size, etc.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.To get a sense of how Conflicts: American Revolutionary War works, try out Conflicts: Operation Barbarossa LITE -- http://goo.gl/vLuaP -- which uses the same mechanics as Conflicts: American Revolutionary War.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine whether or not you are connected to the Internet so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (visit settings to turn the feature OFF or alter its behavior).",

Edit:  7/24/13 --- Changes to ARW has greatly improved it.  I\\'ve raised it from 3 stars to 5.  It is still a challenge, but one that I feel is possible to defeat.  Kudos to Joni :-)",

        "comment": "I\\'ve bought/played/won almost all of Joni\\'s games and thought that he wasn\\'t likely to release anything that came close to the intensity of Eastern Front.  In my opinion, this is his best though by some way.  The completely non-linear nature of the game play with no defined front lines and random events such as Indians, Royalist uprisings and the dreaded British fleet landing make for a truly engrossing game.    I\\'ve only played v1.6 but can reassure people that it is beatable - although probably not the first few times you play it.  You need to seriously think about your tactics otherwise you\\'ll just be overwhelmed.  If you\\'re a serious strategy fan then you\\'ll love this.",
