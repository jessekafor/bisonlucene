    "description": "Conflicts: Fall of Normandy is a turn based strategy game which takes place on the western front during the Second World War immediately after the D-Day invasion on June 6th 1944.You are in command of the German armed forces and you are tasked with stopping the Allied invasion by eliminating all landing beaches in Normandy - while enduring the constant Allied bombardment limiting your mobility. Troops at your disposal range from the fragile Ost battalions to the battle-hardened Waffen SS divisions and Panzer VI formations.FEATURES:+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: difficulty levels, what to draw on the map, custom font and map size.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defence performance, ability to cross rivers without losing extra move points.+ A wide variety of units under your command: From weak coastal fortifications, Ost battalions and static infantry units to battle-hardened Waffen SS and Panzer divisions (from Panzer IV to Panzer VI Tigers).+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup of the real 1944 Normandy landings - including the divisions that saw combat during the D-Day and the following Normandy Campaign in World War II.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.In order to be a victorious general, it is essential that you learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.To get a sense of how Conflicts: Fall of Normandy works, try out Operation Barbarossa LITE -- http://bit.ly/GVaC8a -- which uses the same mechanics as Conflicts: Fall of Normandy.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in turning the tide of the Second World War!The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (see settings).",

        "comment": "I think it\\'s well established by now that the Conflicts series is a must for any wargamer with an Android - and this is a great place to start. Not too big and not too difficult, this game clearly favors the German side, but still provides a challenging experience. Addictive and easy to learn, this is a scenario where you\\'ll learn to win not by sheer numbers, but by outmaneuvering your enemy, combining your forces and keeping adequate reserves.",

        "comment": "Joni\\'s games are really pioneering efforts in bringing true historic chit shuffling wargames to the handheld gaming devices. Blazing a trail into many different conflicts through many different eras, he has shown his wargaming engine is more than capable, to bring history soaked entertainment to mobile wargamers. Fall of Normandy is a great introduction to his engine, where very simple user mechanics can build upon one another to form a deep wargaming experience.",

Should also add some allies commandos paratroopers units of strenght 1, for defense, and strenght 2 for light offensives. Could also add some naval bombardement effect if landing is failing after a few rounds.",
