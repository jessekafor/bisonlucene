The only way I would improve it is by keeping the favourites icon on screen at all times in stead of having to enter a phrase section first to access them,  I\\'d also like to see a slow down repeat option of the phrase, word for word,  so you can practice the phrase in sections. Apart from that,  brilliant!",
