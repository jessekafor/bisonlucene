        "comment": "I was looking for a way to save on my prepaid phone, and this app helps me save more than from paying taxes at stores like Walgreens and CVS. It also gives discount, so I save myself (and my boyfriend) at least $1 every month I refill. The only thing that throws me off is having to call for verification EVERY time I make the purchase. That should be changed.",

        "comment": "I was happy to get this app.  What a great way to rapidly refill my Boost Mobile account.  I took no issue with entering the credit card first, and the prices are what you would normally find on refill accounts.  I tried a $20 to test the app and the refill, then the disappointment.  I had to call them to verify the order.  If I already have the phone in hand, and the last 4 digits of the credit card are showing on the screen, what other info are you looking for?  So I called and verified, and it went through properly.  Can\\'t this be done without the verification?  All this being said, I still like the app.  Much handier than a store and / or a pin to deal with.  It would also be nice to have a pin on the app for security purposes.",
