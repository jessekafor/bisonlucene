Please report any crashes/problems via email (include your device name and android version). I cannot answer the comments and will update the app ASAP.Hi guys,If you encounter a problem like \"when I run and press A or B it wont let me use either button until I stop running\". And if you make sure your phone can support multi-touch,please send me an email about your device name, type, android version and the game name.Thanks!",
