    "description": "Conflicts: Rommel and Afrika Korps is a turn based strategy game which takes place in the North African theater during the Second World War.After the Italian forces collapse in the North Africa, German HQ sends in some German reinforcements - led by the famous Desert Fox Erwin Rommel. Soon German Africa Corps (known in Germany as Deutsches Afrikakorps, or DAK) springs from assumed defensive setup to a lighting fast attack across the barren area, and in spite of serious supply challenges, Rommel manages to threaten the British strongholds of Cairo and Alexandria. Can you do better?If you want to test the game mechanics of Rommel and Afrika Korps, a 20-turn DEMO version of Rommel & Afrika Korps is available for free. http://bit.ly/17cnu8RFEATURES:+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup, including some of the related events, as Operation Flipper, Bardia Raid, sand storms, less than perfect collaboration with Italian troops.+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, etc.+ Settings: Various settings to alter the look of the gaming experience: different icon sets for units, what to draw on map, etc.+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.+ Inexpensive: The classic WW2 strategy game campaign for the price of a coffee!Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of World War II!Supply Rules: To keep your armored and motorized divisions on the move you must use Fuel Trucks to transport fuel from Fuel Depots to front line units. Fuel Depots can be refueled only from El Agheila (unlimited amount) or Tobruk (limited amount). Meanwhile only El Agheila and Benghazi provide food supply, so units must have a route to either of these cities after the British forces have moved.Tactical Areas/Move Points: Some hexagons are connected together (via green lines) forming slowly evolving Tactical Areas, and you can move between such hexagons using Tactical MPs instead of regular MPs. This opens up a completely new tactical dimension.How to Win: In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.The list below includes the permissions requested and the reasons for their use.+ Internet: To fetch Hall of Fame data from a server.+ Network State: To determine if you are online so the game doesn't crash while trying to connect.+ Control Vibrator: To vibrate the phone during the battles (see settings).",

        "comment": "There are no frills here, just a solid classic wargame that harkens back to the days of SPI and Avalon Hill.  You are Rommel, battling the AI CW all the way to Cairo.  The AI gives a credible performance - the aggressiveness of its units is tempered somewhat by their proclivity put themselves out of supply.  You do spend a fair amount of time moving supply trucks around, but that\\'s war in the desert for you.    Fuel powers everything, and British commandos and raiders can make you hit the new game button in a hurry as you watch your depots burn.  There is no save game or undo function, so your decisions are final.  I wish the terrain graphics were better, but at least there are plenty of options.  Some kind of basic sounds would be nice too, and better documentation.  Still, 5 stars for one of the best wargames on Android.",

        "comment": "For the strategy game player these games are quite good and in many ways seem to play out like the real campaign. A couple of suggestions: 1. Add an option to \\\"send\\\" a unit to a point on the map (within controlled territory) such as supply trucks and fuel depots. That way you don\\'t have to play them every turn if they are simply going back over controlled territory for replenishment and return. Playing each unit every turn gets cumbersome when the unit must travel from Tobruk to Alexandria. 2. Air Recon option for air units. to find enemy units. 3. Let units arrive at Tobruk after port is captured. 4. Possibly let an out of fuel tank unit set up a static defense with bunker options.  Finally, one small bug I\\'ve found is that if an armor unit runs out of fuel and attack points it seems to be able to hold off allied infantry units of far superior strength. Each turn it loses the battle and you can see \\\"retreat command\\\" but the unit stays and isn\\'t destroyed. I discovered this accidentally on my second game when a unit got caught out in the desert. I placed 2 mine fields, one on either side, and held off the whole Brit Army in this area until I got a fuel truck there. Jim",

With a ruthless AI, a fragile supply system, and plenty of semi-scripted surprises (most of them ruining your plans), it\\'s challenging and will force you to think and rethink your strategy. Even on normal difficulty, the mid-game is tough. Sooner or later, you will face a decisive battle against an enemy that outnumbers you. Win it, and you will roll over the rest of Monty\\'s forces with ease. Lose it, and watch your war collapse.",
