We have created several worlds for each kid to explore including the Farm, the Ocean and Dinosaur world!Your child can learn new words, shapes and spelling. Clever Kids First Puzzles is both educational and loads of fun! You can drag the pieces of each puzzle around to create a picture and fill in the animals that inhabit each scene. The app will also help your child spell out each word.We designed this app with our own children who gave us essential (and sometimes quite critical!) feedback. They love the final app though and we hope your kids will love it too :)Designed for:Kids games for 2 years oldKids games for 3 years oldKids games for 4 years old",

        "comment": "My child really likes the app. I like the extra balloons to pop in the main screens. I do not like the More Games, Parents Page, and links to their other games on the main page when trying to pop balloons. Those should all be tied inside one link, like as a part of the settings icon in the top right hand corner. I also really don\\'t like paying for an app and having them collect my device and mobile network info through AdKnowledge. Could also use some new puzzles... Without the links and privacy issues it would absolutely be able 5",

        "comment": "Don\\'t get me wrong, my son really likes this, but come on guys... a tortoise does not live in the sea, that\\'s the turtle. A triceratops should have three horns, not two, it\\'s all in the name.  Some dinosaur names are said correctly by the speaker, but not spelt correctly. Parasaurolophus is pronounced corrected but missing the first \\'a\\' in the written form.  All perhaps unnoticeable to kids but it\\'s meant to be educating them :-)",
