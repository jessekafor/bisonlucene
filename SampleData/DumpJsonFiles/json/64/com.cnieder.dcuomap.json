        "comment": "There are many other maps that would be awesome if you could put on here, alerts, raids and such. There are also new DLC\\'s that come with there own Briefings, including the Audio Tour, and Deathstroke\\'s Contacts. I\\'ve used this and it works great, but it just great in the current condition it could be so much better with the above mentioned things plus bounties, and cc bounties. *Idea* Maybe you could make another app that had the details and locations of all the armor pieces and other such items",
