        "comment": "Can\\'t toggle traditional symbols. Volume isn\\'t maximized - some sounds are loud and some are quite. Quiz mode doesn\\'t support hiding Chinese instead of English. Can\\'t change how many times the sounds are repeated - you\\'re forced to hear it 3 times with a pause even after English. You can only play 1 category at a time and words always come in same sequence. Considering these things, Pro version is really overpriced.",

You can even test yourself before tapping the screen for the answer.  The text is clear to read, the background graphics add emphasis and look really nice. The developers are fast to reply emails, sort bugs and updates.  So I rate this program 5 stars. I hope you like it too. :)",
