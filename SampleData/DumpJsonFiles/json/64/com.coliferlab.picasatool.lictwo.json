        "comment": "I just purchased this app since i like using the picasa tool for my pictures, but it wouldnt allow me to upload any videos longer than 10 seconds so I purchased the $6.99 premium where it says you can download videos > 10 seconds, but it doesnt tell you the video has to be less than 1 minute. according to the videos that I have recorded and am trying to upload it wont let me I get a prompt saying only videos less than 100 MB are allowed, which is 1 min of recording. I then tried to contact the email address that is listed for a refund, so I sent them a email, then I looked at my email at my receipt showing my purchase then read the refund policy that you have 15 minutes from the time you purchase it to return it, so when I was reading that it showed it was sent exactly 15 minutes form the time I bought it, so I tried to quickly find the app on my phone and click refund but as I did it, it changed from refund to uninstall. I have emailed the address that was on the bottom of my receipt and explain to them what has happened. We will see if I get any reply back. I will change the rating once this issue is resolved!",

A seven dollar app can\\'t do what I can just use Google+ for.  I want my money back.",

        "comment": "this is a good app, easy to use. there are several ways to download Google Plus albums on Android devices, for instance, using Web browser. but I paid for this app because it makes download easier. one big enhancement for the app from my point of view is to enable download offline albums with original size photos, and keep the file names and EXIF info as online. currently the max setting for offline photo size is 1280, good enough for a mobile phone, but not for pads with HD screens. then the file names are changed to random numbers and EXIF info gets lost. when do you think this feature can be implemented in a future version?",
