Please add Google+ sign-in api as I\\'m using Facebook less and less. Its a very intrusive system. Apart f on that, graphics, story and cut scenes are of the best quality!! Cheers",

        "comment": "=Summary= If you have root on your device, take the time to map some touch controls to your Moga or PS3 controller using Sixaxis or USB/BT Joy Center. Once Digital Reality implement native hardware controller support and give players back the screen real-estate they are missing, this game will be unbeatable in the shmup category.  =Long Version= So I\\'ve tried all different control types now before writing this, and I have to say that probably the best out of the wretched bunch is Relative Touch. At least that way you can move the ship around the screen with a stylus instead of having to try and use the horrible virtual d-pad. Not to mention the weapon controls are arranged in a lineal arrangement which means your thumb often slips off the fire button. This game requires such precision in control to thread your way through bullet hell that anything less than a hardware joypad is going to mean you are \\\"going to have a bad time\\\". I\\'m finding that even though Sine Mora has staggering graphics, I\\'m drawn more towards Xelorians because that developer has *nailed* the controls on that game.  Digital Reality could do well to take a look at that app\\'s control system.",
