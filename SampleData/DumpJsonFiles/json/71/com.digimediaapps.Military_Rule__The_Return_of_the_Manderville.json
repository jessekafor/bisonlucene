    "description": "A writer uses his imagination to create intriguing characters and a gripping storyline, and author Mark had achieved this in creating his debut novel, Military Rule. But the boundary between imagination and reality is challenged beyond all belief when a character supposedly killed off in his book rises like a phoenix from the ashes: General Mandeville - no longer MarkÎÃÃs creation but now completely beyond his control and his own, even more dangerous being, determined to be the LordÎÃÃs Second Coming and establish military rule on Earth under his command.Mandeville has become the voice of Seeker One - formerly part of a covert long-term US military operation for gathering intelligence via infiltration of worldwide computer networks - two years ahead of MarkÎÃÃs time, his aim to control MarkÎÃÃs here and now and determine the future by revisiting the past and installing virtual beings on Earth - multiple selves of their human counterparts hooked up to terminals on Seeker One - to create confusion and influence humansÎÃÃ thoughts and beliefs in his favour. Suddenly author/character roles appear to have become reversed and Mark finds himself caught between two factions - the white-eyed of MandevilleÎÃÃs Network and the red-eyed splinter group - representing the Lord and Allah respectively, each trying to influence MarkÎÃÃs imagination of the truth and represent their own version of the book of revelations to humankind. MarkÎÃÃs choices are no longer those of the author of a work of fiction: the path he takes now will literally determine the future of the world.Please Note that the book is stored on your phone and you do NOT need a data connection to read it.This is a full-length, quality digitized book.Military Rule: The Return of the Manderville, by Mark S.
