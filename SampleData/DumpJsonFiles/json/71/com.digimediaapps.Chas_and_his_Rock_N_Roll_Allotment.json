    "description": "Chas and His Rock n Roll Allotment is a gardening book like no other. Written by Chas Hodges, better known as half of musical duo Chas and Dave, the book is full of funny stories and anecdotes interspersed with the author's tips for growing your own. The book is aimed at the novice gardener and aims to prove that hoeing and sowing can be an enjoyable way to while away an afternoon and that tending a garden should be fun, rather than a chore. Chas's pearls of wisdom are drawn from personal experience of getting his hands dirty, rather than text book gardening techniques, and his light hearted approach makes the book an easy read. So if the idea of Sunday roast accompanied by your own home grown vegetables appeals to you, this book tells you how. And if all that digging proves to be just too much, you can always settle down with a pint of beer and enjoy the tongue-in-cheek humour of a born raconteur.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
