    "description": "A profound insight to the greatest test we all face: to be beside someone we love - a parent, a partner, a child â as they slip away from us. Grace Sheppard draws on the experience of caring for her dying husband, David Sheppard, England cricket captain and later Bishop of Liverpool.  She looks at what drives us to run away from the difficult times and emotions.  The key to Living with Dying is friendship.  Whether you are someone with little or no faith, Living with Dying will help you see that looking for God in an expectant sense, and developing an intimate relationship with him makes a positive difference to the supply of energy and hope in caring.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
