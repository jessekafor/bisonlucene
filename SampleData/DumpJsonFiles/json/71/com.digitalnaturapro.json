When I try to change the properties of a sequence within a script it either erases everything in the sequence or deletes the sequence entirely. I lost 3 hours worth of work just because I wanted to change the name of the sequence. Other than that I love it though. I will give it 5 stars when this glitch is dressed. I change things all the time and this makes me not even want to start writing something because I\\'m afraid ill want to change it later...",

Sometimes it\\'s a little hard to figure out where to click for what I\\'m looking for. I also wish the title page would have more flexible options, and to be set as its own page, rather than being placed at the top of the page where the script actually begins.",
