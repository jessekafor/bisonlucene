Suddenly thereâs a camera crew tracking her every move and Laura finds herself an unlikely star. Wined, dined, and pampered, she begins to see the charms of a younger partner herself. But as things hot up between her and gorgeous TV director, Cal, theyâre going downhill elsewhere. While Lauraâs caught up in a heady whirlwind of beauty treatments, makeovers and glamorous film locations, Charlotteâs husband, Roger, is concealing a guilty secret, Stanleyâs got problems at school, workâs piling up, and when Laura turns detective to protect Charlotteâs marriage, things go horribly wrong.The champagneâs flowing as Lauraâs prime time TV debut looks set to be a hit.
