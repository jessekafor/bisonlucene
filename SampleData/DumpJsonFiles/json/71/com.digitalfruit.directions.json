    "description": "Find out which are Your four best (and worst) directions for sleeping, reading, studying. Good Directions selection is based on your Kua number, which is determined by your year of birth and gender. Using this app as a compass, you can quickly find out favorable and less favorable directions for you and for your partner simultaneously.Eight House Feng Shui also named Eight Mansions Feng Shui is one of the easier and more popular methods used to determine the good and bad locations of a dwelling, to analyse whether you are compatible with the house and to find out your favourable and unfavourable personal directions that promote productivity at work and in relationships, foster good health and successful academic pursuits. There are many aspects to Eight House Feng Shui which has sophisticated formulae for recognising sha (dangerous) qi (Châi) from any given direction, observing bad land structure in specific location based on the house trigram and Eight House Water Method to name but a few. The easiest form is calculating your own Life Gua number according to the year you are born thus identifying your four favourable and four unfavourable directions. Just enter your (and your partner's) birth dates and gender and you are ready to go.Note: If your phone does not show the right directions phone compas may need calibration. Just wave the phone several times in a 8-shape figure in the air and compass should start show correct readings.",
