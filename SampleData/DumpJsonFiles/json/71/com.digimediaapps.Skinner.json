    "description": "John Skinner is a man on the edge. Blotting out his loneliness with work and booze, he's spiralling out of control. Strange thoughts and obsessions are starting to possess his mind, and the line between fantasy and reality is becoming increasingly blurred. As he clings to the edge of the precipice from which there is no return, he has one last chance to step back from the brink, but with a broken family and marriage behind him, what is there to go back to? Slipping deeper into psychosis, his life takes a sinister twist. Unsure who to trust apart from the voices in his head, and with the promise of release from his mental torture, he embarks on a mission from God - a mission to kill.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
