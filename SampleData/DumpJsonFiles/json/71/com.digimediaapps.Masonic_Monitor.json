    "description": "The Author-This Monitor has been prepared in obedience to that resolution. The book is the child of my heart and mind. A love for the cause inspired its preparation. It goes to the craft with my earnest prayers that it may cause a more general and closer study of the beautiful ceremonies of the first three degrees, which are the foundation of all true Freemasonry. I dedicate the book to the Masons of Arkansas, who have so often and so kindly honored me above my merit.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
