    "description": "Published to coincide with the centenary of the Houndsditch Murders in December 2010, A Storm in the Blood tells the story of the Latvian revolutionaries who killed three officers of the Metropolitan Police. The parallel between the suicide ideologues of the time and contemporary terrorists, willing to die for their ideals, is all too clear. One of the most sensational crimes of the era, the murders were followed by the `Siege of Sidney Street', a gunfight that saw then-Home Secretary Winston Churchill sending troops into the streets of London.  A siege and shoot-out in Sherlock Holmes' London after an anarchist robbery gone wrong foreshadows Jerusalem 1947, Manhattan 2001, and Baghdad today. A Storm in the Blood slams home the revolutionary realities of lust, violence, anger and appetite. 'Jon Stephen Fink is the Tarantino of Terrorism.' --John Baxter, Author of the biographies \"Kubrick\", \"George Lucas\" and many others",
