        "comment": "We saw the great DioGuardi billboards around with the App mentioned.. What a great idea. Being able to connect to your account while being mobile! The scanning of the documents is a great feature as is the updates on the Video and Blog area. The FIND A LOCATION works very well and it\\'s easy to find the closest office. I am sure I will be using this while out at the Restaurants after my bill comes in.",
