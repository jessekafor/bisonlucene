        "comment": "The closest anyone has come to making a good slender game so far, but not scary at all. The way he pops out at you is not scary, its like \\\"oh, he\\'s there\\\", and when you die, its not scary. He doesn\\'t even get close to you. It\\'s a good app, but keep working on it, and it\\'ll be great.",
