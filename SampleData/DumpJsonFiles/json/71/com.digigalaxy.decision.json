    "description": "Intelligent Decision will help you to decide.The answer to your question should be either yes or no in order for the app to correctly calculate the right decision for you.There is obviously no \"one decision\" to your question, and hence the answer is given with a confidence level which will provide you with the more likely answer and obviously at the end the decision is entirely yours.Intelligent Decision requires an internet connection if you have an android version that is less than 4.1 (Jelly Bean). This is for the voice recognition, which allows you to easily complete the process of making a decision.However if you have android version 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or above, you can use this app without connecting to the internet, by using Android's new offline voice recognition feature. To enable this feature, follow the instructions here:http://goo.gl/4KGgD",
