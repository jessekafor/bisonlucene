    "description": "This beautiful book, which may be used as a daily devotional through Lent or any other period of the year, reopens Kenneth Grahameâs classic childrenâs novel The Wind in the Willows for a new audience. Combining a daily reading from the literary classic with a gospel passage, a short meditation by Leslie Francis and a prayer, The Gospel in the Willows takes us on a journey through the Christian life, exploring themes such asThe Call, Shaking the Dust, Finding Acceptance, Divided Loyalties, Real Repentance, Facing Temptation, The Lost Son and Accepting Release.The much-loved characters of Mole, Rat and Toad become the perfect allegory for the grand adventure of faith, from our terrifying first steps into and beyond the riverbank, to the challenges, temptations and triumphs that await us as we journey into the world, with Jesus by our side.This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***           *** NO ADVERTS! ***           *** FULL LENGTH BOOKS ***This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
