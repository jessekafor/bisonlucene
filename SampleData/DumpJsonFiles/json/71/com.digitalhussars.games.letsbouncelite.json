    "description": "Let's bounce is not a typical arkanoid style game. Try something fresh!Every level, in contrast to other breakout games, is randomly generated, but not only the bricks arrangement is random. On each level there is different selection of difficulties what makes every next stage more difficult than previous one. All of this guarantee that number of combinations is unlimited and every game is different. If you enjoy that kind of games but you are looking for something innovative, you've just found it! You should try to control two, three or even four paddles in places when usually there are only walls. Imagine one ball, dozens of blocks, lots of drops and you controlling four paddles simultaneously.- Control up to four paddles simultaneously using accelerometer.- Play infinitely number of different levels- 9 totally different difficulties makes every your game unique- Random bricks arrangement- Every next level is more difficult than the previous one, but the selection of difficulties almost never is the sameClick ads to support us. Thank You.",
