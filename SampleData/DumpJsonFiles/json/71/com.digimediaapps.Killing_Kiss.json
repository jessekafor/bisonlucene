    "description": "He's looking for a girl; not just any girl, and dark-haired, brown-eyed Carolyn is the one. But does Gabriele Caccini, a student at Manchester University, really know what he wants? When a beautiful, curvacious blonde comes into his life he starts to question his motives and emotions; even a seventeenth century vampire can do that. Alone in the modern world, limiting his feeds to one a year to avoid detection, Gabriele reflects on the origins of his immortality and questions why it is he who should have the vampire gene, when over 400 women have not survived his killing kiss ... But at a house party, a fellow student spikes Gabriele's drink with drugs and his self indulgent musings are suddenly turned upside down ...",
