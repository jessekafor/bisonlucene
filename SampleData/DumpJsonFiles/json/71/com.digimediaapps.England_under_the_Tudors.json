    "description": "The Tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603, in relation to the history of England. This coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (1457-1509).This period was full of intrigue with characters to match and formed much of Britain as it is today especially in religion. Arthur D. Innes looks at the life of the people during this period.",
