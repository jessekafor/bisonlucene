Sometimes the ingredients will display for a fraction of a second and then the screen goes back to being blank and blue. What the hell happened? Why does this keep happening!? If I click on the screen in certain areas it will show another page giving a definition of the item I apparently hit. But when I go back it is a blank screen. Fix this issue and put in proper measurements! The classic drinks are all fucked up.",

I would like to see more options for customization, again a great start is the custom drinks options, however, some of the recipes I\\'ve had need ingredients that aren\\'t on the lists of them (like Iced Cake vodka, blackberry syrup, moonshine), it would be nice to be able to add custom ingredients. Even better if you can add you\\'re own descriptions of them.   That\\'s just one quip I have about the app; though, like I said, it\\'s a great start for this app",
