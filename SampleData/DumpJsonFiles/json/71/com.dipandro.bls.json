    "description": "This application sends the canned SMS text to the recipient when your phone battery gets low.If you are wondering - Why would I ever need to inform \"my\" phone battery level to \"anyone\" ?Well.. there are numerous reasons viz.Use cases: # When you want to intimate your dear ones that they shouldn't worry if your phone is not reachable- as your phone battery is getting down. May want to indicate your alternate number/ friend's name in the message.\te.g Hi Dad, my phone might run out of battery in sometime, I am with my basketball team celebrating today's victory in pool. Phone's not in my pocket ofcourse ;).# When your elder ones forget to charge their android smart phones, then configure this app to inform yourself whenever their phone battery gets low.\te.g Autotext: Me to myself ! Its time to be at the helm to put on charge Mom's phone !!Mail me if you make use of it in any other better way - you get the credit!Q: Why this app does not allow me to select the battery percentage at which SMS should be sent ?A: To send message at a user selected level, the application will then require to constantly process at each battery level change for the match- which eventually drains more battery as a side-effect.Thus to avoid this battery sapping, this app simply sits idle until Android itself declares a low battery state, which is generally 15% - a source code configurable value set by your phone manufacturer stock/ custom rom developer.Q: Why this app does not start automatically on phone boot?A: IMHO any app which involves direct cost to the end-user (e.g SMS charges) should first acquire consent explicity before operating - nothing should be sneaky !",
