    "description": "Greg wakes up in a remote war zone, sole survivor of an air crash caused by a suicide bomber. Aman faces the disappearance of his wife and children in a family blood feud. Samira is forced to cope with the complexities of life as an asylum-seeker in the UK. Nuala must deal with the news that her husband is missing, presumed dead, victim of a terrorist atrocity. Divinity Road, Martin Pevsner's first novel, traces the lives of four individuals and the unexpected links that bind them together. From violent conflict in Africa to the suburban streets of Oxford, it evokes a world of alienation and separation, fanaticism and cruelty, but ultimately celebrates the power of human solidarity and resilience.",
