    "description": "'Goodbye, little Emily.'  April 1938, and a shadowy figure attends an impromptu burial in Shoreditch, London. His name is HonorÃ© Lechasseur. After a chance encounter with the mysterious Catherine Howkins, he's had advance warning that his friend Emily Blandish was going to die. But is forewarned necessarily forearmed? And just how far is he willing to go to save Emily's life?  Because HonorÃ© isn't the only person taking an interest in Emily Blandish - she's come to the attention of the Albino, one of the new breed of gangsters surfacing in post-rationing London. And the only life he cares about is his own.  Part mystery, part detective story, part dark fantasy, part science fiction... original adventures in time and space.This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***           *** NO ADVERTS! ***           *** FULL LENGTH BOOKS ***This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
