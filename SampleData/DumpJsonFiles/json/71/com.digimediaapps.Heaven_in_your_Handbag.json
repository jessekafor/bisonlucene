    "description": "Christian women. If images of the Womenâs Institute, tweed and coffee mornings spring to mind, then itâs time to think again.  Parties, men, careers, friends â life can be pretty demanding for the modern woman. But what if youâre Christian too â or at least a little bit curious about this âGodâ figure you hear so much about? Surely you canât have a fun Saturday night and turn up to church the following morning as well?  Religion just doesnât fit into a modern girlâs life, right?  As effervescent as chilled champagne and as comforting as a tray of Belgian chocolates â welcome to Heaven in Your Handbag, a whole new take on Christianity for the hard-working, dance all night but still morally upright chick about town.  Mazzi Binaisa, who admits to being partial to both of the above, takes you through the typical challenges modern women face in four snappy and savvy chapters: You, Love, Work, and Friends.  Mazzi mixes vivid testimonies, surprising new angles on familiar biblical texts, along with smart advice on how to escape the disaster date.  And she shares her greatest discovery â that we are all invited to enjoy a love affair that is richer and more fulfilling and fun than any other.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
