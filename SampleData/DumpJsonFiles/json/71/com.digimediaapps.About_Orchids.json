    "description": "About Orchids by Frederick Boyle. These essays profess to be no more than chat of a literary man about orchids. They contain a multitude of facts, told in some detail where such attention seems necessary, which can only be found elsewhere in baldest outline if found at all. All in all a great book about this most exotic of flowers.'",
