        "comment": "...I took the game cause i wanted to have a step back in the past....well i had it not because i enjoyed once more this beautiful game but because i have to deal with crappy installation process...after 3 days i am still unable to play the game. The APK installs correctly but when i tries to retrieve the rest of it (600+mb) it suddenly stops (and it is not the network i tried on different ones) at 20/30% of the process...i tried everything possible: removing and installing it again, deleting cashes...i am now exploring the possibility to get the \\\"cache\\\" from different sources, but doing so i not only have to open my device to harmful software but it looks like it does not even work either!!!!  If you luck (as many below have been) you will be able to enjoy it...but if something happens you might just end up like me (and others below)...  Should we try to do something or you want us all to look for \\\"alternative\\\" sources?",

The first one I saw was a prototype and the manufacturer, Cinematronics, had people there watching people play the game.  The game got moved to the arcade at University Town Center in La Jolla. It was there where I was the first person to beat the game.  Someone from Cinematronics was there and I got invited to tour the factory.  That version did not have the modes. It was just hard. This brings back some great memories. Thanks!",
