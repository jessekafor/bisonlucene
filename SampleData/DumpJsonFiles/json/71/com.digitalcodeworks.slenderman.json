        "comment": "This game is awesome and I really like it. although there are a few flaws: 1. Please add more stages to choose from and more conditions like night vision and stormy night. A few examples of stages you could have are: mansion or a mental hospital or a prison and a haunted forest or a desolate town. 2. This game is a bit too easy. Try making him a bit creepier and make easy mode tougher because even on hard I don\\'t get much of a challenge. Although I do like how challenging it is to find each sign.",

I have it three stars but I would like to see a slender man open world mystery story type game.",
