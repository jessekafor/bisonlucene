With thirty-two chapters covering a range of subjects from fitness to body language to eye contact, this book is not your run-of-the-mill martial arts manual.  It is written by self-defence expert and 6th Dan Tom Hill, and those with an interest in the mental techniques of attack and defence will no doubt enjoy it greatly.",
