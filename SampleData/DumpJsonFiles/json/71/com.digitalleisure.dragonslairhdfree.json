This game is a an exercise in mere mindless pressing buttons with no reward of the visuals. Too bad I really used to like this game.",

Why not put the clue flashes back in the video like the original game, remove the on screen controls and use gesture controls instead?  Swipe the screen up, down, left or right for direction.  Tap the screen for sword.    Then you could watch the video as you play and not worry so much about the controls.",
