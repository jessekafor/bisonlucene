        "comment": "What a fantastic app. In Trinidad and Tobago we pray to the different forms of god (in Hinduism) and this app encompasses all whom we worship. I love that they have launched it just in time for Navratri.  I only wish that we could perform aarti in the app itself....maybe in a later version. I also have the Diwali Deeya app by the same developers and this is just great as Diwali is approaching. Keep up the great work!",

        "comment": "I tried the Diwali Deeya app last year and now this one surely surprised me. I like the concept in that you still have that similar interaction with the Deeya but now you can really use this all year round by changing the God and listening to their given mantras. I know there are more Hindu Gods but they seem to cover the major ones. I wish they included Lord Satyanarayana.  I\\'m still having slight issues with respect to swiping to change the Gods but you also have a feature to do this in the menubar as well.",
