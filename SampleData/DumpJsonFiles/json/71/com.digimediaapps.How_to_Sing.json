    "description": "Miss Lehmann was born in Germany in 1848 and went on to become a soprano of phenomenal versatility and in later years a voice teacher of much acclaim.Miss Lehmann sung her way around europe appearing in most of the leading opera houses, her voice was her passport.Looking at her presence on the cover it is no surprise that she was one of the greatest Wagnerian singers of her day.In 1916 Miss Lehmann hung up her breast plate and founded the International Summer Academy in Salzburg that focused on voice lessons and coached many up and coming opera stars.The great thing about ebooks is that it brings back to life forgotten books and their authors that would normally be lost in the mists of time. Miss Lehmann's talent should not be restricted to a print run, it deserves to used by all future generations.The purpose of this book is to teach you how to sing by making best use of your gifts from nature and adding to it with style and technique. In 1902 singers never had the amplification that is available today, they relied on their voice and acoustics, just imagine what these Diva's would sound like today.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
