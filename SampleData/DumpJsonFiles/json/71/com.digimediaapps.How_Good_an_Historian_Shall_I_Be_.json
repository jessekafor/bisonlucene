    "description": "R.G. Collingwoodâs name is familiar to historians and history educators around the world. Few, however, have charted the depths of his reflections on what it means to be educated in history. In this book Marnie Hughes-Warrington begins with the facet of Collingwoodâs work best known to teachersâre-enactmentâand locates it in historically-informed discussions on empathy, imagination and history education.
