    "description": "This application enables you to protect your photos which will then be encrypted and will disappear from the gallery of images (and from any other image viewer).Many options are available (some even allow you to pretend that this is a simple calculator).If you uninstall and reinstall the app, your protected photos won't be lost anymore. Indeed, the application can retrieve protected files (as long as you have the password used when put under protection) even if you clear data from the application inadvertently.If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us by e-mail or directly from the application interface.",
