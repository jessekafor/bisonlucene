    "description": "A Girl Called Jake draws on a translation from a hitherto secret archive to tell the story of a gigantic narcotics plant thatâs built upon a mighty bog.  But in a strange and distant land, a rising for liberty is crushed with vicious and unparalleled violence.  And in the country of the bookâs principal action an agitation grows - and grows.  For here too is a disturbing spirit of national sentiment.  And here too a rising  - a strictly unconstitutional affair!!! - takes place. So in the giant plant is fought once more one of the great battles of classical antiquity.  But in the very moment of victory - defeat!  For just as the copsâ big bust gets under way -  the whole plant tilts and flips, and sinks forever in its mighty bog: and everything goes back to the good old way that it was.  With an introduction: and, by the translator, an afterword.",
