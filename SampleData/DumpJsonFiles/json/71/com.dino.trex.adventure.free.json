U can\\'t get the app unless u agree to let their 3rd party sponser to access ya info. The story shud be read out to the child and the colouring book pic is far to lil and doesn\\'t give a option to change colour. Waste of time",

Using the word dinosaur as a lure and using our $200-300 smart phones, that cost us thousands once the yearly cycle of monthly charges is complete.  They make deals with 3rd party developers that can air push malware within free games offered, unbeknown to this developer. Our devices slow because of air push ads. If Goggle bought our devices it might be tolerable but they use the info gathered for their search engine and encourage it",
