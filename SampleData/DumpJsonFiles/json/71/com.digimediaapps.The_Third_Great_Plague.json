    "description": "Fascinating tale of man's battle with disease. More dramatic than any novel, more sombre and terrifying than a battle fought in the dark, is the intimate picture of the battle of our bodies against the hosts of disease. In this case the disease is the syphilis bacterium. The third great plague is just dawning upon usâa disease which in four centuries has already cost a whole inferno of human misery and a heaven of human happiness.",
