    "description": "Lifer Charlie Bronson's reputation precedes him - 'Britain's most violent prisoner' - or does it? Do we really know the true Charlie, or are our impressions the result of media hype? Well, what is in no doubt is that Loonyology is 200% Bronson and will transport the reader on the dizziest no-holds-barred roller-coaster ride of their lives, from suspense and shock to laughter and tears, and from Bronson the 'Solitary King' to Bronson the Philosopher, the Poet, the Artist, the Author, the Joker, the Walking Scar and the Freedom Fighter.  Now 55 years old, and having spent most of his last 34 years as a maximum security 'Bronco Zoo' inmate, he's a much wiser man as he looks back on his crazy journey of unpredictable behaviour, his ever-alert mind darting from reminiscences of his teenage years to memories of fellow-cons, the screws, the cranks, letters and news reports, prison life and procedures, and the overall madness ('loonyology') of the legal and penal systems, peppering his stories with diary entries, true gems of information, sound advice and hilarious one-liners.  Together with his many supporters and with the aid of a top lawyer, Charlie is campaigning for the parole board to finally allow him his freedom, but begging is not his style: he calls a spade a spade and is determined to win with dignity, fighting with his pen and his brain to achieve his aim of a life outside 'the cage'. In his words: 'I chose to be a villain. I'm not proud of it, nor am I ashamed of it. I have paid my debt to society and it's time to go home.'           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
