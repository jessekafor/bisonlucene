    "description": "The first book to present Girardâs work to a wider audience, showing its impact on theology and other disciplines. The work of RenÃ© Girard is hugely influential in literature and cultural studies. But it is in understanding the relationship between religion and violence that his theories have created the greatest impact. Girardâs understanding of mimetic rivalry and conflict and of scapegoating are seen by many to be keys to a completely new understanding of Christianity. Girardâs name evokes curiosity and â often â strong feelings amongst devotees and sceptics. Discovering Girard is the first book to present Girardâs work to a wider audience in a lively way that not only unpacks and appraises his work and shows its impact on theology and other disciplines but conveys the sense of excitement that a discovery of Girardâs ideas often generates in readers.",
