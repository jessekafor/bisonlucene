        "title": "A good start, but room for improvement",
        "comment": "Whilst this app has some good information, it is significantly lacking in a few very important areas.  I particularly liked the buoyage - being able to visually observe the light characteristics of buoys and their placement within a channel. The day/night toggle is a good idea too, though I\\'m doubtful of the developer\\'s interpretation of the timing of lights (see NP 735).  However, some of the information is wrong. The developer should work in conjunction with an experienced Master to resolve the issues.",
