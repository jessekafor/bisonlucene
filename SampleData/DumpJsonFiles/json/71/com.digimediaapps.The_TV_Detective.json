    "description": "The new TV Detective mystery by BBC Correspondent Simon Hall...  The TV Detective finds television reporter Dan Groves newly assigned to the crime beat, and in a state of angst about it.  He needs a crash-course in police work; the solution is to shadow  Detective Chief Inspector Adam Breen on a high-profile murder inquiry, which doesnât go down well with some members of the police force.  The victim is a notorious local businessman, Edward Bray, a man with so many enemies that one of the problems the inquiry faces is having a surplus of suspects.  Bray is killed at a prearranged meeting, in a lay-by on a dark and storm-lashed night, by a blast through the heart from a shotgun.  Adam investigates and uncovers a tantalising question, which seems to be at the heart of the case: why was the killing planned for a different day, but put off apparently because the weather was sunny?  Tensions abound between Dan and the police, and he comes close to being thrown off the case - until the detectives come to realise he might actually be helpful, in using the power of television to tempt the murderer into a trap...           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
