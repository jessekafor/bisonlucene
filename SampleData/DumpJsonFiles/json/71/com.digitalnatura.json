Unfortunately, due its unyielding structure, it has formatting quirks and the import/export of Celtx files misses and adds formatting elements, such as INT/EXT and DAY/NIGHT on a montage title.",

It makes my life much easier since it fills a gap in no other decent final draft app.  That being said there are some quirks: I don\\'t like how your only time options are day and night. Evening and Morning would be useful. I don\\'t like the way parentheticals work either. Screws up some dialogue. The outline feature is odd and doesn\\'t really work they way its described. Shots get kind of weird in the formatting as well as (cont\\'d) on characters but that might be the way that the files are being imported.  I know that sounds like a lot but this app gets a lot of things right.  So keep up the good work and keep the updates coming.",

Exporting from Final Draft is easy and (with the exception of some lost scene headers) seamless. Well, this app also doesn\\'t seem to want to play with mid-dialog parentheticals, opting to break each one into a new dialog box upon importation as well.  I only briefly tested the export back to my desktop, but it looked great as well, no losses or errors as far as I could tell on a skim-through, and it even lets you export to PDF!  As far as writing on the app itself, very smooth sailing, but adding a new paragraph to the middle of an existing scene can be a bit hard if you\\'re writing long scenes (and in most cases, you shouldn\\'t).  Other than that, I haven\\'t even bothered looking at the competition! For a free app, that\\'s pretty amazing.",
