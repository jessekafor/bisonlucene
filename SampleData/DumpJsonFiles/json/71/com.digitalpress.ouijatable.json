    "description": "*********************************************************** Ouija Table is not a game! It is an app that detects electromagnetic field and strange signal recorded by the sensors of your device and translates them into 3 real words, an app that might help you experience the mysteries which surround you and that you are totally unaware. IS A PERFECT APP FOR GHOST HUNTERS TEAM!!! *********************************************************** Ouija table is a special entertainment app, unlike other similar applications that are intended to represent more or less the look of the app game, Ouija table uses a proprietary algorithm to detect via sensors possible disturbances due to magnetic fields and other. The app not is then a game but it is proposed to intercept and detect electromagnetic fields that surround us and translate them into real phrases. Ouija table is not a game but a more particular app. The user after a notice for read about the results are not driven but they are result of processing a proprietary algorithm, can launch the application. ****** Then you have only to wait the app scanning and detects the fields and translates them into 3 different words while moving the disk on the tablet. The phrases should be taken with due importance, the app makes a sort of signal transduction by writing the words where they are directly interpretable ****** Ouija table thus allows you to enter the paranormal world with results that will surprise you. The best way to use Ouija table is in the company of friends, participating in a session with the right atmosphere and seriousness that this app requires. If the paranormal fascinates you and look for an app about this,Ouija board is the best app for this. About the Ouija board here are some tricks / legends about this tool: â¢Never play alone â¢Never let the spirits run through the numbers or the alphabet in order until the beginning or end, because that could get out of the tablet. â¢If the pointer touches the four corners of the tablet you have contacted an evil spirit. â¢Never use a Oui-ja when you are weak or sick because they are more open to the possession of any kind. â¢Never use a Oui-ja in a cemetery or where it happened a violent death. You just have to try it... â¢Never play alone â¢Never let the spirits run through the numbers or the alphabet in order until the beginning or end, because that could get out of the tablet. â¢If the pointer touches the four corners of the tablet you have contacted an evil spirit. â¢Never use a Oui-ja when you are weak or sick because they are more open to the possession of any kind. â¢Never use a Oui-ja in a cemetery or where it happened a violent death. You just have to try it ... IMPORTANT NOTES ON depending on the APP: Ouija table does not work like a normal Ouija board, you must not ask questions, and not need to keep it pressed something. You just start the app and see what the app write if found a strange signal, the app it will attempt to detect possible anomalies through all the sensors available on your device and will try to translate using our proprietary algorithm these anomalies in 3 words. In this way the app works as a sort of \"ghost hunting\", remember that Ouija table is not really a game, is a tool to analyze and try to find something that maybe through our senses can not perceive. THE RESULTS ARE IS A FACTOR IN WHOLE UNCONTROLLABLE WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY PARTICULAR RESULT FROM THE USE APP OR ACCURACY OF THE PHRASES OR SENTENCES OF THE SENSE OF. IF YOUR APP CRASH PLEASE CONTACT US FOR OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT!",
