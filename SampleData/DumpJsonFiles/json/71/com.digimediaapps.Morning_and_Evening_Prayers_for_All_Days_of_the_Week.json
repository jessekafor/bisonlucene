    "description": "Preface-This little manual of prayers herewith offered to English speaking Christians in their own language, has long been one of the treasures of the German people. With the exception of a few prayers, as hereinafter noted, it was originally written by one of Godâs noblemen, by one who âlived and moved and had his beingâ in the things of the Kingdom of God. Dr. John Habermann (known also as Avenarius, Latinized form of Habermann) died 1590 as superintendent at Zeitz, was a famous preacher and a distinguished scholar of his day. He was noted for his profound knowledge of oriental languages especially of the Hebrew. Still it is not this but the fact of his little prayer book that has endeared him to his fellow Christians.            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
