    "description": "In April 2000, Kirsty Bilskiâs life couldnât have been happier. It was a time of celebration and the start of a new life and brighter future for her and her new husband, Jerzy, together with her three children from her previous marriage, Jessica, Gemma and Stewart. Six months later, however, her familyâs world was shaken to its very core when Jessica, at the tender age of ten, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of liver cancer. This is the heart-rending story of Jessicaâs courageous journey through her illness, told through the eyes of her mother, who travelled alongside her daughter every step of the way, refusing to give up hope and guiding her with an incredible honesty that allowed Jessica to make important decisions about her own care, the most harrowing of all coming with the acceptance that she was going to die and that pursuing further treatment was not going to save her. There are highs, such as family holidays and meeting Myleene Klass, who dedicated her debut album to Jessicaâs memory, and there are extreme lows as Jessica, in February 2002, finally loses her fight for life in the beautiful and supportive surroundings of Little Bridge House Childrenâs Hospice. Jessica was an inspirational child who touched the hearts of many during her short lifetime, and she will continue to do so through this moving tribute.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
