    "description": "Preface-Among the elusive figures of early American Drama stands John Leacock, author of \"The Fall of British Tyranny,\"[1] published in 1776, in Philadelphia. Even more elusive is the identification, inasmuch as his name has been spelled variously Leacock, Lacock, and Laycock. To add to the confusion, Watson's \"Annals of Philadelphia,\" on the reminiscent word of an old resident of that town, declares that Joseph Leacock penned \"The Medley.\"[2] \"He wrote also a play, with good humour,\" says this authority, \"called 'British Tyranny.'\" On careful search of the files, no definite information in regard to Leacock has been forthcoming. The dedication to \"The Fall of British Tyranny\" was signed \"Dick Rifle,\" but there is no information to be traced from this pseudonym.            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
