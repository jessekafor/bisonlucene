    "description": "One of the most widely read and highly acclaimed religious books, God of Surprises takes us on the inner journey, convinced that the treasure is hidden within.  Jesus said: âThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure in a field.â  This book has only one purpose: to suggest ways of finding the treasure in what we may consider a most unlikely field â ourselves.  It is a guide book to the inner journey in which we are all engaged and has much to say to those who have a love/hate relationship with the Church to which they belong or once belonged.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
