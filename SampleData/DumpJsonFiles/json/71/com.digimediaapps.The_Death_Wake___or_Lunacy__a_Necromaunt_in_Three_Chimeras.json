    "description": "Intorduction-Apart from its rarity, The Death-Wake has an interest of its own for curious amateurs of poetry. The year of its composition (1830) was the great year of Romanticisme in France, the year of Hernani, and of Gautier's gilet rouge. In France it was a literary age [4] given to mediÃ¦val extravagance, to the dagger and the bowl, the cloak and sword, the mad monk and the were-wolf; the age of PÃ©trus Borel and MacKeat, as well as of Dumas and Hugo. Now the official poetry of our country was untouched by and ignorant of the virtues and excesses of 1830. Wordsworth's bolt was practically shot; Sir Walter was ending his glorious career; Shelley and Byron and Keats were dead, and the annus mirabilis of Coleridge was long gone by. Three young poets of the English-speaking race were producing their volumes, destined at first to temporary neglect.            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
