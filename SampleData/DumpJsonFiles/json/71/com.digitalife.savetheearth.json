    "description": "Save the Earth is a game about cataclysmic events that have happened and may occur in the future of our planet. You are in command and your duty is to prolong our planet's life as long as possible.Like in the real world, money governs everything, so every missile you fire to stop a threat, it consumes a portion of the global economy. Use the money wisely and try to achieve the highest score :).Guide to play the game:Before any cataclysm, a picture appears on the screen illustrating a method of prevention against that specific threat. For solar flares the electricity must be cu off, for asteroids, black holes and comets the astronomers must search the space with telescopes.You must click on the picture to earn money and reduce the number of missile you have to fire in order to destroy the comet/asteroid. Each rocket costs money and if you want to repair the damage on Earth you have to pay a substantial amount of cash.The score is in fact the year until you saved the Earth.Asteroids and comets that pass the Critical Zone, are unstoppable by any method.",

        "comment": "You have 3 disasters to cope with and 2 ways of dealing with them. Point and shot rockets or tap to shut down power. It\\'s a nice app but after playing it once you won\\'t feel the desire to open it again. Add more features like enlarging the critical zone, auto turrets, more guns and disasters.",
