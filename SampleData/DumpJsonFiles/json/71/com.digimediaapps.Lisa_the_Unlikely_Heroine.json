    "description": "A free working holiday to Bermuda seems too good an opportunity for part-time cleaner Lisa to resist. However, her employer, Sir Ralph Higgins, an international banker, gets duped into smuggling drugs and is arrested at Bermuda International Airport. Lisa's troubles are only just beginning and it isnât turning out to be the sunshine holiday she thought it would be. Along with Sir Ralphâs wife and other members of his household staff, Lisa has to outwit a corrupt chief of police and his criminal associates. Their course of amateur detection leads them through a series of dangerous adventures on the island, putting their lives at risk, and it results in their becoming victims of the curse of the Bermuda Triangle.
