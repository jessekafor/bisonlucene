    "description": "Are you amongst those who fly because they have to, yet dread it? You are in good company. There are many like you who reluctantly fly, perhaps because of work or due to the fact they wonât allow their fears to curtail their enjoyment of life.  Statistics are of no help. What can help, though, is a better understanding of exactly what is happening during a typical flight from the only vantage point that counts, your passenger seat.  This eBook uses friendly language and terminology to clearly explain the sounds and noises you hear that may worry you and it tells you the truth about turbulence and adverse weather. Rest assured. Itâs good news.  The format is simple. You are guided through a complete flight from boarding an aircraft, through taxiing to take-off, climb, cruise, descent and finally to landing. Along the way you will become familiar with the different stages of flight and what sounds and sensations you may expect. You will learn about an aircrafts capabilities, crew training, air traffic control and the systems in place to ensure your safety. More importantly you will learn that you do not need to concern yourself with the discomfort of a bumpy flight.  Flying without fear....... It can happen.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
