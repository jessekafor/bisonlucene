    "description": "What is it about a good book that hooks the reader and makes them want more? A good plot.  Every best-selling author from Agatha Christie to Terry Pratchett knows the importance of a strong story.  But for the budding author it can be daunting and even confusing.  How do you turn that seed of an idea into a great epic?  This authoritative guide will help steer new writers through the minefield of the writing process.  Using examples from her own work, and that of other top authors, Jean explains how to create memorable characters, generate cliffhangers and keep up a pace that will hook readers.  And when youâve done that, she even gives advice on how to work with publishers and editors to make your novel a best seller.  Jean Saunders is an award-winning author of more than 600 short stories and 100 novels from contemporary fiction and historical romance to crime and erotica. Sheâs best-known worldwide as Rowena Summers, the writer of many novels based in the West Country, and Rachel Moore, author of wartime sagas set in Cornwall.  Her WW1 saga Bannister Girls was short-listed for the Romantic Novel of the Year award. A former chairman of the Romantic Novelists Association, Jean now lectures on writing and writes a monthly column for Writing Magazine. Successful Novel Plotting is the most recent in her series of how to guide books for writers. She lives in Weston-super-Mare with her husband Geoff and family.
