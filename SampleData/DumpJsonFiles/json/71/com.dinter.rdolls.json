    "description": "Have you ever tried to assemble Russian dolls (matryoshka)? Now you can do it with your mobile phone. An addictive casual game was completely âhand-madeâ in Russia with true cultural and design inspiration. Unique gameplay and classic Russian style design will give you a lot of fun. You have one minute to assemble as many dolls as possible. Solid color dolls give greater awards. Each assembled doll is removed from scene to cabinet and adds score. The game has two modes: Blitz mode (one minute play) and Relaxed mode (unlimited time play). Your goal in Blitz mode is to obtain maximum score during 1 minute play and beat high score. The goal in Relaxed mode is to unlock all magic dolls and bonuses. The game uses shake sensor to clear scene and proximity sensor to select moving direction of the new doll parts.If you like this game, please write some words about it (in review) and add some stars.PERMISSIONS: Application does not require any permissions. Application is absolutely free from spam, advertisement, viruses, etc.SCREEN RESOLUTIONS: Application designed for resolution 800 * 480. On other screen resolutions some visual glitches may present.",
