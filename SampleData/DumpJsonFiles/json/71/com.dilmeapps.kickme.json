        "comment": "I love this app, but I only have a couple things I dislike. I can\\'t go back to a session and leave a note, like if I had soda or just ate, or forgot to end the session at whatever time. Second is I can only enter whole minutes from the last kick which looks inacccurate when he kicked 5 times within a couple mins before I got the app out. Last I would like there to be a settings menu. It could open up much more customization if you are picky as me, lots of ideas. I would pay 1.99 for an improved version",
