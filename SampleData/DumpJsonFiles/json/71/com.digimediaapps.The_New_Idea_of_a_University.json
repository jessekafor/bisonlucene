    "description": "Something has gone deeply wrong with the university - too deeply wrong to be put right by any merely bureaucratic means. WhatÎÃÃs wrong is, simply, that our official idea of education, the idea that inspires all government policies and ÎÃÃ¿initiativesÎÃÃ, is itself uneducated. With the growing emphasis in higher education on training in supposedly useful skills, has the very ethos of the university been subverted? And does this more utilitarian university succeed in adding to the national wealth, the basis on which politicians justify the large public expenditure on the higher education system? Should we get our idea of a university from politicians and bureaucrats or from J.H. Newman, Jane Austen and Socrates?The New Idea of a University is an entertaining and highly readable defence of the philosophy of liberal arts education and an attack on the sham that has been substituted for it. It is sure to scandalize all the friends of the present establishment and be cheered elsewhere.Please Note that the book is stored on your phone and you do NOT need a data connection to read it.This is a full-length, quality digitized book.The New Idea of a University, by Duke Maskell, is packaged with an easy to use functional book reader which means you can down load the App and start reading.This is a full length ebook version of this title.
