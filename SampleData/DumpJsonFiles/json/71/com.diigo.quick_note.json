The only reason I didn\\'t give this a one-star rating was because the developer seems to making some effort to make notes easily accessible offline and compatible with other apps.  Come on, folks... get a grip. I wouldn\\'t even pay $45/year for Evernote, which is light years ahead of this app (but worse about user lock-in).",
