    "description": "Phonics Guessing Game is two apps in one, Phonics Cards and the Guessing Game.  In the Phonics Cards game, preschoolers befriend 26 fun and culturally diverse characters from the world of Scholarville, and together they embark on an adventure in learning the fundamentals of alphabet letter sounds, and upper and lowercase letters. Characters like Addy the Acrobat and Bob the Baker introduce their letter.  The Guessing Game, a child favorite, reinforces each letter by introducing beginning sounds of words.  Three clues to an item that begins with the letter under study are read to a child who can answer or flip the card to see the right answer.  Even older kids who have mastered the alphabet love this game.  A total of 5 cards/letter, 130 cards in all, are included in the app.Phonic Guessing Game plus two other apps, Phonics Trace & Learn and Phonics Matching & Memory, were taken from an iPhone app, Phonics Fun & Games that received 4.5 stars and an \"Editors Choice\" rating from BestAppsforKids.com and a \"Top Pick\" rating from FunEducationalApps.com",
