        "comment": "Really enjoyed playing notes on the virtual pan - it is very responsive to touch and the notes are real sounding. You can also play intervals. Arrangements can also be recorded. Well done. On version 2.0 a way should be created to share recordings over social sites though.  And if the notes can be displayed on all pans for those who don\\'t have perfectly tuned ears like myself. Lol. But great app.",

If you gave it five stars, then you haven\\'t tried anything better. Downloads and endorsement, and especially quantity, do not equal quality. 1 billion can download an app, if all of them uninstall it, it still shows over 1 billion downloads.",
