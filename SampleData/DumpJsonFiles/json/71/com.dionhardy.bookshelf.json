        "title": "Handy App",
        "comment": "I have used this app for a few months and think it does a good job.  There is a bit of a learning curve for using the ISBN reader.  There are two modes--one scans the barcode one book at a time and makes you wait while it searches for that book on the web.  The other mode will look up scanned books up while you continue to scan other books in your library.  This is helpful, but if the process is interrupted, I had to go back and request individual lookup for books later on.  The program does not work well once the phone goes into \\\"idle\\\" mode\\\", and if you \\\"wake up\\\" the phone, it interrupts the lookup process.  That being said, it is the best app I have seen for the Android to get your library into your phone, and the search function works quite well.",

        "comment": "I have a large (~1000 books) professional \\\"working library\\\" that I use every day. The bookshelf app has become an indispensable tool for me, and a wonderful time saver. I used to spend lengthy periods scanning my shelves, trying to find a particular book. Now, I can go straight to the right shelf in seconds. Another benefit is that I used to end up buying duplicate copies of a book I forgot I already had. Now I can quickly check my library to see if I already have a book (which I may have forgotten about). It took a while to get used to the user interface of the Bookshelf app, but it now seems easy. It took some time to scan in all my books -- and the automatic looku-p process sometimes needs a bit of prodding, but overall the data entry has not been too much of a barrier. I highly recommend Bookshelf to anyone who has a large library and is tired of wasting time looking for a particular item.",

I needed something that allowed me to quickly verify the titles I already own and track the titles I still need to find. This app gives me that capacity.  I would really like to see the ability to nest shelves such as by genre then author (e.g. main shelf = Fiction + sub shelf = Author). This would allow me to organize my library in a more granular fashion, although I realize that it could complicate the application\\'s interface.  The author also offers useful apps for CD and DVD libraries. Making a donation gets you a key that removes advertisements for all of the apps, although you need to enter the key into each app. It was worth making a donation to remove the ads especially when considering the value I received for the product.  Keep up the good work!",

Book catalogue was fast, full color and much more intuitive, although it has its share of confusing things. Also, wish it synced up to a website to keep and maintain library from multiple places.",
