    "description": "'Floundering in the footsteps of a deliberately downplayed police enquiry, Libby manages to stir up more mud than the rotavator'. When television personality Lewis Osbourne-Walker buys Creekmarsh Place, near Steeple Martin in Kent, Libby Sarjeant's son Adam is employed to help with the renovation of the garden. What he doesn't expect is to uncover a long buried corpse. Libby, naturally, wants to know more about it, but the police aren't going to tell her, and with her friend Fran's mind on other things, she has to go it alone, with interesting and possibly catastrophic results.",
