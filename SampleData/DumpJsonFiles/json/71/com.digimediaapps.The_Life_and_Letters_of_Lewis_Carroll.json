    "description": "The Author-My task has been a delightful one to write this biography of Lewis Carroll(Rev C L Dodgson). Intimately as I thought I knew Mr. Dodgson during his life, I seem since his death to have become still better acquainted with him. If this Memoir helps others of his admirers to a fuller knowledge of a man whom to know was to love, I shall not have written in vain.",
