    "description": "Optical illusions are the stuff of magic - harmless entertainment conjured up to both enthral and amaze, arenât they? Well, maybe not, as itâs not quite so amusing if the âstuntâ takes the form of an episode of the BBCâs âgroundbreakingâ documentary series MacIntyre Undercover on organised football hooliganism, the wizardry is conducted by unscrupulous investigative journalists posing as big-time drug dealers, and as a result the unwitting participant in the trick, avid Chelsea supporter Jason Marriner, is charged with conspiracy to commit violent disorder and affray, together with his friend Andy Frain, and Jason ends up with a six-year jail sentence for a crime he didnât commit. This is Jasonâs chance to put the record straight, present the facts from his own perspective and challenge the reader, who may well have been one of the 7.4 million documentary viewers, to decide whether the programme actually revealed the âugly face of football violenceâ, or indeed showed him plotting or committing any violence whatsoever, or whether the original 344 hoursâ worth of footage, secretly filmed over a period of 18 months, were distorted beyond recognition by cutting, editing and stitching together clips from the original sequences to achieve the programmeâs aim at any cost. Jason would be the first to admit that in the past he had been a ânuisanceâ on the terraces, but this was the late 1990s and, with a wife, children and his own business, he had done a lot of growing up and moving on. Fortunately, he had also developed the strength of character needed to survive in prison with humour, dignity and determination, and he shares his insights of life behind bars as he tried to work with the system, despite the knock-backs, in order to make it work for him in return. âGood will always follow badâ is Jasonâs admirable philosophy about his experiences, but this shocking real-life story serves as a warning to all: this could so easily happen to you.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
