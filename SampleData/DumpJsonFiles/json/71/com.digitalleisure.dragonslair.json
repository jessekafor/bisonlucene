        "comment": "Installation problems have finally stopped. Install complete and enjoyment begun! *********************** Previous review: I long to be taken back to my childhood gaming days and finally finish the adventures of Dragon\\'s Lair that I never got to finish in the arcade. I would love to give this a 5 star, but the consistent installation problems are keeping me from doing that.  The DEMO version worked great, so I took the plunge and bought the full version, eagerly anticipating the journey down memory lane. Alas, all I get are frozen screens during the download and unpacking of additional resources. I\\'ve tried multiple, multiple times and it keeps getting stuck at different spots along the installation. Sometimes at Loading, sometimes at Unpacking, but always before finishing. When or If I ever get the installation completed, I will love it and hold it and stroke it gently, telling it what an amazing piece of retro gaming history it is. But until then ... 1 star and no love for you!  ASUS Transformer Prime TF201",
