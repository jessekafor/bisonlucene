Each challenge consists of 12 puzzles to test your skills. The puzzles gets harder on each level. Complete the student challenge to move on to the master challenge and then complete it to have a shot at genius challenge. If you can crack all the 36 puzzles you may consider yourself as a true math genius.When you train your brain by using maths problems you actively exercise several areas of the brain that are responsible for decision making, thought processes and critical analysis. Maths sharpens the mind by forcing the brain to think differently for ways to solve different problems. The more skilled you get at solving problems the more difficult challenges you will be prepared for.",
