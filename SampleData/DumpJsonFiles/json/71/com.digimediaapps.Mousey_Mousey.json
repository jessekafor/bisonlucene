    "description": "Three fabulous stories for children aged four to 10 about a delightful little mouse called Mousey Mouse,whose favourite colour is pink.Children are finding Mousey Mousey as cute as the little mouse in Julia Donaldson's The Gruffalo and even more magical than Jacqueline Wilson's Glubbslyme. No wonder Heather Flood's book is being acclaimed as the best for young children since Enid Blyton's Noddy and Beatrix Potter's The Tales of Peter Rabbit.In the first story Mousey Mousey has her world turned upside down by a naughty witch called Agatha, who comes for tea and changes all her pink things into black or purple. A heartbroken Mousey Mousey is horrified when the witch's daughter Bernice also visits her cottage and asks if she can have some tea, too. Should she let the young witch in? The second story tells how Mousey Mousey is kidnapped by a giant, who Bernice has turned into a huge parrot. Can she count on Bernice â or even Agatha - to come to her rescue? The third story is about a village fete being held by Mousey Mousey and her friends Ben Badger, Rachel Rabbit and Molly Mole â their wonderful day is in danger of being wrecked when Agatha turns up. The charming Mousey Mousey may be small and gentle, but she is determined that good should triumph over bad â no wonder she is being hailed as the new Hello Kitty, a fantasy character idolised by young children throughout the word.
