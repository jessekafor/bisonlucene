    "description": "Just tap the blue cards to draw a single card for play.  Tap any section to highlight that area, then tap another section to attempt to move a card or cards to that section.  This game is the Android derived of my other versions of Klondike. (see promo video for other versions) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m29yyRRviPk...The reason why this version is free is because there's a catch: you're only playing with a deck of 51 cards. :)(Update) All 52 cards are now included in this game.If you found this app at a site other than the Android Marketplace, Digiwack Software does not support any \"features\" that may have been added after it was scrapped from the Android Marketplace site. You can find the original source of this App here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Digiwack+Software",
