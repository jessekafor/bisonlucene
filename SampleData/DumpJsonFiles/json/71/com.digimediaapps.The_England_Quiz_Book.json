    "description": "All England fans beware! You may think you know all there is to know about the England team, but to answer the 1,000 fiendish questions in this quiz book you will need to cast your minds back well over a century, right back to the beginnings of international football in 1872. Guaranteed to challenge the knowledge of even the most ardent England fan and covering every Cup, Tour, Tournament and Championship imaginable, as well as managers, greats, records, top goalscorers, debuts, hat-trick heroes and a mountain of general trivia, 'corner' might take on a whole new meaning as you are banished to it wearing a dunce's hat. With a fitting foreword by Tony Adams, a veritable treasure trove of facts and figures will be at your fingertips if not on your tongue, sparking fond reminiscences of the legendary characters and match highs and lows that have shaped the history of English football.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
