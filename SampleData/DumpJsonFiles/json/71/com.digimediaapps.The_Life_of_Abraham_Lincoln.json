    "description": "\"To the younger generation,\" writes Carl Schurz, \"Abraham Lincoln has already become a half mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic distance, grows to more and more heroic proportions, but also loses in distinctness of outline and figure.\" The last clause of this remark is painfully true. To the majority of people now living, his outline and figure are dim and vague. There are to-day professors and presidents of colleges, legislators of prominence, lawyers and judges, literary men, and successful business men, to whom Lincoln is a tradition. It cannot be expected that a person born after the year (say) 1855, could remember Lincoln more than as a name. Such an one's ideas are made up not from his remembrance and appreciation of events as they occurred, but from what he has read and heard about them in subsequent years.            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
