    "description": "Join the discussion group:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/prospec-discussion-groupUser Manual:http://www.digiphd.com/prospec-real-time-spectrum-analyzer-user-manual/ProSpec - Lite is a basic Real time spectrum analysis tool. It generates a spectrogram on the fly and supports 8kHz and 44.1kHz sampling frequencies.You can record, playback, save and share the spectrogram for a given time frame. It provides a maximum frequency tracking facility with measurements both in dBFS, (SPL in paid version only). Other features include:- Time scale in seconds- Update speed- Dynamic range control- Complete color customisation- RGB option- For audio engineers, an invert feature for live events in dark rooms- Audio tool, allowing you to share, save and listen to the complete audio that has been recorded - Saving, sharing and exporting the configuration (i.e. analysis settings: window size, dynamic range, FFT length and analysis window)NOTE: If you are not satisfied or find any issues with ProSpec, please tell me in the discussion group before leaving negative feedback, I may be able to resolve your issue in an update and your input will be invaluable to ProSpec's evolution. Thanks!USEFUL FOR:home theatre, audio engineer, car audio, linguistics, speech pathology, electronic engineer, tech savvy musicians, engineering and audiologist studentsTECHNICAL INFORMATION- FFT size fixed to 1024 for 8kHz and 512 for 44.1kHz- Uses a moving window to calculate the FFT Magnitude spectrum- Uses Hamming analysis window- Frame Length fixed to 32ms- Frame shift fixed to 14ms- Dynamic range: -1dB to -90dB- Bandwidth available: 50Hz - 22.05kHz- Selectable update time from (10-40s)(also depends on frame length)- JET RGB color scheme (and many many many others)- Free version has watermarked images when saving or sharingWORD FROM THE DEVELOPER:I developed this tool to use personally and I believe it has some use to others in the community. ProSpec also has some major advantages over other real-time spectrogram apps available for free. e.g. time scale (x-axis labels), saving settings and sharing the audio and images, and maximum frequency tracking. These are all features I wanted a single tool to have, unfortunately all others seemed to fall short, hence ProSpec has been developed to accommodate my needs, and hopefully yours.Tested Devices (Better suited for dual core devices):Motorola Xoom with Android 4.0.4 (Good)Samsung Galaxy S III (Quad core, AU release) with Android 4.0.4 (Good)Sony Xperia with Android 4.0.4 (Good)Motorola Atrix 2 with Android 2.3.6 (Good, must have sdcard installed)HTC Desire HD with Android 2.3.5 (A bit slow)Motorola Atrix with Android 2.3.4 (Good)HTC Incredible S with Android 2.3.5 (A bit slow)BUGS AND REPORTS:Apologies for incompatibilities on devices other than the ones listed above, I have limited resources and don't have access to the thousands of phones and tablets out there. If you find any bugs or issues please take the time to e-mail me (miscanalysis@gmail.com) and include what you were doing at the time the bug occurred. Like image was synthesised from accumulating sine waves into an audio file.",
