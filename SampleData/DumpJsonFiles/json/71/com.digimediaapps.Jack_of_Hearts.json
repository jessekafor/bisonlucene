    "description": "Bob Heggie is a banker at the end of a dead end career. He hates his job, his boss, his life. His wife has left him. He hardly knows his kids and his closest friend is a down and out newspaper seller and they're not really close. In the early mornings he wanders the moors of Northern England with a pair of dogs he doesn't like, listening to Bob Dylan sing about a great bank robbery on his iPod. The Jack of Hearts in that song is the kind of man Bob imagines himself to be, but he knows he'll always be just plain old boring Bob Heggie Then one morning he is nearly killed in an armed robbery and he starts to think. If he were to steal the bank's money, he'd come up with a better way. But would he survive to spend his ill gotten gains?           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
