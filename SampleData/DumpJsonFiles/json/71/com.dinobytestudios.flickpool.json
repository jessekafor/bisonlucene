Tap the cue ball whilst aiming or shooting to add pool ball spin.*** TIPS ON PLAYING LIKE A PRO ***You don't need to hold the pool cue to move it, just swipe your finger across the screen in the direction the pool cue is pointing to shoot!You will get more accuracy the further away from the cue ball your finger is when aiming.

Instability, when trying to line up your shots! Made it kinda suck. But all in all good pool game! That last update \\\"did NOT\\\" help things,  now the balls keep bouncing around WAY TO MUCH! Was better before! More realistic.",

        "comment": "Rules definitely needs to be evaluated and modified. How does making an 8 or 9 ball on the break its a loss? How does making an opponents ball after striking your object ball result in a ball in hand for your opponent? Overall the function of the game its good, but the  rules suck and need to be changed to reflect bca or apa rules.",
