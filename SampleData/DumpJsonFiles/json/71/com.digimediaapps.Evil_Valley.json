    "description": "Evil Valley is the second TV Detective mystery by BBC Correspondent Simon Hall. Adam and Dan are hunting a psychopath, a once brilliant man, demented by memories of war and the death of his best friend - and utterly bent on teaching society a lesson... A masked man breaks into women's homes, never speaking and stealing nothing of value, only a document bearing their name. Soon, he leaves behind a sinister note, boasting of plans to commit a great crime; a crime that will shock the country. A police marksman kills two men in seperate but frighteningly similar shootings - but is it murder? Another woman is attacked, another document taken, another note left. It claims each contains a code revealing the 'great crime' - and it's growing closer, hour by passing hour. Why does the attacker steal only documents with women's names on? How to solve the riddle contained in the notes? Time is running out. As each riddle is cracked, the man is always one step ahead of the police - until the inceasingly desperate search converges on Dartmoor...
