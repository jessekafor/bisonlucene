And there are lots of ways to calculate.Calculator, answer sheet, calculate directly...But calculator is the best way of them.(Almost teachers bring nswer sheet)There are lots of kinds of calculator.But there was no calculator for students.Digut Student Calculator was born for that.Major features are listed below: # Get Greatest Common Divisor(GCD)/Least Common Multiple(LCM). # Check if number is prime number. # Calculate quadratic equation # Get quadratic equation # And more by future updates!There could not be calculation that you want.But if you ask, we'll add the calculation you asked,and we'll do our best to make that Digut Student Calculator is 'Must-have' application for students,not just once install and deleting application.Note.
