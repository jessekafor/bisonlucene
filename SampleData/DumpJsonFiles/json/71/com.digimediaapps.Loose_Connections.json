    "description": "A dark, humorous drama, which blurs the line between online relationships and real life...  Mother-of-two Rosemary is a woman under pressure. With two difficult teenaged children, a distant husband and a busy job, the stress is mounting.  The loss of her internet connection pushes her over the edge.  After waiting a month and two failed attempts to fix the problem, a third repair man arrives. When he too says he canât get her back online, his incompetence forces Rosemary to take drastic action.  The repair man realises that Rosemary is not as naive as she first appears. She is a woman with a secret and is capable of causing him harm.  Loose Connections is a darkly humorous story about how computers can distance people from the real world around them.",
