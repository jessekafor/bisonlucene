        "title": "very nice app , small glitch in airplane command",
        "comment": "I installed on my sony mini pro (android v2.3) and it is working great. There is one minor problem in airplane command. After sending a airplane command it immediately places the mobile in airplane mode so the mobile doesnt get an opportunity to relay the sms received status back to the mobile service provider. As a result , once you quit airplane mode , the service provider would resend the previous sms , resulting in this app placing the mobile again in airplane mode. This would be a continuous loop. Only way to come out of it is to disable the airplane command temporarily in the app. One more minor issue is there is no way to stop the ringer after placing the phone in ring mode. Otherwise all other features are working perfectly. If i ask for a new feature is to enable 2G/3G data similar to wifi on/off feature. Thanks for this wonderful app. well deserved 5 Star.",

        "comment": "This app is visible in launcher, so if someone stole my phone then they could factory reset my phone and then it wont work for me cuz it would be uninstalled! tried installing as a system app but its installed at /data/app in a zip archive so i cant do that. Useless to me b/c of that. If i can install as a system app then i will re download.",
