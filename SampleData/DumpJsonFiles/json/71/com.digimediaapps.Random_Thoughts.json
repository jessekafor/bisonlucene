    "description": "Total nonsense or the wisdom of a 21st century Welsh visionary? From Walesâ rising star of comedy.  Chris Corcoran opens his mind to share every thought heâs ever had, in his own random order.  There are insights into his life as he takes readers back to his Eighties school disco days to reveal how the greatest moment of his teenage years was ruined by Queenâs Radio Ga-Ga.  He also shares the wisdom of his life experience from his time on CBeebiesâ Doodle Do with a lesson on the dangers of toilet roll.  And he answers many of lifeâs great questions... Why isnât optimism enough to complete a marathon? Why does food taste better in a field? And, more importantly, what is the point of Petit Filous?  These thoughts and more are all here, delivered in his unique affectionate and charming way.",
