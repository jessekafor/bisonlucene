        "comment": "Anytime there is this type of wallpaper, people with ape like intelligence come out the woodwork.  Maybe some do not know about the swastikas origin. Ironic really, given its usage. Hitler and his ball boys can suck my live wallpaper. If you seek group activity with such desperation; go to jail.  Ahhh, less I forget.... thanks for the cool wallpaper, unfortunately crashes like mad for me. Not the cleanest; ad supported.",
