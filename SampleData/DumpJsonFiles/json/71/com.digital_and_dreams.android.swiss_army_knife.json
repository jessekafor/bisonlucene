    "description": "This app contains a set of tiny tools: a flashlight, a unit converter, a timer, a stopwatch, a compass a bubble level, a calculator, a magnifying glass (Android 2.2+ required), a mirror (Android 2.3+ and front camera required) and a ruler.Each tool does what it is supposed to do. There's no space for special effects like 3D compass, talking level, psychedelic flashlight etc: the goal is to have a lightweight, fast and easy to use set of tools, one \"tap\" away from your home screen.This app is half the size of a common \"standalone tool\" like a compass, a flashlight or a magnifying glass. This way you'll save a lot of disk space. You'll save network consumption too, not only for the first download but for every update too.It doesn't require network access, the permission to write on your flash memory or the permission to read your contacts.Suggestions, like new features to implement, new tools etc. are welcome. If you want to contribute a translation, please let us know by sending us an email ;)If you find a bug, please contact us using the \"Report a bug\" main menu function.Note: if you write a comment on the Android Market without sending us an email, it's difficult for us to fix the problem, because usually we need some information (such as smartphone type and version, a way to replicate the problem, etc.).Note:- Depending on the hardware capabilities of your device, some tools may not be shown- The permission to use the camera is required in order to turn on the camera flash LED. Some devices (for instance the Google Nexus S) don't light the flash LED if the camera is not running. If you check the most popular flashlight apps, you'll find out that they all require this permission. Swiss Army Knife doesn't shoot any photos, doesn't save multimedia info onto the flash card and doesn't send anything via the internet: it doesn't require network permissions at all.",

        "comment": "This app is awesome.  I have it on all my android devices.  With all the functionality that is included, I was able to delete a number of other apps and save space.  I used to have a dedicated calculator, compass, bubble level, timer, and stopwatch.  Now I just have Swiss Army Knife and a bunch of free space.  And compared to other \\\"toolbox\\\" type apps, this one rocks on size using less than 20% of the memory (this app is about 750K while the others are 3.5M+).  I recommend this app to everyone I know who has an android device.  The developer is very responsive to bugs and feature requests.  Awesome for a FREE app!!!",

Best scientific calculator around, just like my old casio! Finally I can uninstall lots of other little apps and get back my phones memory for something bigger. Thanks.",
