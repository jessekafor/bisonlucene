    "description": "Ex England cricketer Phillip 'Daffy' DeFreitas has had an incredible career but his rise to fame wasnât straightforward.In his autobiography, the man who was described as âthe next Bothamâ reveals his struggle to establish himself as a cricketer, being repeatedly overlooked because he went to the âwrong sort of schoolâ. He also talks about the racial abuse he suffered and the impact it has had on his life. Despite these setbacks, Phil went on to have a successful career in county cricket and established himself as one of the best âall-roundersâ as an England player in Test cricket. He has played with, and against, some of the biggest names in the game and he has stories to tell about most of them.In this explosive book, Phil not only lifts the lid on the cricket world but also tells about his experiences with his hard drinking idol, Ian Botham, and what they got up to with well known hell-raiser and close friend, Phil Tufnell.Phil also talks about meeting the Queen and Mother Teresa, and his unlikely friendship with pop legend Elton John. He reveals the sensational truth about his love life; how he got married for the first time when he was 21, took full advantage of his popularity with the ladies when he played for England and later fathered a love child.This frank autobiography provides a behind the scenes peek at the world of international cricket and will appeal to anyone with an interest in the sport or who loves a good true life story.
