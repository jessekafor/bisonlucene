        "comment": "I have the DSM50BT module installed and the range is very limited. Also, it would be nice to experiance all functions on the BT connection such as alerts, messages and status within the app.  It seems like Directed SmartStart wants customers to purchase the 250 or 200 to experiance all functions. I also think Directed should intergrate the DSM50BT with the network module (250 or 200).  Last, the application splits in 4 big a$$ buttons: lock, unlock, trunk, panic. While I am approching the car, I tend to accidently touch one of the buttons and triggers. This can be annoying... so now when I send a command, I immediately turn my sreen off - so stupid.",

If you\\'re a distance away, you have no idea whether the command worked or not, and run the risk of shutting off the car by pressing the command again if it did indeed work the first time.
