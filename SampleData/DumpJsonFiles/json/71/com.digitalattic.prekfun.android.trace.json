    "description": "Phonics Trace & Learn is two apps in one, Phonics Cards and the Trace & Learn game.  In the Phonics Cards game, preschoolers befriend 26 fun and culturally diverse characters from the world of Scholarville, and together they embark on an adventure in learning the fundamentals of alphabet letter sounds, and upper and lowercase letters. Characters like Addy the Acrobat and Bob the Baker introduce their letter.  There are 52 phonics cards, an uppercase and lowercase card for each letter of the alphabet.  The Trace & Learn game is designed to teach proper upper and lowercase letter formation, develop fine motor skills and build preliminary handwriting skills. In the game, a child is challenged to form a letter by dragging the green star to the red star.  The game will not permit a letter to be formed the wrong way. Phonics Trace & Learn plus two other apps, Phonics Matching & Memory and Phonics Guessing Game, were taken from an iPhone app, Phonics Fun & Games, that received 4.5 stars and an \"Editors Choice\" rating from BestAppsforKids.com and a \"Top Pick\" rating from FunEducationalApps.com",

Also my brother traced the letters correctly only to say it was wrong. This has happened four times and I am seriously suggesting to delete it. I am not sure if this happens on other phones but this is a Samsung Galaxy Note.",
