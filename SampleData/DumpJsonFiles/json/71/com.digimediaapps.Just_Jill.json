    "description": "Just Jill is an inspirational and moving account of one woman's triumph over adversity and how she used her own experience of disability to benefit others.  When she was growing up during the 1940s very few people were aware that Jill Allen-King had lost an eye as a baby. However, when tragedy struck for the second time and Jill went completely blind on, what should have been, one of the happiest occasions of her life her wedding day, she was rendered housebound. For seven years, Jill barely left the house, too scared to go outside unless she was taken by her husband and family. The birth of her daughter, Jacqueline, gave her renewed purpose but could not give her back the thing she desperately needed her independence. It was only when Jill got her first guide dog that she began to rediscover the world outside of her front door and take those first giant steps towards regaining her freedom. It was a journey that would lead to a life of campaigning for reform and helping others. Jill's autobiography charts her journey from partially sighted child to totally blind adult and beyond, culminating in her being awarded the MBE for her many achievements. Just Jill is an important book that raises questions about what it means to have a disability in our society and how we can all learn from the work of Jill Allen-King.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
