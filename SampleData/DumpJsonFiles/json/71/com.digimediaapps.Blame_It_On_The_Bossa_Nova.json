    "description": "Alex Marshall is in deep trouble.  Heâs only a student drop out but in the space of two months heâs been recruited as an agent by the Soviet, British and U.S secret services; just as the Cuba Crisis is building up to its climax.  And all because heâs developed a crush on a French girl he has just met in London...  This specially formatted ebook version of James Brodie's Debut novel is chapterised for the months of 1962 & 63 during which the first person narrator gets dragged deeper and deeper away from the real world into the enclosed and detached community of international espionage and politics.

Itâs a loving appreciation of the London of that time, not just central London but the suburbs, specific locations.
