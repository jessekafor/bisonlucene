    "description": "Fifteen years ago, the world for Jill and Roger Prior halted in its tracks, with the death of their youngest daughter, Lisa, a talented ballet dancer and teacher. Their devastation, which made them wonder whether there was any point in carrying on, led them on a roller-coaster journey in their search for answers to the meaning of life. Drawn to the Spiritualist church in their quest for proof of the afterlife and the survival of the spirit after death, Jill and Roger met Stephen Holbrook, a gifted medium who was to change their lives forever. With his support, love and compassion, they have managed to move from pain and despair to rebuilding their lives and helping others through the precious knowledge they have found. Peppered with both sadness and humour, this gritty and inspiring autobiography offers those grieving the loss of a loved one a glimmer of hope of light at the end of the dark tunnel that is bereavement, and the assurance that the spirits of those that have passed away live on, can interact with us in this life, and ultimately will be reunited with us in the next.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
