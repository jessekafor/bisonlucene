    "description": "Using none of the traditional routes, Winona Ryder established herself as the single most exciting actress of her generation. From her Hollywood movie debut at the age of thirteen to starring alongside Sigourney Weaver in Alien Resurrection, this affectionate biography traces the events and circumstances that shaped her career and propelled her from teen star to cultural icon. This specially prepared digital edition has been completely revised by restoring passages cut out of the original 1998 manuscript together with the addition of new material.",
