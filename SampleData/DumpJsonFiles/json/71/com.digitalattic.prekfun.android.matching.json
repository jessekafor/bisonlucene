    "description": "Phonics Matching & Memory is two apps in one, Phonics Cards and the Matching & Memory game.  In the Phonics Cards game, preschoolers befriend 26 fun and culturally diverse characters from the world of Scholarville, and together they embark on an adventure in learning the fundamentals of alphabet letter sounds, and upper and lowercase letters. Characters like Addy the Acrobat and Bob the Baker introduce their letter.  There are 52 phonics cards, an uppercase and lowercase card for each letter of the alphabet.  The Matching & Memory game, a child favorite, helps enhance memory skills, visual recognition as well as identification of upper and lowercase letters. The child will flip over two cards and try to match the letters as well as the cases. There are infinite combinations, so the child will never see the combination of upper and lowercase letters twice.Phonics Matching & Memory plus two other apps, Phonics Trace & Learn and Phonics Guessing Game, were taken from an iPhone app, Phonics Fun & Games, that received 4.5 stars and an \"Editors Choice\" rating from BestAppsforKids.com and a \"Top Pick\" rating from FunEducationalApps.com",

        "comment": "The matching portion has a female voice saying the letter names, not the letter sounds, which means it should be called \\\"Alphabet Matching & Memory\\\" without the \\\"phonics\\\" part. The flashcards part doesn\\'t work on the tablet I installed it on. It only shows the upper half of each card. I am uninstalling this program.",
