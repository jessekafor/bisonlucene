    "description": "A fantastic portrait of one of the greatest composers of all time, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.From the Editor's Note: The purpose and scope of this little book will be obvious to the reader from even a cursory glance at its contents. It is, in a way, an autobiography of Mozart written without conscious purpose, and for that reason peculiarly winning, illuminating and convincing. The outward things in Mozart's life are all but ignored in it, but there is a frank and full disclosure of the great musician's artistic, intellectual and moral character, made in his own words. The Editor has not only taken the trouble to revise the work of the German author and compiler, but, for reasons which seemed to him imperative, has also made a new translation of all the excerpts. Most of the translations of Mozart's letters which have found their way into the books betray want of familiarity with the idioms and colloquialisms employed by Mozart, as well as understanding of his careless, contradictory and sprawling epistolary style. Some of the intimacy of that style the new translation seeks to preserve, but the purpose has chiefly been to make the meaning plain.This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***           *** NO ADVERTS! ***           *** FULL LENGTH BOOKS ***This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
