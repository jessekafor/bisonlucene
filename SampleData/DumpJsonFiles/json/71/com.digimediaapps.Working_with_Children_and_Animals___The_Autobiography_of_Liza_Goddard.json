    "description": "Liza Goddard is one of the countryâs best loved and hardest working actresses, but few people know the real woman behind the âdizzy blondeâ image. In this much-anticipated autobiography, Liza talks about her work, her loves and the real-life dramas that have shaped her as a woman and an actress. The book charts her early life in England and follows her to Australia, where her beloved father played a key role in helping to set up the country's fledgling television industry. As a young actress, Liza was cast in the long-running childrenâs drama series, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. She later returned to England, where she appeared in a host of classic TV series, including Pig In The Middle, The Brothers, Bergerac, Dr Who and Midsomer Murders. Liza talks about her working relationship with Alan Ayckbourn and explains how a planned move to America failed to materialise. Find out how Liza got together with her first husband, actor Colin Baker on the set of The Brothers, why her marriage to â70s rocker Alvin Stardust failed and how she eventually found true love with producer David Cobham. Liza also reveals the truth about her alleged affair with Bergerac star John Nettles, and reveals how she successfully sued a tabloid newspaper over the allegations. She describes her courageous battle against breast cancer and reveals how beating the disease has given her a new perspective on life. Liza explains why animals continue to play an important part in her life and recounts some hilarious stories about the assortment of creatures that have featured in her life. A warts and all account from one of Britainâs most popular actresses, Working With Children And Animals will have you laughing and crying in equal measure.           *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
