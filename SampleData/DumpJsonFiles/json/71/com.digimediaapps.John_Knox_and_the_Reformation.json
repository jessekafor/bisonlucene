    "description": "The Author-In this brief Life of Knox I have tried, as much as I may, to get behind Tradition, which has so deeply affected even modern histories of the Scottish Reformation, and even recent Biographies of the Reformer.Â  The tradition is based, to a great extent, on Knoxâs own âHistory,â which I am therefore obliged to criticise as carefully as I can.Â  In his valuable John Knox, a Biography, Professor Hume Brown says that in the âHistoryâ âwe have convincing proof alike of the writerâs good faith, and of his perception of the conditions of historic truth.âÂ  My reasons for dissenting from this favourable view will be found in the following pages.Â  If I am right, if Knox, both as a politician and an historian, resembled Charles I. in âsailing as near the windâ as he could, the circumstance (as another of his biographers remarks) âonly makes him more human and interesting.â            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
