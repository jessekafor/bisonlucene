Customizable shelf names, pictures of the covers, keeps track if you\\'ve read a comic or lent one out. Some oddball, independent comics it doesn\\'t recognize, but you can enter the info manually and take a picture of the cover. Again, awesome app and would recommend to the avid comic book collectors!",

It looks like you\\'re at the mercy of user-entered data on the lookups, but you can fix the inconsistencies pretty easily. If it doesn\\'t know a comic, you can send info to the developer and he\\'s very responsive. It also lets you do a Web lookup to get more info. Great use of a barcode scanner.",
