    "description": "Moral relativism is often regarded as both fatally flawed and incompatible with liberalism. This book aims to show why such criticism is misconceived. First, it argues that relativism provides a plausible account of moral justification. Drawing on the contemporary relativist and universalist analyses of thinkers such as Harman, Nagel and Habermas, it develops an alternative account of âcoherence relativismâ. Turning to liberalism, the book argues that moral relativism is not only consistent with the claims of contemporary liberalism, but underpins those claims. The political liberalism of Rawls and Barry is founded on an unacknowledged commitment to a relativist account of justification. In combining these two elements, the book offers a new understanding of relativism, and demonstrates its relevance for contemporary liberal thought.Please Note that the book is stored on your phone and you do NOT need a data connection to read it.This is a full-length, quality digitized book.Relativism and the Foundations of Liberalism, by Graham Long, is packaged with an easy to use functional book reader which means you can down load the App and start reading.This is a full length ebook version of this title.
