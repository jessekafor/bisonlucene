    "description": "Take a seat in the captain's chair of a Battlecruiser. Decide what type of Space crafts to launch with the click of only one button. Fighters launch fastest, while as bigger they are as more time you need to wait till you can launch them. If you wait long enough you can choose to repair your damage. The game is also in HD and looks good on Tablets.",

        "comment": "No tutorial or backstory, the game just throws you right into a battle with no clue what to do. --- The difficulty seems too high considering hard and impossible modes are locked in the free version (I wouldn\\'t pay to make this game harder than it already is).  Battles draw on for far too long, combat is a matter of repeatedly mashing one button (at different intervals depending on your desired action) which grows old long before the first battle is over. --- After playing this my phone won\\'t go into standby unless I reset it first, I don\\'t know if this bug is in the paid version too but if so that\\'s cause for serious concern.",
