    "description": "We all need to make a retreat. To find a few moments in our busy lives to try to stop worrying and fretting about so many different things, and to sit in silence at Godâs feet and just to listen. A retreat is simply an attempt to see beyond the 101 cares and occupations we normally have and to ask ourselves, âWhere it is all leading? Whatâs the purpose of it all?â Time to Change takes the basic format and principles of The Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius and allows us to make a retreat without interrupting too much your ordinary daily life and all the things you have to do.",
