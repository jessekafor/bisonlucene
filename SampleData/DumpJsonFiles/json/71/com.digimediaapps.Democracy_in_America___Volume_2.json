    "description": "De Tocqueville was scarcely thirty years old when he began his studies of Democracy in America. It was a bold effort for one who had no special training in government, or in the study of political economy, but he had the example of Lafayette in establishing the military foundation of these liberties, and of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton, all of whom were young men, in building upon the Independence of the United States that wisest and best plan of general government that was ever devised for a free people.            *** QUALITY DIGITIZED BOOKS  ***This Ebook can be placed on the SDCARD with Android 2.2 and above.This is the full length digitised ebook version of a classic book and is supplied by Digi-Media-Apps.
