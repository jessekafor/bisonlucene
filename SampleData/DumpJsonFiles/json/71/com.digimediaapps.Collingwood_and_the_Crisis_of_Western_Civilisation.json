    "description": "This book argues that R.G. Collingwoodâs philosophy is best understood as a diagnosis of and response to a crisis of Western civilisation. The various and complementary aspects of the crisis of civilisation are explored and Collingwood is demonstrated to be working in the traditions of Romanticism and âhistoricismâ. On these subjects, the theories of Collingwood and Ortega y Gasset are contrasted with those of Nietzsche and Weber.Please Note that the book is stored on your phone and you do NOT need a data connection to read it.This is a full-length, quality digitized book.Collingwood and the Crisis of Western Civilisation, by Richard Murphy, is packaged with an easy to use functional book reader which means you can down load the App and start reading.This is a full length ebook version of this title.
