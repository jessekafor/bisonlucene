        "comment": "Huge fan of this on iOS, probably my most played app over several years. Switching to Android recently I was relieved to see this available. Now it\\'s still the best solitaire available but running on my HTC One it just isn\\'t at smooth as the iOS version. I do hope it can be optimized a little more so it matches the overall performance of the iOS version. Still a great title though.",

Issues I have experienced have been on previous comments; eg. after pausing and your screen times out, your cards are all face down.  I\\'ve kinda bypassed this problem by just exiting the game without pausing it first.  Upon returning, it resumes normally.  Still the best solitaire game I have found so far.",

        "comment": "This is simply the best solitaire adaptation I\\'ve seen for Android phones, but there is a small problem.  If you have the game paused and your screen times out or the phone rings, when you get back to the game all the cards will be face down and you will be unable to turn them over again.  You can continue to play, you just can\\'t see what cards you\\'re playing.  There used to be a horrible problem with posted high scores that were impossible to actually get, but the developer seems to have gotten that under control and deserves kudos for doing so, except now the daily and weekly scores never seem to reset.  Same high scores and player names every single day and 400+ scores posted just minutes after the scores should have reset.  It would also be nice if the game included a few of my favorite solitaire games besides Klondike...  Games like Four Kingdoms, Gaps and Limited would be very welcome in this app.",
