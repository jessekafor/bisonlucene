    "description": "The ultimate blackjack app - feature packed and customizable, with multiple blackjack game modes!If you have any suggestions for improvements, please e-mail me - it'll be more effective than just posting \"Game sucks.  Dealer always gets blackjack\".  Regular Mode is a completely realistic blackjack simulator (card order in the shoe is randomized during the shuffle) that provides all the great features of casino blackjack free plus:*Expected Value (EV) calculated live for every play based on the up cards.*Card Counting: choose from 5 pre-programmed systems or create your own!*Customize the rules, # of decks, and when decks are shuffled.*Start a new session anytime from the Stats page.*Lots of stats tracked for both the current session and overall including stats on your double downs, splits, and hand distribution.*New bigger buttons.Cheat Mode stacks the deck in your favor.  Despite what some reviewers seem to think, the deck is randomized in Regular Mode.  However, in Cheat Mode it is harder for you to bust and less likely for you to pull a low card on a double down.  If you'd rather win than have realistic odds, Cheat Mode is for you! (Just don't expect the same results at real blackjack tables!)Sim Mode allows you to prepare yourself for any scenario you may face in a casino.  Its not actually a blackjack game - you can't win or lose bets - but it allows you to see your EV for any possible hand.  Click on either of your cards or the dealer's first card to choose the value of that card and see what your odds are.  Click a card again to change its value.  Not sure if you made the right play while at a casino?  Enter the hand in Sim Mode and find out!X-Ray Mode: Wouldn't you like to have a pair of X-Ray glasses at the blackjack table that allow you to see the dealer's hole card?  Now you can with X-Ray Mode!Responses to selected comments:*Keith - Why do you think the EVs are flawed?  Based on the up-cards showing, every possible scenario is calculated (which is why it can take 1/2 second if you have say 2/3 vs an ace).  I've triple checked them but if you have actual evidence of an error, please send it to me and I'll fix it.*Joel - The number of cards remaining in the shoe and the true count are shown unless you've selected to hide the count.  I may add a relative depiction of the shoe when I get around to a more graphically robust version but I went for gameplay first and graphics second.*Ralph - Yeah, ok.  What possible reason would a game have to cheat you out of play money chips?",
