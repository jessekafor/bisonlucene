One aspect I find lacking is the implementation of contexts. While you can statically include context in a filter for any view, it doesn\\'t make sense to me. I should be able to set my current context globally, and have it apply to all views. Otherwise, seems like a good app.",

Supports pretty much every feature of Toodledo, but also lets you choose which features you want to use. If there\\'s one thing it lacks is a certain style consistent with good UI design (for Android).  It would be nice if one could tweak the widgets and the overall interface more, to make it look consistent with other mods people tend to do (e.g. change font, colours, sizes, margins, etc).",

The second screen shot used to advertise this in Play labelled \\\"All Tasks\\\" (the one with the black background) bears testament to this. If you have a handset with a large amount of [[oh God I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to use this terminology but...]] \\\"real estate\\\" then it\\'s ok, well bearable but if you don\\'t it\\'s just too cluttered and overwhelming. There are too many options on display that do not look related or are there by design.   I came to this software from GTD methodology \\\"Getting Things Done\\\", so a clean looking, slick interface is most necessary. Just take a look at the screen shots for Things\\302\\256 made for IOS (iphone) to see how it could and should be done, then we\\'ll have a winner because the customisation possibilities here are excellent.   (In fact I\\'d recommend people like me that struggle with self organisation read GTD by David Allen as this software is all too easy to get bogged down by using too many options and have no clear path to make the software work for you- as I did first time around.",
