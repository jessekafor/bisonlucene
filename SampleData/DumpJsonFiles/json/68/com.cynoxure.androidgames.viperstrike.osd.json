    "description": "You (and you alone) have been called upon to defend your nation from the onslaught of an enemy attack.   Battling squadrons of air-to-air missile wielding fighters, avoiding surface-to-air missiles, you must engage and eliminate the threats.  Armed with unlimited AIM-120X air-to-air missiles, take aim and fire away.  The enemy air-to-air missiles have only infrared heat seekers, but the SA-12 surface-to-air missiles engage with a radar seeker.  Use your chaff and flare carefully to extend your game.  You must return to your home base to not only claim your victory, but also to restore defensive countermeasures.  You can call an aerial refueling aircraft to extend your mission if fuel is all you need.This retroâstyle game will challenge your skills, and demand a careful strategy to score at a high level.Are you up to the challenge?  Go get âem!",
