    "description": "Come summertime we prepare ourselves for the heat. We have our fans ready, set-up & burn mosquito coils to fend off those insects, play with sparklers at night to celebrate the vacation and hang windbells as we welcome the soothing sounds it gives.So we now bring to you, EcoSummer!EcoSummer is an entertaining app to use in place of those materials. With just 1 application, we have with us our own digital handfan, windbell, mosquito coil and japanese sparklers to use anytime, anywhere.The application includes these 4 materials:* Sparkler - a japanese hand-sparklers to play with. Just swipe the tip and watch as you light up the spark! Just keep holding your device steady, so that sparks will last longer.* Handfan - make use of this digital-fan to blow away the heat. Just hold your device in an upright position and continue by fanning your device up & down, just as you would a normal handfan.* Windbell - \"é¢¨é´(FU-RIN)\" is displayed in the veranda during summer as it chimes when the wind blows by. With this digital-windbell, your device may be used in the same way. If your device get shaken, it will chime! This may also be used as your screensaver.* Mosquito Coil - let's chase those mosquitoes away! \"Katorisenko\" is where the Japanese place their burning mosquito coil to fend away the insects. With this app, it will repel mosquitoes with its high-frequency mosquito-repelling sounds playing in the background.(So that this app may be used for the entire time, Ecosummer does not terminate until user manually closes it.)",
