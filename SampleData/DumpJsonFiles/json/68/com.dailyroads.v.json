        "comment": "This is a great tool.  It is perfect. Current used is high on Nexus 4, so had to purchase a 12v USB adapter rated at 3500ma... My old 1000ma one couldn\\'t supply power fast enough to prevent discharge.  Update 1: Since Android 4.3 this has been less reliable. There are frequent error messages about being unable to save and the app can stall in background mode. Please fix, I love this app. Update 2 - I\\'ve performed a factory reset and this is now more stable. I tend to run WAZE in the foreground with DailyRoads; JourneyLog and Torque OBD II in the background. A lot of work for a little phone - but a really cool combination.",

Only other issue is that it consumes battery even when plugged in, and causes the device to get hot - but that is not really something that can be resolved, especially since I\\'m running multiple apps at one time.",

The second, more significant issue is that it\\'s constantly crashing on my Nexus 4 now and is basically unusable. It\\'s currently refusing to start and fails with \\'unable to initialise camera\\' - even when having restarted the Nexus.  Without these issues I\\'d have no problem giving this 5 stars.",

From the start I\\'ve had an issue with it that my phone (Motorola Photon Q) running this app actually uses more power than the dock can provide, and gets quite warm using it.  I estimate that on a long drive of several hours the phone would end up with a dead battery.  Another issue is the inability to upload to a different web site for storage.  I have my own servers, and would like to FTP copies of the files there, or to a service like Flickr or Photobucket.  The final nail in the coffin is that recently the developer\\'s site has stopped working properly, and no longer seems able to convert files and add overlays.  That part is a paid service, purchased (either as credits or monthly unlimited) within the app.  The failure to deliver what you paid for is considered fraud, and I will be filing claims and complaints against the developer with both Google and Paypal.  No one likes a thief, and charging for something not delivered is theft.",

Once it is setup, it is pretty reliable and does what I need it to do: Record trips in case someone hits me on the road. There are a few minor annoyances/issues which take off a star. [1] The main screen requires landscape view (settings do not), which feels clunky when I open the app to change settings in portrait mode. [2] Latest update caused video recording to fail repeatedly until I reset the data (and settings) for the app. I then had to redo all my configurations. Other than these minor annoyances, the app is well built and now worth a donation (will do soon).",

There are a few things that I would recommend to make this a 5 star app:  1. Make rotation automatic, using the phone\\'s sensors rather than having to manually select the orientation in the settings.   2. Create a better way to silence the beeps between video files. There is a setting for this but it is essentially muting all sounds on the phone which doesn\\'t work for me because I stream media from the phone in the car.  3. Make the overlay buttons even smaller when running in background mode and even better, allow each button to be positioned independently.",
