        "comment": "This app would be PERFECT if it had an exercise tracker. What\\'s daily BURN without the burn?? Pretty good calorie tracker, and the barcode scanner is very cool. The other annoying thing is it doesn\\'t do a good job of telling you if your nutritional stats are in range. It just tells you if you have met your max calories for the day.",
