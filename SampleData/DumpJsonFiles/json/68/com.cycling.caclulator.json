Also, compare different chainring/cog possibilities side by side by the innovative storing of the last 5 chainrings used.  This app supports many chainring, cassette/cog, tire and rim sizes.  This app can save you valuable time and money by trying different gear combinations to setup the bike how you want it.  Newly added, estimations on speed and power.  Estimate your speed based on a variety of configurable variables including power, weight, temperature, elevation, rolling resistance, wind, grade, frontal area drag and efficiency.  Great for trying to estimate times for triathlons and races!  Figure out what speed or power you will need for a specific distance. Even calculates calories and weight loss.Newly added, estimations on speed and power.
