    "description": "This Lie Detector application uses advanced chimerical technology to analyze the way words are spoken in series to determine if someone is being dishonest, or if they are telling the truth.When you need to know for sure, remove all doubt with this Enhanced Lie Detector.This is the original Enhanced Lie Detector Voice app being offered for FREE!This is NOT a fingerprint scanner, but instead actually requires you to use your voice and speak into the device.  When the needle moves to the left, it shows falsehood and when it leans to the right, it shows that the statement has a high percentage of being true. This app cannot really tell the truth from a lie but your friends won't know that! Get a random \"Truth\" or \"Lie\" with each new statement.This app is ad supported to keep it free for you, the user. Enjoy!",
