    "description": "Thermal Diffusivity Calculator is a quick tool to calculate the Thermal Diffusivity of a material which describes the rate at which heat flows through a material.  \t\tThe Thermal Diffusivity of a material is calculated from the thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat capacity of the material. Calculated Values:â¢\tThermal diffusivity (inÂ²/hr)  \t- in Englishâ¢\tThermal diffusivity (mmÂ²/s)\t- in Metric Features:â¢\tA very light weighted.â¢\tA very User friendly Interface. Easy to understand the inputs.â¢\tAll the calculations are done at an eye blink time. Very Speedy Calculator.â¢\tAll the calculations are very simultaneous. If any of the parameter used in the calculation changes, the new result is calculated on the spot.â¢\tA Help Menu. Each difficult concepts are well explained in an easy and diagrammatically way.",
