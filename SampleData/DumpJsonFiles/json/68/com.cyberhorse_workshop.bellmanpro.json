        "comment": "Checked out all the others and found this one to be the best and with the most potential.  Anyhow, now that I purchased it, I hope to see some upgrades coming.  I would suggest more chimes and more voices (male and female).  Also, how about a menu selection capability of changing the pitch and slowing down the voice and a option of saying am/pm like another reviewer suggested.",
