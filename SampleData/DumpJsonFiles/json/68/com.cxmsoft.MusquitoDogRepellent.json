    "description": "â¢ Do you hate mosquitos? This application emit a very unique high frequency sound (ultra sound) that most mosquitos find distasteful and prevents you from getting bitten by mosquitoes.â¢ Note:This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.FAQ:Q: How ultra sound repels Mosquitoes ?A:The theory is that only Female mosquitoes are able to bite us and once a female mosquito has her eggs fertilized she will actively avoid any further contact with the male. In order to to do this, she can recognize the sound of the vibrations from the wing beat of the male which it is claimed is sufficiently different from a females to enable this to happen â thus, upon recognizing such wingbeats the female is ârepelledâ away so as to avoid any further and now unwanted attentions of the male.Q.: Why i'm hearing an hiss? / Why I don't hear nothing?A.: The app plays an high frequency sound. Some people under 30 years old can hear the sound, while over a certain age (variable from person to person) the ear lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds.Q.: Mosquitoes don't have ears, how do they hear sounds??A.: Insects don't have ears, but on feelers, that are the mosquitoes aural organs, there are about 15.000 sensorial receptors, structured so to create an \"active ear\" in which natural vibrations are generated so to amplify the incoming sounds. [Source: Le Scienze on-line]Q.: Are you telling me that the phone loudspeaker can play ultrasounds?A.: Actually the frequency used in Anti Mosquito is slightly under the ultrasounds threshold frequency. But it's very close to the limit that can be heard by the human ear (20 kHz), so for the sake of simplicity we called it \"ultrasound\", because a lot of people can't hear it.",
