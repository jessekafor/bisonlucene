(Before that it wasn\\'t able to start the app reliably.) So that\\'s a trick my fellow Q1 users may like to try. :-) Also works on Blueant T1, but you have to turn off the \\\"media audio\\\" each time the T1 re-connects. I\\'ve been on to Blueant and Cyberon regarding these things, so watch this space.",

        "comment": "I have been so frustrated with trying to do voice dialing, especially in the car. That is the *one* thing my smartphone does not do as well as my ancient Sony cell phone. Back then, I could just record locally, and the phone would reliably call my speed dial list easily. I\\'ve never figured out why one cannot set up personalized variables in Google Now, or S Voice, or whatever.  This app has fixed that problem! Now I can have local recordings for the ones I call most (like my wife). And if I want to switch over to Google Now for more sophisticated navigation, mapping, search, etc., I say \\\"Google\\\" and it activates. And it activates via Bluetooth just dandy on my Galaxy S4.",

After muddling through various products (including Samsung\\'s SVoice) that dismally fail to match spoken contact names against the contact list, finally an app that actually works! I mean it\\'s pretty obvious: create a voice tag on contacts you want to dial handsfree, and of my 300 contacts there\\'s only a handful of those. Still somewhat unbelievable that this isn\\'t a standard Android feature, after all the Motorola phone I used 13 years ago (!) had this built in. NOTE: to hook this up to bluetooth on Samsung GS4 you need to disable the SVoice.",

The recognition accuracy is much better than speaker independent speech rec, since you make a recording (voice tag) for each contact\\'s number to call. It\\'s flexible also. You can apply voice tags to only those numbers you want to call - no more accidental calls to people in your address book who you call occasionally. You can structure the voice tags however you like, for example: \\\"Call John Smith, mobile\\\" or \\\"John Smith, mobile\\\" or just \\\"John\\\". Just be sure you are consistent so you can remember the tags you recorded. Also be sure to follow the setup instructions regarding restating your phone and re-pairing your bluetooth headset.",

        "comment": "FINALLY... a good voice dialer!  Voice Speed Dial actually works!  Some will dislike having to record separate voice tags for every number.  I don\\'t mind -- it\\'s WELL worth it for the precise, reliable , accent-independent, language-independent recognition that it enables.    I\\'m so sick of all the countless worthless SIRI-wannabe apps.  This is not one of those.  It has no pretentions to be a \\\"personal assistant\\\" or any such nonsense.  Just a really good basic voice dialer.  This app is not for phones shared by multiple people.  Not unless you want to record multiple tags for each number, that is -- which may be possible, I don\\'t know, I haven\\'t tried.  IMPORTANT:  The instructions mention that you must re-boot the phone and re BT-pair it with your headset or hands-free kit before you using voice dialing.  Believe it: this really is necessary.  I struggled  until I noticed those instructions, and after that it worked perfectly.  Very minor gripe:  not sure if it\\'s my handsfree kit, or this app to blame.  It beeps to tell you when to begin speaking, and then reads-back what you spoke, to confirm.  In my car, these are so quiet that I can barely hear them.",
