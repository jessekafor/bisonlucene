The breed is found officially in toy, miniature, and standard sizes, with many coat colors. Originally bred as a type of water dog, the poodle is skillful in many dog sports, including agility, obedience, tracking, and even herding. Poodles have taken top honors in many conformation shows, including \"Best in Show\" at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1991 and 2002, and at the World Dog Show in 2007 and 2010.The poodle is believed to have originated in Germany,  where it was known as the Pudelhund. Pudel (cognate with the English word \"puddle\"), is derived from the Low German verb meaning \"to splash about\", and the word Hund in German means \"dog\". The breed was standardized in France, where it was commonly used as a water retriever.The European mainland had known the poodle long before it was brought to England. Drawings by German artist Albrecht Durer established the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was the principal pet dog of the late 18th century in Spain, as shown by the paintings of the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. France had toy poodles as pampered favorites during the reign of Louis XVI at about the same period.The poodle has been bred in at least three sizes, including Standard, Miniature, and Toy. According to the American Kennel Club, the Standard Poodle is the oldest of the three varieties, and was later bred down to the miniature and toy sizes. Despite the Standard Poodle's claim to greater age than the other varieties, some evidence shows the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today. The smallest, or Toy variety, was developed in England in the 18th century. Today, similar to other breeds, there is a teacup poodle, which is not a registered size in most dog registries (CKC, AKC, UKC, etc.).The Toy Poodle is a breed of dog available in Nintendogs and its 3DS sequel. It is also a mascot of Nintendogs + Cats. The pert and peppy Toy Poodle is one of the brightest and easiest breeds to train, as it is the second smartest breed in the world, losing only to the Border Collie. It is alert, responsive, playful, lively, sensitive, and eager to please. Some can be reserved with strangers, some may bark a lot, but they make excellent guard dogs, alerting owners to visitors' arrival. This breed comes in three sizes - standard, miniature, and toy - and has many fur colors, including black, white, rust, brown, gray, and cream.Poodles are retrievers or gun dogs, and are still used by hunters in that role. Their coats are moisture-resistant, which helps their swimming. All of the poodle's ancestors were acknowledged to be good swimmers, although one member of the family, the truffle dog (which may have been of Toy or Miniature size), it is said, never went near the water. Truffle hunting was widely practiced in England, and later in Spain and Germany, where the edible fungus has always been considered a delicacy. For scenting and digging up the fungus, the smaller dogs were favoured, since they did less damage to the truffles with their feet than the larger kinds. So it is rumored that a terrier was crossed with the poodle to produce the ideal truffle hunter",
