    "description": "So, you have your key, but your car says \"Key Not Detected\". Now what?The Dead Key FOB App is Back-up Plan, an instruction utility to get you into your push-button start vehicle and get you underway when the battery in your key fob -- your car's remote control -- goes flat.And it will go flat. Sooner than you will be ready for. Why? Because the very nature of a keyless start system requires that the key fob attempt to be in constant radio contact with your vehicle. The end result the battery in your keyless start systemâs key fob will be depleted in two years or less.- Yes, your dealer can help -- if they are open and you get the right person.- And, yes, the instructions are in your owners manual -- if you can find them. Give it a try! We'll still be here after you've searched through 400 or 500 pages.- Roadside assistance? About all they can offer is a tow truck...- Did you borrow or rent the car??? Be prepared!Is there a standard âhardâ key? Yes, and weâll show you how to retrieve it. And special attention to Audi, Jaguar, Lexus, Volkswagen and Volvo owners: the keyhole is hidden â just to make the car look better! And the instructions to find are now locked in your car in your ownerâs manual!And worse, there is no standard way to start your car. This app will show you: over 30 distinct starting variations (General Motors and Hyundai/Kia use six different ways each, Ford another four while Mazda and Honda/Acura three each!); 13 variations on retrieving the mechanical key, and six variations for getting into your vehicle. They are shown by vehicle manufacturer.-\tDonât get caught in a dark parking lot without this app!-\tDonât borrow or rent a car without this app!-\tDonât give your kids the car to drive without this app!The battery in your key fob WILL go dead, but there IS a back-up plan! And we can help.The app includes text instructions and illustrations for keyless entry and start systems for 13 major manufacturers including: BMW (and Mini) Chrysler (with Dodge and Jeep) Ford (and Lincoln), General Motors (Chevrolet / Cadillac / Buick), Honda (and Acura), Hyundai (and Kia) Jaguar, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan (and Infiniti), Toyota (with Lexus and Scion), Volkswagen (and Audi) and Volvo.The App is a good-faith effort to find every possible option for getting in and starting a push-button start car with a dead key fob. Get it today!",
