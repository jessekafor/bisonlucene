        "comment": "I just bought this pack and it seems that it doesn\\'t work correctly. Not all of my icons have changed when I applied in the menu \\\"Theme setting\\\" the pack. For example the clock application icon didn\\'t change (like on the screenshot) ! So it is pretty ugly because some icons have changed and some others didn\\'t ! Waste my money",
