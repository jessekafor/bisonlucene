The answer is usually Yes because it has very good voice recognition--better than the Choice Dialer I was using on my previous Gingerbread phone. It works well even when I\\'m driving. It didn\\'t work well when I tried it in a noisy restaurant today, but I didn\\'t expect it to. Ice Cream Sandwich on a ZTE Engage.",

This is true for my HTV EVO Design 4g and my wife\\'s Galaxy S1.  To make things more difficult, I use a battery manager to keep my data connection off in order to save battery life.   I use a Plantronics M1100 headset. This app works without a data connection, and about 60% of the time works flawlessly.  40% of the time it is frustrating as hell!  Mis-dials, closes, and simply can\\'t understand me. It\\'s far from great, but does better than most.  Without the ear headset, this app and many others work very well.",

Also it\\'s frustrating there is no demo version and no return after 15 minutes and it took a LOT longer than 15 minutes to realize it has this annoying problem after every reboot.",
