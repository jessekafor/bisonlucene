    "description": "Sea Shooter is an enjoyable and addictive original game.  Sea creatures have been mysteriously trapped in bubbles.  Now suspended in mid-air and unable to move or breathe, they need you to save them!   Use your finger to sling the octopus hero around the screen to knock down all the trapped creatures.  This is the LITE version, which features a sampling of the first 5 levels.  The full version is available for purchase on the market for only $0.99 USD, and contains more levels, along with free future updates for even more levels!BASIC OBJECTIVE:To beat a level, just knock down all sea creatures in the alloted number of shots givenGOOD TO KNOW:** Use the zoom out button to see the entire scene on your screen **** Use the blue arrows to adjust your position before taking a shot **- Only sea creatures of the same type can hit each other after being popped.  For example, if you pop a crab, it will hit only other crabs on its way down-Blocks and other obstacles are made of several different materials and will act accordingly-Some bubbles may require more than 1 hit before they are popped-Earn extra shots by hitting the spinning octopus powerups in a level (if there are any!)OTHER TIPS & TRICKS:- Use the obstacles & walls to your advantage by banking shots and angling to free as many creatures as possible in one turn- The more you take down in one shot, the higher your score!REQUIRED PERMISSIONS:-WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: needed for option to backup/restore game dataSUPPORT:Please send an email to the developer with any bug reports or questions!",
