    "description": "Second generation Voice recognition scanner to lock your phone!Don't worry, the original Voice Lock is still available, but to those of you who want even more, THIS APP IS FOR YOU!Get this ALL NEW voice recognition lock that actually works as a lock screen! Simply run the app and your normal lock screen will be disabled until you exit the app.Invalid identity voices will be denied access to prevent intruders. However when you scan your own voice, you will be granted access quickly and easily.After three failed attempts, the device will APPEAR to go into a permanent lockout mode, however, by pressing the \"unlock\" button one more time the app will return to the first screen. PLEASE READ the entire description to learn how to use this app.There is NO POSSIBLE WAY this app can permanently lock you out of your phone or delete anything. This is a great app to prank your friends with!This app is ad supported to keep it FREE for you, the user.Note! - This app does not actually recognize your personal voice.  It works great as a lock screen, but is great for pranks, jokes, and fooling people. There is a hidden spot that, when touched, will allow access to the phone. After touching the spot ONCE and only once to allow entry, you can speak to be granted access.  I am not liable for any actions involving the use of this app and can not guarantee that no one will be able to access your device while using this app. There is currently no reliable way to make this app actually run on your device by pressing the power/lock button so you can not actually make this app run when pressing the lock button on your phone. This is not a replacement for a real lock screen and is not for security purposes. This app is for entertainment purposes only.  Thank you for using our apps!",
