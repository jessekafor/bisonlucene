    "description": "The U.S. Army Air Defender Application is an unclassified social learning app designed to run primarily on portable phones and other devices running the Android or iOS platforms, but can also be accessed through a standard web browser. The primary goal of the app is to increase Air Defense Artillery (ADA) visibility among top officer candidates helping to encourage them to consider ADA when choosing a placement. Secondary goals include entertaining the player while teaching them about the ADA branch: day to day activities, weapon systems, etc., as well as providing information about the ADA and the army in general to interested civilians.",
