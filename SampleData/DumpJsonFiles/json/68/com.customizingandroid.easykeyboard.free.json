Even better is the fact that i can use it on my phones as well as mini PC with attached standard Logitech keyboard. It accepts normal keystrokes which other apps do not. Simply great in my opinion.

Awesome amazing and free and the ads arent bad but im going to pay to support so you can go on to the big leagues and swiftly kick swift keys behind.  I used to like them but what you offer is better and free.  You can tell which developers care about money and which ones care about the consumer and you are they latter.  People i dont work or know anyone associated with this app, i just believe giving credit where its due,  although you may get for free,  show them you want them around and get the paid version,  which will enable them to keep developing and get better,  and work if it doesn\\'t now, so keep that in mind before giving a bad rating due to uncompatibility.  THANKS KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK!  I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT ELSE YOU HAVE UP YOUR SLEEVES",
