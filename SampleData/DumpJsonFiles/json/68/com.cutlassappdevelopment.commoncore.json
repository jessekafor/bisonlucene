    "description": "Do you have concerns about the Common Core State Standards? Do you find it disturbing that the National Data Collection Model has recommended over 400 data points to be monitored on kids and their families, including health-care history, family income, and religious affiliation? Does the discussion of using data mining techniques, which include functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Mood Meters, eye movement tracking, and smile intensity scoring, as outlined in the Department Of Education, Promoting Grit, Tenacity, and Perseverance document from Feb 2013, leave you uneasy? Have you tried to express your concerns to friends, family, or educators, only to have your concerns labeled as unfounded?  Have you heard Glenn Beck talk about his concerns with the Common Core State Standards, and want to tell your friends, but needed a way to have all the data quickly accessible?  This app brings together a collection of the data gathered through many hours of research, including where the data is quoted from, along with links to the source content, right at your fingertips.The app contains information from sources showing how Common Core could:-utilize data mining techniques-utilize wearable sensors (including the image of the sensors)-provide information on the supporters and funders of Common Core-shift away from classic literature to nonfiction informational texts (example: recommended insulation manuals from the Environmental Protection Agency)-prevent changes or removal of subject matter from the Common Core State Standards; one may only supplement the common standards with additional standards, provided that the additional standards do not exceed 15% of the State's total standards for that content area-much moreThe app has many citations from the actual government documents, such as the US Department of Education, Office of Education Technology Feb 2013 draft on Common Core - Promoting Grit, Tenacity, and Perseverance; Critical Factors for Success in the 21st Century PDF document.
