    "description": "This app was created by DailyOM co-founder, Madisyn Taylor, and offers a simple way to start your day in joy and peace. It features a short but powerful guided meditation in Madisyn's soothing voice, relaxing music and breathtaking nature photography that all work together to help center you in less than three minutes.With our hectic times these days, it is important to start your day off in a good frame of mind.  It is on the days that you are busiest that you should stop and take three minutes to relax and prepare your mind and spirit for the day that lays ahead.  Try not to let the word \"meditation\" scare you off.  You need not do anything special, only listen to the words and music, and if you want, view the beautiful photographs depicting sunrises from all over the world.  Allow yourself to relax fully into the words and images for a few minutes each day and soon you will find yourself looking forward to your mornings.\"The words for the Start the Day Meditation flowed through me one day with little input from my own mind.  When that happens I know that the words have significant meaning and power in their simplicity. I hope you enjoy this simple but powerful meditation to start your day.\" - Madisyn Taylor, Co-founder, DailyOM",
