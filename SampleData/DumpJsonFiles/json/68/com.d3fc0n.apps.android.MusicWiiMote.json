With Music WiiMote, once your Wii remote is paired, you can forget about the hassle and danger of changing the track while driving. All it takes is a button press to change track.Music WiiMote uses Wiimote Controller by C.C.P. Cre@ions to pair with your wii remote. Music WiiMote will prompt you to install Wiimote Controller if it is not found.This app doesn't work on phones with HTC Sense UI and most newer Samsung phones (Galaxy S included)",

        "comment": "Works great on HTC one X. Pairs very easily with my wiimote and works well. One bug is when you go to assign an app to buttons 1 or 2 it force closes and does not assign the app to the button. Also should auto turn off bluetooth on music deactivation in the app. Otherwise incredible!",

I have been looking for some way to remotely control the media in my phone for a long time and now I finally can.  It\\'s a little goofy to keep a wiimote in my car but it gets the job done and is much safer than reaching over to change songs while driving!  I love this app!",

        "comment": "I use my android tablet as a central music player in my house and it is really useful to be able to have remotes in different places to control the player. The only downside is that i have two music players, archoses preinstalled one and player pro, and the app only works with player pro, i dont know if it would work with archoses player if player pro wasnt installed but i havent tried uninstalling it because its not really a problem. I dont see how people can say that its too bulky to have a wii remote because if you have a phone, why do you need a controller and if you have a tablet then its tiny compared to that. One improvement would be to be able to rotate the next and previous tracks because you have to use the remote sideways to make it make sense.",
