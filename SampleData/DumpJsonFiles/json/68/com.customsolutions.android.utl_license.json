What I think really sets this apart from the rest is the customer service. I recently found that I needed to move the app registration from one gmail account to another, and while Google doesn\\'t offer a way to do this, David from Custom Solutions went out of his way to help me accomplish this. Very prompt and professional response to my email. This alone justifies the purchase price of the app.",

        "comment": "This todo app has lots of functionality and excellent integration with Toodledo but it\\'s sometimes a bit frustrating.  First off, when adding new tasks the app doesn\\'t select sensible defaults - for example, in a view filtered by a given tag, if I add a new task I\\'d expect the tag to be defaulted to the tag I was viewing at the time, but it\\'s not.  If I forget to add the tag at task creation then, when I get back to the list (filtered by that tag) the new task isn\\'t there and I have to go to other screens (recently added tasks) to find it and add the tag.  And this is probably my main criticism of this app - more thought needs to go into the user interface, both in terms of presentation (not the slickest looking app) and ergonomic issues like the one above.  The final straw for me was when the developer released a tablet version and asked that I pay again (for what effectively is a pretty minor update to the user interface).  So I switched to 2do...",

Plus the notes that I took that I knew that I\\'d never get back again. Well, I downloaded the app and it was blank. But after a few minutes I saw that I had also purchased the license so I dowwnloaded that and I opened it up and all of my information was still there. I am so happy!  I\\'ve never had a problem with this app at all. It\\'s feature rich and user friendly.You use only the features you want to use. If you need to keep track of your life, get this app!!! The only improvement would be to add an audible reminder. BUT I LOVE THIS APP EVEN WITHOUT IT! I\\'d give it ten stars if I could.",
