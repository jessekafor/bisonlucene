    "description": "Sell your used textbooks to the Camosun College Bookstore using this instant price quote app! It allows you to scan the barcodes of books that you'd like to sell using your phone's camera. You'll find out instantly how much we'll pay you for your used books. Please note: We have tested the barcode scanning feature on many devices, however the camera on some devices doesn't have the resolution to capture barcodes reliably. But, you can always type in your ISBN. Also, keep in mind that we only buy used books at designated \"buyback\" days throughout the year.  Be sure to check our website for the next buyback dates!  This app was developed by CutCom Software Inc. on behalf of Camosun College Bookstore. If you have any trouble, please let us know!",
