You can use stock special effects or create your own using your camera, pic from your gallery or pic you downloaded off the internet saved in your gallery.  So much fun and creativity all rolled into one little app.  This app ROCKS!!!!!!   Thanks developer for coming out with ad free version like I requested - much appreciated.  Tested out app in my Samsung galaxy 4.0 player and it works fine in that device as well.:-)",
