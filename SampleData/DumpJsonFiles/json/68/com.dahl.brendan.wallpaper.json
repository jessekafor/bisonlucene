        "comment": "Just what was looking for! I store all my photos, going back to childhood in Picasa, \\\" so it\\'s nice to see them rotate via wallpaper.   One challenge I ran into is in selecting the albums I want to pull images from. I have a few hundred albums in Picasa and this program selected them ALL. There is no \\\"deselect\\\" function, so I had to uncheck every album I didn\\'t want displayed. It would have been much easier the other way around.",
