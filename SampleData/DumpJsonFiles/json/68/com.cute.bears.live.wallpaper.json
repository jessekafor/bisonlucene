Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the pinnipeds being their closest living relatives. Although there are only eight living species of bear, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found in the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous, with varied diets.With the exceptions of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They are generally diurnal, but may be active during the night (nocturnal) or twilight (crepuscular), particularly around humans. Bears are aided by an excellent sense of smell, and despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they can run quickly and are adept climbers and swimmers. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of fermented fruits, which affects their behavior. Bears use shelters, such as caves and burrows, as their dens: most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of sleep similar to hibernation.Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur. To this day, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, the bear's existence has been pressured through the encroachment on its habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.The English word \"bear\" comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages that originate from an adjective meaning \"brown\".  In Scandinavia, the word for bear is bjÃ¶rn (or bjÃ¸rn), and is a relatively common given name for males. The use of this name is ancient and has been found mentioned in several runestone inscriptions. In Germanic culture, the bear was a symbol of the warrior, as evident from the Old English term beorn, which can take the meaning of both \"bear\" and \"warrior\".The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European name of the bear is *hâÅÌ¥tá¸±os, whence Sanskrit rÌ¥ká¹£a, Avestan arÅ¡a, Greek á¼ÏÎºÏÎ¿Ï (arktos), Latin ursus, Welsh arth (whence perhaps \"Arthur\"), Albanian ari, Armenian arj. The Proto-Indo-European word for bear, *hâÅÌ¥tá¸±os seems to have been subject to taboo deformation or replacement in some languages (as was the word for wolf, wlkwos), resulting in the use of numerous unrelated words with meanings like \"brown one\" (English bruin) and \"honey-eater\" (Slavic medved). Thus some Indo-European language groups do not share the same PIE root.",
