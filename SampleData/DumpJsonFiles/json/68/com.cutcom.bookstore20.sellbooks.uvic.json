    "description": "Sell your used textbooks to the University of Victoria Bookstore using this instant price quote app! It allows you to scan the barcodes of books that you'd like to sell using your phone's camera. You'll find out instantly how much we'll pay you for your used books. Please note: We have tested the barcode scanning feature on many devices, however the camera on some devices doesn't have the resolution to capture barcodes reliably. But, you can always type in your ISBN. This app was developed by CutCom Software Inc. on behalf of University of Victoria Bookstore. If you have any trouble, please let us know!",
