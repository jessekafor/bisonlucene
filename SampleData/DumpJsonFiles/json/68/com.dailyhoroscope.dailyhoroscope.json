The display is only available in landscape, the various components appear overlaid or accross each other, and my birthdate is displayed as one day prior to the correct one. According to the dates, nothing has changed in 6 months. I won\\'t use this.",

It is too big for the screen, even in landscape so you still have to scroll, but without the ability to pinch zoom, you can\\'t use the app. And, there\\'s no widget, which means I have to open the app every day when I should be able to just glance at the screen. Will keep looking for a good horoscope app since obviously the developer has abandoned this one.",

Can\\'t say enough good things about this app. May need to be optimized for phones. But, somehow, I enjoy \\\"Swirling\\\" through it w/my finger; adds to the \\\"Scrying\\\" & \\\"Inner World\\\" experience I derive (& enjoy) from it. Displays birth info one day earlier than registered (fix). But, Numerological calcs still accurate. HTC EVO 4G LTE",

It\\'s easy to keep tabs on friends through Facebook, too. And I love Rick and Jeff\\'s Planet Pulse videos... This app has become the cornerstone of my morning horoscope ritual!
