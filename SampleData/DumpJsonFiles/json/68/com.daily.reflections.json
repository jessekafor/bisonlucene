    "description": "This is by far the simplest application completed by AngelRay Software, and the one we are most proud of. Its simplicity is a thing of beauty. Inspired by eastern philosophy and religion, My Daily Reflections enables users to truly reflect on their lives every single day, even if for a moment. The purpose is to make one or more affirmations or commitments for your upcoming day. You can spend one minute on this or thirty, it is up to you. At the end of the day, go to the reflections settings to view your goals and/or affirmations and then reflect upon them. Did you achieve them? Did you lose sight of or forget about any of them? Why? This is a practice recommended by the Dalai Lama, now on Android.From \"I will try to better my relationship with my employees\", to \"I will not think of myself as worthless; I am unique, important, and beautiful\", this application gives users a simple way to stop and remember. Go back and review past reflections and see how you have grown from this very simple practice.This application does not sort reflections by date, but by the day of your life. What were you think about on the 11,200th day of your life? That was or will be an important moment, as they all are. Acknowledge each day and live in it rather than get through it.For just a moment, stay in that moment. See what you learn.I hope you like the app. It isn't fancy. It may have some bugs, please let us know. If one individual makes a personal connection with their own thoughts with the help of this app, I will consider it worth more money than Reba has.",
