    "description": "Load your own shapefiles with this Geographic Information System (GIS) directly from the sdcard of your mobile device and visualize them over a map. You can also edit the values of its dbf table and use it in offline mode, loading maps from your memory card. With this GIS application, you can select and load a shp file or load an entire folder automatically. You can select one of these shp files and mark it as the active layer and if you do a long press over one of them you can change its coordinate system, its color or make it invisible.The map will display a series of icons, belonging to each of the records in the active layer, which when pressed will allow you to view and edit information from its corresponding attribute table. The application also allows you to view your current position via GPS and center the map on it. You can choose between several online map servers. To use a map in offline mode, simply download it previously (for example using Mobile Atlas Creator (using OsmAnd tile storage format)). You must copy the map to the folder /sdcard/osmdroid/tiles/MAPNAME and it should be in the format /ZOOM/X/Y.png.tileThis is a demo version, some functionalities are only available in the full version.",

        "comment": "Using a Samsung Note 2 and Android ver. 4.1.2. The demo version did not allow me to load more than one layer and it didn\\'t display the single layer that I could add. I can change color and make it visible but it doesn\\'t display the layer on top of the base map. I couldn\\'t find any documentation so that I could determine what I was doing wrong. I\\'m not willing to spend $7.50 for the full app unless I know that it will meet my needs. Other similar apps provide  online documentation. The vast majority of options say something like Sorry that option is only available with the full version. A free 2 week trial of the full version would be helpful.",
