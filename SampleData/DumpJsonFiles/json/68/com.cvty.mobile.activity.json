        "comment": "The always-accessible member card is the only real benefit.  I downloaded this so I\\'d be able to see my HSA balance, but there\\'s no link/access to that.  The doctor/facility directory would be helpful, except the app runs super slow, making me wonder how helpful this will be in a medical emergency.  It\\'s also not intuitive.  If I want to know the closest hospitals, I have to click 10 times just to get to the hospital list, which is under \\\"Specialty\\\", not \\\"Name\\\".  This is backwards.  The first choice should be by proximity.  Also, since I\\'m logged in, the plan type should already be saved in the system, instead of making me figure out what plan I\\'m on.",
