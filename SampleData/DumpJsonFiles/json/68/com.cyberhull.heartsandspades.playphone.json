    "description": "Test your skill and logic playing against computer in Hearts or teaming up with it in Spades!The goal of Hearts is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. You must play a card in the same suit (Clubs). If you do not have one, you can play any card, except that you cannot play a Heart or the Queen of Spades on the first turn, also called \"trick\". The person who plays the highest card of the same suit as the leading card \"takes the trick\" and leads the next trick. The player who takes the trick earns 1 point for each Heart in that trick and 13 points for the Queen of Spades. But if someone wins all the Hearts and the Queen of Spades, also called Shooting the Moon, then that person scores 0 points and each other player scores 26 points! The game ends after any player earns 100 points or more!The goal of Spades is to reach 500 points with your team. Players sitting opposite each other play as a team. The game begins with a round of bidding. You try to predict the number of \"tricks\", or turns, you will win. The combined bids of two partners make a \"contract\". Once the bidding is completed, the partners must fulfill their contract, not the individual bids. You make a contract by winning at least a contracted number of tricks. A bid of Nil means the player will try not to win any tricks. The \"trump\" (or highest value) suit is always Spades. Each contracted trick is worth 10 points. If you fail to fulfill the contract, a penalty is the entire value of that contract. Each overtrick, or taking more than you bid, is worth 1 point and also earns you one \"bag\". Every set of 10 \"bags\" incurs a 100-point penalty. Winning a Nil bid is worth 100 points, failing a Nil bid is penalized by 100 points.----------------------------------------------------------------------â¨Be sure to try other FREE PlayPhone games!â http://bit.ly/YFDSNEGALAXY CHASE: SE => Destroy the aliens!â http://bit.ly/Uq9JLyCASTLE OF SHADOWS => Ultimate Hack & Slashâ http://bit.ly/UhhelKâ¨FARM FRENZY 3 => Frantic virtual farmingâ http://bit.ly/UhhgtRâ¨BINGO LIVE => Play to win!â http://bit.ly/VzGjzh----------------------------------------------------------------------Get the inside connection on PlayPhone games:â¨Facebook ==> http://www.facebook.com/PlayPhoneGamesâ¨Twitter ==> http://www.twitter.com/PlayPhoneâ¨YouTube==> http://www.youtube.com/PlayPhoneTVâ¨Visit our site ==> http://www.PlayPhone.com",
