        "comment": "This is a good apps for learning the major peg system.   Pretty easy to use and understand.  Through having a good keyboard will help.  Has some foibles that need to be fixed.  Nothing major just would make this more fun and easier to use.  On the Real Practice, it would be nice to see where I went wrong when I fail. The game just gives me the score and no clue to what I did wrong?  Another idea to make Real Practice a little harder is make the person wait a time before entering in the numbers.   Allow the person to absorb words/numbers in long term memory rather then short term memory.  With Basic Practice, it would be interesting if after entering words, a person can be tested on the numbers they just entered.  A step up would before the Real Practice.  Also in the Statistics it gives me my aveverage for each number, good.  But it also gives the average for the over 100 numbers which I have never been tested on?   Why not implement that with the Basic Practice.",

        "comment": "Very nice app for practicing the Major System. The only thing I would like to see fixed is a problem when entering the wrong answer on the TF300T using the keyboard. When you press enter it will log it as 2 wrong answers and not one, using up 2 of your 3 attempts. Would give 5 stars if it wasn\\'t for that as I would love to be able to use it on my tablet WITH the keyboard.    Great apps still.",
