        "comment": "Consistent graphics and very great sound effects, wish it had more of a story line like the game players turns into a two minute movie. I just find it annoying the game freezes for my Fusion during this one fight in the Greylands when I reach the allie castle. No arrow lets me finish level one.  I wished the characters interacted more when you tap the character they should talk and the fights sometimes switched angles instead of the side all the time. Please fix the bug!!!!! Lol...if that was true,  I\\'d give it a full five. Make more levels too.",
