        "comment": "All you people are dumb. First off. \\\"Dr whooves\\\" was a fan given name. His real name is time turner. The ones that you keep getting wrong are wrong. A lot of ponies share cutie marks. Prince blueblood and north and south pole all 3 have the same cutie mark. So does photofinish and twilight sparkle. So stop saying this game is bugged. Its not. Mr and Mrs cakes real names are \\\"mr carrot cake\\\" and \\\"mrs cupcake\\\" maybe try those instead of assuming your the one who\\'s right. All the cutie marks on here are right",
