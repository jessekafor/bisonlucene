Although cat ownership has commonly been associated with women, a 2007 Gallup poll reported that men and women were equally likely to own a cat.According to the Humane Society of the United States, as well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade, for making coats, gloves, hats, shoes, blankets and stuffed toys. About 24 cats are needed to make a cat fur coat. This use has now been outlawed in several countries, including the United States, Australia and the European Union. However, some cat furs are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies that are believed to help rheumatism.Cats are eaten in some parts of Asian countries and it is estimated that 4 million cats are killed and consumed in Asia every year. Cats are also consumed in Switzerland, where the consumption of cat meat is not prohibited, in certain rural areas. Additionally, cat consumption can be found in parts of Australia where residents have taken up the practice to reduce the feral cat population.Cats Love with Scratching. Just as with the spraying, cat scratching leaves both scented and visual marks of ownership. Pay attention to where your cat scratches the most. The areas most important to kitty often are related to those places associated with the owner, like a favorite chair where you sit.Cats Love with Kneading. Kneading behaviorsâfront paw treading on soft surfacesâhearken back to kittenhood. Kitten paws knead against the mother catâs breasts to induce milk to be released. Adult cats continue the behavior when theyâre feeling most relaxed and content and loved, and thatâs often when being petted on the ownerâs lap. Kneading is an obvious expression of adoration.Cats Love with Gifting. Mighty hunter cats that catch everything from toys to bugs, mice or frogs, often share the bounty with those they love. Kitties who present you with this bounty deserve praise. They wouldnât bring these special gifts if they didnât love you.Cats Love with Playing. Kittens play out of pure enjoyment, and many never outgrow playtime. Some cats may actually control the interaction of petting by moving just out of reachâso you must go to them. Their most favorite playmate typically is a trusted, beloved companion.Cats Love with Sleeping. As sleep champs, felines typically sleep up to 16 hours a day. Because they are most vulnerable during sleep, the place your cat chooses to snooze must be a secure and trusted location. There is no greater loving compliment than a cat choosing your lap for a favorite sleep spot.Cats Love with Meowing. Cats rarely meow at other cats. Kitty uses these vocalizations specifically to interact with her people. Do you make a point to talk with those you dislike? Neither do cats! Even when kitty pesters you with lots of meows, sheâs interacting with you out of love.",
