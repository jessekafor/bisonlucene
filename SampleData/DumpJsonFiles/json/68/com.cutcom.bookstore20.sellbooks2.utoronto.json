        "comment": "The idea behind this a is great! But it needs a lot of work.. there are a ton of glitches... its like the page never fully loads, so the app just keeps blinking for lack of a better word.. but once it does stop, its great! Its nice to know ahead of time if your book is worth something instead of lugging it to school to find out its only worth 10$ after you spent 100$",
