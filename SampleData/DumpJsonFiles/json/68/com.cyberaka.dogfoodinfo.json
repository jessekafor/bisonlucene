        "comment": "I feed my dog a raw diet of different meats with a vegetable mix, for which, I have researched  numerous sources. This app is often completely wrong and when searching something common, like red pepper or kelp, brings up a bunch of obscure plants that nobody would consider feeding their dog because they have no idea what it is. For your dog\\'s sake find a book on the subject.",
