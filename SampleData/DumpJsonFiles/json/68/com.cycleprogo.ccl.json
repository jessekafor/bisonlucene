        "title": "Super Excited to have a CCL App but...",
        "comment": "Love that CCL finally came out with this app, everything looks familiar and it works. A yearly subscription might be better than a monthly, but i wont say too much about that. My real comment/feedback is: can the developer PLEASE make the buttons bigger for the observation lists and menus??? They are very  slim and i find myself hitting the wrong thing even on my tablet. Thanks!!!",
