        "comment": "I tried a lot of different alarm clocks. At last, I was able to find the application that does almost what I want: 1) Multiple alarm that plays my mp3 files by the number of times, not only by the number of minutes; 2) Customizable chime 3) Individual volume for different alarms. ----  A few things I don\\'t like: 1). The alarms appear in the way they are entered and cannot be sorted. So if I enter a 1:00PM alarm and then 9:00AM alarm, my morning alarm will be under my evening alarm. This is not very convenient for people who change/add multiple alarms often. I would prefer if they are sorted by the order they are going to be activated or by name.  2). The interface is not consistent. Some parts of the program use black and white interface, some are colored. I personally prefer black and white. 3). If I set the alarm with the display disabled, there is no way for me to stop it. This could be a problem with long alarms. I think you should change so that display appears when the alarm sounds and disappears when the alarm is finished. 4). Shake never worked for me, but I don\\'t think I need it.",
