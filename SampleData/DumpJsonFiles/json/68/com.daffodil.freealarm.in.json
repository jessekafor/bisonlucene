    "description": "The weight loss revolution. The patented scientific innovation. Cortisol is what makes you fat. Lose weight and fat by reducing your cortisol - level. Now you can lose weight without diet and diet pills and build skeletal muscle mass without exercise.And \"The Weight Loss Alarm Clock\" wakes you with a wonderful relaxing gentle friendly Tibetan alarm tone. New scientific studies give clear evidence that your morning alarm clock induced stress can affect your blood - cortisol, your weight, your skeletal muscle mass and your health. Even the wake-up call of a conventional alarm clock puts your body under unhealthy stress and a cortisol - peak, resulting in weight gain. The ring tone of conventional alarm clock apps will cause serious health problems. Researchers have linked the morning hours to a higher incident of heart attacks and strokes. Higher levels of cortisol in the bloodstream have been shown to have negative effects, such as: weight gain, depression, pain, suppressed thyroid function, blood sugar imbalances, decreased bone density, skeletal muscle wasting, high blood pressure, lowered immunity, impaired erectile function, menstrual abnormalities, fatigue, chronic pain, headache, migraine, fibromyalgia, muscle pain, poor digestion, oily skin, acne and eczema. Elevated cortisol also leads to wrinkles, sagging, and impaired wound healing. Elevated cortisol in pregnant mothers influences cortisol metabolism during the baby's crucial development periods. Cortisol is what makes us fat, so installing and using this app could be a good idea.Developed by a neuro-scientist, our breakthrough application will redefine the way that you wake-up from your sleep and lose fat and weight. Every night, this app calibrates itself, itâs constantly working whilst you sleep to fine-tune your alarm. You can not make mistakes when you`re using this app. The gentle Weight Loss Alarm Clock removes your morning - stress by waking you up gentle and soft at the most suitable time according to your sleep pattern. The Weight Loss Alarm Clock is a new generation sleep cycle alarm clcok that requires no sensors (worldwide first sensor free sleep cycle alarm clock), in-fact, all you need is your phone by the side of your bed and the alarm clock shall be used conventionally. This innovative, 21st century alarm clock is constantly re-adjusting to your personal sleep habits, looking for the smallest details which it integrates into itâs complex algorithm that it simply uses your sleep information to customize your âwake-upâ experience. The more you use the application, the more accurate it becomes. Connect your phone to power, set the alarm and activate the application - you will feel results on the first morning. Slide your finger across the glass to deactivate the alarm in the morning. A new scientific study (National Research Centre, Denmark) shows that even the wake-up call of a conventional alarm clock puts our body under unhealthy stress and Cortisol. The concentration of the unhealthy stress hormone Cortisol is more than double compared to when you wake up by yourself.In fact, a Yale University study showed that even otherwise - slim persons who are under high stress levels are prone to put on weight on around their abdominal area. Cortisol has been proven to encourage fat storage in the abdominal area. The worst part is if we don't alleviate stress, cortisol levels stay high even when the origin al source of stress has subsided. The effects of cortisol will cause even more fatty deposits to find their way to your middle even when the stress seems to have passed. Obese persons have significantly higher urinary free cortisol excretion.Obese, overweight, corpulent, heavy, huge, outsize?The Weight Loss and Fat loss Alarm Clock is the best way to wake up and the most natural way to eradicate stress, to lose weight, to improve fertility and erectile function and more just simply by starting your day gently - at the best time.",

You would think the app would realize this and go off closer to my alarm time when it realized it was waking me up so quickly.  Nope. Even when it was completely \\\"adapted\\\"it always woke me up exactly 20 min early. And there is no snooze so you can forget laying back down.  Just did not work for me at all!  I do better with my phones installed alarm setup!",
