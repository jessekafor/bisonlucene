    "description": "Qwerty5 Keyboard (Q5KB) is the familiar qwerty keyboard with a twist. It puts all the letters in the familiar qwerty order, but it has just 13 big letter keys. Each key tells you how to type its letters:> To type the large letter, touch the key.> To type the upper letter, swipe up.> To type the lower letter, swipe down.It's a little easier to touch than to swipe, so the designer took the letter frequency of the English alphabet into account when deciding which letters you type by touching & which you swipe. Look at the QWE key. We use E 5 times more often than W & 130 times more often than Q, so E became the touch letter. With the help of 10 digits & a few punctuation marks to stretch things out, 13 of the 14 most-used letters became touch letters. So you touch 83% of the time & swipe only 17%.SAFETYThere is no safer app than Q5KB. For proof, click the PERMISSIONS tab. The warning you'll see when activating Q5KB is the same for all keyboard apps. Only word prediction keyboards collect your personal information.WANT EVEN BIGGER KEYS?There are 3 keyboard apps based on the QwertyX design:> Qwerty4 Keyboard - For small phones, 4 keys wide, swipe 29% of the time, very large keys suitable for people with bad vision.> Qwerty5 Keyboard - For mid-size phones, 5 keys wide, swipe 17% of the time.> Qwerty6 Keyboard - For large phones, 6 keys wide, swipe 12% of the time.ATTENTION DEVELOPERSWould you like to use the QwertyX Keyboard Design in your own keyboard app? It's free for free apps. Contact us.CREDITSSome of the coding of this app is based on the SlideType keyboard by Alejandro Grijalba (in the Market). Q5KB uses the QwertyX Keyboard Design (copyright Â© 2011 by Ernest Ruckle). --------------------------U S E R - G U I D E--------------------------TO ACTIVATEAll keyboard apps must be activated after installing.

        "comment": "Really good idea n effective, except the whole ui design... U can make the keyboard way smaller if u arrange the small letter better. I thought from changing qwerty 6 to qwerty5 will give me smaller keyboard, i was wrong. And so many times i mistaken the number 9 with lowercase g. Why not u arrange them in straight line since it is a swipe down or up function. So it will be more pleasant to the eyes, and easier guide. (htc one user)",

        "comment": "I really like the concept of this keyboard, especially for one handed typing. Without text prediction it\\'s not as fast as other keyboards though. What I would really like to see is a version tailored for one handed typing that is curved from one corner to match up with a thumb. Keep up the good work. Needs an exclamation point.",
