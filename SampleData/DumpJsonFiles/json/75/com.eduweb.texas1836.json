    "description": "Explore the historic site of Washington-on-the-Brazos with this magic window into history.Â See the town of Washington as it looked in 1836, when delegates from all parts of Texas came to write the Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the Republic of Texas. Through the magic of augmented-reality, the app presents a virtual town of Washington, full scale and overlaid on the historic site for you to explore.IMPORTANT: â¢ This app is primarily designed for use at the Washington-on-the-Brazos Historic Site, southeast of College Station, Texas.  To track your location and align the virtual world of 1836 with the real world, you must have an Android phone compass and GPS.â¢ To explore the 1836 town elsewhere, choose the Offsite Tour. This does not require a device with GPS; you can explore the virtual town using the onscreen navigation buttons.Discover the town by walking around the historic site, meeting the people and exploring the buildings as they were in 1836. Toggle between the full virtual world and the augmented-reality view that superimposes buildings and people against the modern environment.Washington-on-the-Brazos, the birthplace of Texas, was a crucible of Texas democracy, the place where Texans gave voice to their grievances, forged their Declaration of Independence and Constitution, and brought forth a new nation: the Republic of Texas. Download the app and see it like never before!Developed by:The Star of the Republic Museum, Blinn College, andWashington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site, Texas Parks and WildlifeApp development by Eduweb, Inc.The project was funded by a grant from the Texas Pioneer Foundation, with support from the Washington on the Brazos State Park Association.NOTE: Due to technical issues, the augmented view does not work on these Android phones. We hope to release an update in the future once this is fixed:-Samsung Galaxy Nexus-Samsung Galaxy W-LG Optimus Thrill 4G-Asus Eee Transformer TF-101-Motorola Droid-x-HTC One X",
