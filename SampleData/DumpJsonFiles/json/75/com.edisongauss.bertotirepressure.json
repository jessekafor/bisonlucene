    "description": "The Bicycle Tire Pressure Calculator is used to compute the optimal air pressure for your bicycle tires. Tires pumped too hard bounce down the road like a basketball, wasting energy. Tires pumped not hard enough are sluggish and prone to pinch flats. Tires pumped just right are at the optimal intersection of responsiveness, shock absorption, and energy efficiency.Popular misconception is to pump a bike's tires to the highest number printed on the sidewall by the manufacturer. Instead, the optimal pressure is that which yields in a 15% sidewall drop. Sidewall drop is a non-linear function of the load on the tire and its width. It can be computed based on the weight of the bike, rider, bags, and gear. It is also different between front and back, depending on the frame geometry.With this App, you can instantly compute the optimal tire pressure from your phone or tablet wherever you may be: in your garage, on the road, at a friend's house.Features:* Enter weights in either pounds or kilograms* Calculate pressures in either PSI or bar* Tire widths from 19 to 60 mm; diameters of 26\", 650B, and 700C; 4 of the most typical frame geometries or user-defined measurements* Configure and save multiple bikes* Tap bike graphic to recalculate pressures",

        "comment": "Tire pressures are a tricky thing, but great things can happen when you get the perfect level of cush and speed.  This app will help you get a good baseline or starting point to make fine adjustments from.  There are going to be some things it can not model like variations in tire construction or accuracy of weight and loading, but it will get you in the ballpark for sure.  After that, the fine tuning is done by trial and error.  A good number of us have been riding our tires at too high a pressure for most of our lives, this app will help you find the path of comfort and speed.",

I\\'m hoping for a few more common bike configurations in upcoming versions. I\\'m curious why there\\'s a custom option but haven\\'t found a way to configure it.",
