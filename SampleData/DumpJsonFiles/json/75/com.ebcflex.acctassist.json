        "comment": "I installed this app a while back and used it and was pleasently supprised at how easy it was. The next time I tried I could not get a picture to attach without the app restarting and saying that my credentials have expired (then I have to log back in and start the claim process again). Each time I tried to attach an image (whether taking a new picture or using an existing image) the same thing happened. I thought that I would just uninstall and reinstall the app but low and behold this app is no longer compatible for my device, well it once was and I liked it but apparently an update changed that.     Incompatible with my Samsung YP-G70 (Galaxy Player 5.0).",
