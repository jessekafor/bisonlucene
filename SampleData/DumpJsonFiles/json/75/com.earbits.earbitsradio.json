    "description": "What is Earbits?Earbits makes it dead simple for artists and music lovers to find each other, and create meaningful connections. Our team of experts brings you the best independent music from around the world, hand-curated and served up hot.  But thatâs not all.  Earbits for Android analyzes the music from your phone and recommends channels youâll like from over 350 genre-based selections, then we intelligently blend your own music into those channels. The result is awesome music discovery with your favorite tracks mixed in.It gets better.  On Earbits, you won't find commercials. You won't find unrelated ads. And you won't find subscription fees.You are also unlikely to find the Top 40 music that you can get everywhere else. That's not what we do. Our job is to showcase high quality music and bring you and our artists closer together.Does that mean I won't hear anybody popular?We're glad you asked. We said it would be independent, but trust us, there's plenty of heavyweights. You'll find Primus, Widespread Panic, My Morning Jacket and other awesome musicians with strong followings. But you'll really know what Earbits is all about when your ears perk up to the sounds of Jesse Thomas, Sister Sparrow & the Dirty Birds, Rosie and Me, or Ivory Drive. If you have never heard these incredible artists, you deserve a better music experience.How can you have no ads, no commercials, and no subscriptions, and still keep the lights on?The reason that Earbits can have no ads, commercials or fees is because our \"advertisers\" aren't your normal radio sponsors. We never got into this to use our bands' music to sell cars and fast food, which is why you won't find those sponsors on our site.We want be the most effective platform for helping high quality independent bands find new fans and turn them into customers. What that means is that the bands are our customers and clients. Rather than doing everything we can to take the focus off of our bands and put it on our corporate sponsors, some of our artists pay for sleeker profiles and increased exposure, and we focus on building tools that help them get real, sustainable value.One way weâve done that is with Grooviesâ¢, the first social currency designed to let users pay for streaming music by taking actions that give value back to artists and record labels.Groovies are a fun and easy way for our users to earn credits for supporting artists. Whether youâre spreading the word about an artist through social sharing, or checking into a live show (coming soon!), if youâre supporting the artists, youâre earning Groovies. Then, you use Groovies to access unlimited on-demand music and Groovie rewards.Simply put, Groovies are the currency thatâs going to change the way people access and pay for music, and itâs going to create massive, sustainable careers for thousands of musicians.So, come on!  Give Earbits for Android a try.(Similar to: Pandora, Last.fm, Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody, MOG, Turntable.fm, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Songza, 8tracks)You'll love us if you're looking for: free music, commercial free radio, music apps, radio apps, independent music, music discovery, and more.",
