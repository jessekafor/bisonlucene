        "comment": "It has many categories and it\\'s good for those who want to learn basic vocabulary from other languages. It runs smoothly on my Asus Eee Pad Transformer. However, it needs some additions especially in the category of buildings; something like school, place of worship, etc. Antonyms category needs more additions as well; the lists are so short. It\\'s not interactive; adding some tools like flash card would enhance its effectiveness. Overall, it\\'s good for tourists and I kinda liked it.",

        "comment": "The darn app quit on me when I most needed it - traveling in other country! It stopped working after I restarted the device and network was not available.   Therefore I\\'m giving it lowest rating. I guess developer get\\'s greedy on licensing, requiring network connectivity to validate license. Guess what - network most of the times are not valuable when one travels abroad.   ---- Developer, please, fix it by removing network-hungry option that causes crashes. People using it while traveling. It shall work reliably for months  even when network is not available! Also, a phrasebook will be nice. Please consider including it.",
