        "comment": "No instructions on how to use this app...had to just try and figure it out.  Once I completed the set up, tried to start the time clock...but I could never get it to work.  I tried it both inside and outside...but to no avail.  I tried to \\\"connect\\\" manually, but kept getting a message that my request was put in que...something that should be automatic and instantanious when I opened the app.  This would have been a perfect app for my company...if only it worked. At least I didn\\'t pay for it.  Would have been helpful to have a list of supported devices right on download page.  Had to go to register page to find that my device was not supported.  The current list is as follows:    A phone with TimeCard downloaded. The following phone models are supported:    -  Audiovox CDM-8940    -  LGE VX4500    -  LGE VX4650    -  LGE VX4700    -  LGE VX5200    -  LGE VX6100    -  LGE VX7000    -  LGE VX8000    -  LGE VX8100    -  Motorola E815    -  Motorola V260    -  Motorola V265    -  Motorola V276    -  Motorola V325    -  Motorola V710    -  Samsung SCH-A890    -  Samsung SCH-A950    -  Samsung SCH-A970    -  Samsung SCH-N330",
