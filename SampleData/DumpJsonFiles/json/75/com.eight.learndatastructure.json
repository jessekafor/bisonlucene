    "description": "Learn Data Structure is learning tutorial. This apps cover all topics of data structure.Data in a particular problem consists of a set of elementary items or atoms. An atom usually consists of single elements such as integers, bits, characters, or a set of such items. A person solving a particular problem is concerned with establishing paths of accessibility between atoms of data. The choice of atoms of data is a necessary and key step in defining and then solving a problem.  The possible ways in which the data items or atoms are logically related define different data structure. It is important to point out that the class  (i.e. c++ class) of concepts dealing with data structures has become increasingly important in recent years.",
