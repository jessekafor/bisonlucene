I would be over the moon to have local multiplayer as in pass phone around. If it had this i would have happily paid \\302\\2435 for it!. But until then ill wait until you actyaly make a game that has no massive bugs, the gameplay of this one ( without terrain faults) and with multiplayer and then i might buy another one of your games until then i think ill pass and save myself some money.",

Do so and you\\'ll get 5 stars but till then, 1 star... Also, be careful when updating as for some reason the app decided to uninstall itself and have lost all generals, upgrades, medals etc! Well done you idiots! You definitely deserve the 1 star now!!!! Shame that the game is good...",

        "comment": "The game its self is a bit less fun then the others and what really gets me is the price for \\'extras\\'  Its $50 to buy 4 top tier generals... that\\'s not even close to funny, that is in point of fact the worst price tag they have yet put in a game. So yea you get one star for dropping the play value and upping the price of what you need in order to finish the game, with out playing the same level 13 times in row. New \\'features\\' like terrain, are really rather pointless. I got a question, why not make a good game and charge a fair price instead of making a mediocre game and trying to rip us off?",

You would have to refight the battles thousands of times to get enough to buy 1 decent general. I did enjoy the game on the first few battles until the opponent became so difficult I had to replay battles for extra cash (I got 1 gold piece every 20 minute battle, not worth it). Unless some major changes occur I dont think I will ever buy another game from them.",
