Enjoy watching these live wallpapers and let it go round! Perfect  live wallpaper for Android!Interactive background-Tap anywhere on the screen and new Earth will appear! Full support for landscape mode and home-screen switching!EarthÂ is the thirdÂ planetÂ from theÂ Sun, and theÂ densestÂ and fifth-largest of the eight planets in theÂ Solar System. It is also the largest of the Solar System's fourÂ terrestrial planets. It is sometimes referred to as theÂ world, the Blue Planet,or by its Latin name,Â Terra.Earth formed approximatelyÂ 4.54 billion yearsÂ ago by accretion from theÂ solar nebula, andÂ life appearedÂ on its surface within one billion years.Â The planet is home to millions ofÂ species, includingÂ humans.Earth'sÂ biosphereÂ has significantly alteredÂ the atmosphereÂ and otherÂ abioticÂ conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation ofÂ aerobic organismsÂ as well as the formation of theÂ ozone layer, which together withÂ Earth's magnetic fieldÂ blocks harmfulÂ solar radiation, thus permitting formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land.TheÂ physical properties of the Earth, as well as itsÂ geologicalÂ history and orbit, have allowed life to persist. Estimates on how much longer the planet will to be able to continue to support life range fromÂ 500 millionÂ years, to as long asÂ 2.3 billionÂ years.Earth'sÂ crustÂ is divided into several rigid segments, orÂ tectonic plates, that migrate across the surface over periods ofÂ many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered by salt water oceans, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to theÂ hydrosphere. Earth'sÂ polesÂ are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of theÂ Antarctic ice sheetÂ and theÂ sea iceÂ that is theÂ Polar ice packs.Â The planet's interiorÂ remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solidÂ mantle, a liquidÂ outer coreÂ that generates a magnetic field, and a solid ironÂ inner core.Earth interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and theÂ Moon. During one orbit around the sun, the Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26Â solar days, or oneÂ sidereal year.Â The Earth's axis of rotation isÂ tiltedÂ 23.4Â° away from theÂ perpendicularÂ of itsÂ orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface with a period of oneÂ tropical yearÂ (365.24 solar days).The Moon is Earth's onlyÂ natural satellite. It began orbit aboutÂ 4.53 billionÂ years ago. The Moon's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates oceanÂ tides, stabilizes the axial tilt, and gradually slows the planet's rotation. Between approximatelyÂ 3.8 billionÂ andÂ 4.1 billionÂ years ago, numerousasteroidÂ impacts during theÂ Late Heavy BombardmentÂ caused significant changes to the Moon's greater surface environment.Both theÂ mineralÂ resources of the planet and the products of theÂ biosphereÂ contribute resources that are used to support aÂ global human population.Â These inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independentÂ sovereign states, which interact through diplomacy, travel, trade, and military action.Â Human culturesÂ have developed many views of the planet, including itsÂ personificationÂ as a planetaryÂ deity, its shapeÂ as flat, its position asÂ the center of the universe, and in the modernÂ Gaia Principle, as a single, self-regulating organism in its own right.",
