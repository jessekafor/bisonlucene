        "comment": "I love this app, been using it for nearly a year in Toronto and their bixi system. The new update made it easy to see how many bikes are available on the map view without needing to click the station. Only fault is that if that station doesn\\'t have any bikes it doesn\\'t show the station at all. I understand that you don\\'t need to know about that station if you need a bike so it shows ones that have some, but I use the app plenty enough of times to see if there are stations with any spaces for the bike I\\'m riding. Usually I know the stations around me but sometimes I go to an area I don\\'t normally use so it\\'d be good to know that the station does exist for me to unload the bike.  You can switch the view to the older red circles and dots, which I\\'ll probably be doing for the time being. So it\\'s not a huge loss.",

It kept my old favorites, too.    However... Why on Earth does spotcycle need the \\\"directly call phone numbers\\\" permission?? The change log should mention this.  This must be a bug, right?  Also...  A feature request for the new version of Spotcycle:  Can you please bring back the feature of having the favorites list be the first thing displayed when launching the app?  In the new version, I have to tap the menu, tap favorites, tap List view, and then tap my only favorites group.  Any chance a preference or setting can be built in to set the default screen to not be the map of all stations everywhere?  I would assume that the vast majority of users are ones who are regular riders and only care about certain stations, hence the awesomeness of having the favorites screen...",
