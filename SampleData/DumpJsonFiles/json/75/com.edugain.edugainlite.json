    "description": "EduGain Math Practice offers an assessment infrastructure that focuses on helping a child understand the various aspects (categorized by class and topics) that are relevant to their age. We are starting our service by providing this infrastructure to students of class 4 to 10, but will be expanding to provide this for other classes too. We provide the ability to generate randomized questions of various types. EduGain uses an advance software engine that generates questions and answers randomly - it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll never see a question repeated.",
