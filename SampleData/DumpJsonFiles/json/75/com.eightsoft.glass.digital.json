        "comment": "Loving all three digital clocks. Analog is basically JB 4.2 style. LWP\\'s are very clean and not too busy. Would be nice If LWP\\'s and clocks had some customizability. Would also love if widgets could work on lock screen too. I like my LS & HS to match. 5 stars if any of these are implemented. I LOVE the static wallpapers!!!!!",
