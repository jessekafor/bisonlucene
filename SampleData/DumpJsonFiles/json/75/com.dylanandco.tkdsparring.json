        "comment": "Round end sound could be something a little more realistic, like a bell. See Aces boxing round timer in play store for ideals. Could use video link in forms and which rank each is for, for those new to these forms, you know ever school doesn\\'t use the same forms. Text to speach could use some adjustment settings if possible, talks a little too fast.",

        "comment": "Viewing referee deductions very important and needed. Every 2 kyongos (warnings) a point auto adds to opponent.. Every Kamchung (full point deduction) auto adds a point to opponenent. Any combo of deductions totalling 4 point infractions ends the match in disqual and opponent wins. Displaying deductions is very important",
