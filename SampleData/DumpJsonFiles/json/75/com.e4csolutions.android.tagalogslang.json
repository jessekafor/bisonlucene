    "description": "Take your Filipino/Tagalog to the next level with Tagalog Slang.  This is a dedicated phrasebook that will teach the user to say and quickly recognize common phrases in a myriad of lifeâs situations: hanging out with friends, going to gatherings, the ever popular Filipino âchismisâ (gossip) talk, and pop culture sayings (stuff youâll hear with friends and in Filipino movies all the time).  A lot of the phrases youâll find in this app arenât usually taught in books and classes.  Most may learn these phrases in bits and pieces only through interactions with their Filipino friends.There are almost 650 total phrases and 60 essential words spread over 3 categories.  This dedicated phrasebook expands on the 250 item sentences section found in our highly rated sister app Conversational Tagalog.  While Conversational Tagalog teaches the beginner a proper way of using words to form sentences, everyday conversations in any language consist of phrases and sayings that may not mean what is said literally.  For example, âwait a secâ doesnât mean that you want the listener to wait exactly one second.  It can mean that you are busy at the moment and you will get back to them as soon as you can.  Or, it can signal that there is something that was spoken that will need clarification.Those new to the language will get a quick primer on phrases that would normally fly right by them.
