        "comment": "It used to work good on my old but still useful HTC Wildfire, albeit the bottom of the screen was not visible, but since I switched to a new phone (Huwei Y300) I found mediocre results. GPS and speed are working fine but the stroke rate is way off and annoying. Rowing at 28 spm it shows  stroke rates ranging from 14 till 42 I\\'ve repositioned the phone, tried different. setting all to no avail I mailed the developer but haven\\'t heared a possible fix.  If it is working on your phone then it is a marvellous app but be aware that it can be disfunctional on some phones without hte developer helping.",

        "comment": "Works just like an nk stroke coach  Used it today with 6x3 minutes coxing a quad took the rates spot on just held the phone by the shell and it felt the rock and took perfect readings  Also even just great for a timer of pieces  Also took the speed well and took down the length we rowed  At the end seeing 1556 strokes was another great thing  To be honest I would use this over a stroke coach but probably unless you have a water proof case and a stand in your foot stops it would be best off with the cox.",

        "comment": "I\\'ve tried this app in a 20k outing and it worked brilliantly (I was stroking our club\\'s 8-Yolle and it really helped me to have a feel of what the stroke rate should be!). Having the data exported to be later analysed is also a great thing.  Haven\\'t tried the \\\"social\\\" feature because not many rowers know about this app (yet!).  Pity that the battery life on my phone is terrible, otherwise this could actually replace a more expensive NK stroke counter! :)",

The distance measurement seems almost 100% accurate (I measured against a buoyed 2000m course).    I\\'ve also been using the speed measurement to help gauge my power application and the heart rate indicator to tell me when I\\'m in my aerobic and anaerobic zones.  I haven\\'t used the map function that much, but as more rowers start using BoatCoach I expect this will be really cool for races.  Overall, thanks, great app!!",
