The tower rises 300 meters tall (984 ft); when it was completed at the end of the 19th century it was twice as high as the Washington Monument, at the time the tallest structure in the world. It was built for the World Exhibition in 1889, held in celebration of the French Revolution in 1789.The man behind the famous Tower was Gustave Eiffel, known from his revolutionary bridge building techniques, as employed in the great viaduct at Garabit in 1884. These techniques would form the basis for the construction. He was also known for the construction of the Statue of Liberty's iron framework.Paris's most recognized landmark has three floors. The first is at 57m, the second at 115m, and the third at 276m. The top of the aerial is 320 m above the ground. On a clear day, you can see from the top of the platform, the whole of Paris and the distant suburbs. During the night, you can see the tower dressed in a warm glow of 336 light projectors and 20,000 sparkling strobe lights, and you can enjoy the cool evening breezes from the towerâs observation deck and get a glimpse of floodlit bridges, churches, and other landmarks in the glowing Paris. With 7 million visitors in 2011, the Eiffel Tower is also the most visited paid monument in the world and the most famous site attraction of France.Ads information:=============This app is ad supported.
