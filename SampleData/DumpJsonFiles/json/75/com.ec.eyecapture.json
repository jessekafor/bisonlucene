    "description": "** For best results, be sure to align the corners of the magazine pages with the corners of the Eye Capture camera viewer using the yellow arrows as a guide *** What we do* Eye Capture is the ground-breaking mobile solution for magazine readers and the publishing industry. Eye Capture ties together the printed page and the internet using innovation and technology, and acts like QR codes on steroids, only without the QR codes, hidden codes, or any codes. We keep the focus uniquely on the reader and print magazine.We work directly with magazines to Eye Capturize their pages. Check our website at ** www.eyecapture.net ** for participating magazines, and for samples to use to try out our app.With Eye Capture, you take a picture of the entire page and are presented with an screen full of images and magazine-approved links of content thatâs directly related to whatâs on that page. Now you can visit product websites, watch a video or two or three, Like them on Facebook, follow them on twitter, and yes, even buy the product, all from the capture of just the single page. All without having to search for it on a browser, or dig through confusing websites on your iPhone or iPod. Those little square codes can only show you just one of these options. And unlike other programs, the content is magazine-approved, so you know itâll be great. When you discover something new, you can share it with your friends on Facebook, twitter, through text messages, and email!We work directly with magazines and weâre new, so please be patient with us as we grow. Visit our website for samples to try out our app (print out samples or capture the screen). And if you have a magazine that youâd like to have Eye Capturized, please let us know!You can experience Eye Capture even if you don't have a magazine that is activated.http://www.eyecapture.net/try-it-here.html",
