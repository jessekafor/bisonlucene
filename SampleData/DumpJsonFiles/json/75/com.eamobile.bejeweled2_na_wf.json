I also got a BT mouse to play it with because she plays the PC version that way, but this version won\\'t allow playing the game using it.   The FREE Bejeweled Blitz allows both unconnected play and BT mouse use. I wonder if the developers can change these behaviors so she can enjoy her game the way she is accustomed to playing it. Here\\'s hoping for an update soon!",
