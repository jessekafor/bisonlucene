        "comment": "The game is listed as compatible with the Nexus 7, but it doesn\\'t fill the screen, nor respond to any keystrokes. Really disappointed, have always enjoyed and extolled the virtues of Easy tech games, but this offering on the tablet is a dud. DO NOT BUY FOR THIS PLATFORM!  Have played the game as Panzer Elite on the iPhone as and it is fine, as a re-badged Panzer War (not on unresponsive menu screen) it just doesn\\'t function. Waste of money, if only I\\'d attempted to play it within the 15min refund window!",
