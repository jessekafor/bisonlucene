        "comment": "Reminds me alot of Axis & Allies (Favorite game ever)! Only big complaint is the AI - it has no idea how/where/when to do what ;-) IMHO A mode where you could play without any AI on your side would be great!! Make it so their units are player controlled.  Also the map glitch where it wont scroll or let you buy/interact with units is annoying but easy to get around.",
