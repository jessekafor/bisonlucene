        "comment": "No option to not include the transaction fee in money codes. I always have to add $1.75 to each check before I issue it. It\\'s SUPER SLOW! Sometimes it\\'s super fast but never when I need it to be. Fix the money code fee and better rating from me. Once a money code is issued, there\\'s no way to text it to a driver or send it via email. I have to get my pen and paper out anyway! Useful while on the go but time consuming....better to just call the number and follow the prompts since  Ineed a pen and paper regardless.",
