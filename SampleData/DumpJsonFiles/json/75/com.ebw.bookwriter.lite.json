It does everything it says it does... you can write a full book by making like 30 four page books, but the app fails to emphasize you that only four pages are allowed in each and that you can\\'t even export your book without going to pro... this app is extremely glitchy and laggy, so I\\'m scared to go pro because I\\'m scared that it\\'ll be the same. This app is more for like a grocery shopping list. This app needs some major improvements",
