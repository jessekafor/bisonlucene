        "comment": "I have two VZW Galaxy Nexus phones, the app works great on the phone running 4.1.2.  However, on the 4.2.2 phone the \\\"Login\\\" button is not functional.  I tried to pull a logcat at the same time, on the 4.2.2 device but there weren\\'t any relevant entries in the log.  I hope there is an easy fix for 4.2.2, the app is much nicer to use than the mobile website.",
