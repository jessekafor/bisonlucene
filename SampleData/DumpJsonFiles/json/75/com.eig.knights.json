        "comment": "Hands down the best turn-based strategy game I have ever played, and I\\'ve played well over 50. The different unit types, the skill involved, the overall art work and the controls makes this game great...but what sets it apart and makes it the best turn-based strategy game ever, is the fact that you build and construct intricate fortresses which I\\'ve never seen in this genre before. PLEASE ADD ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!!!!!!!",

Good news, they are. If you like turn based strategy games, try this game, you will be impressed.  Developer: I didn\\'t rate this at 5 stars because I think it needs to be sped up some and there needs to be more options in setup: ie speed controls for game and tilt, volume, etc. Also, I am fundamentally against in app purchasing.",

        "comment": "(A) it seems sorely misbalanced. The second level is insanely difficult without more gold and the only way to get gold at that point is to participate in clicking online \\\"offers.\\\" i would rather have IAPs than \\\"offers.\\\" (B) When pressing the Back button in a mission it leaves the mission without warning, losing any progress (done that twice by accident already). (C) The click zones are a tiny bit too small, making it tricky to click on the right unit. (D) It has locked up on me a couple times during the enemy\\'s turn on the second mission. (E) Add a tutorial - most of the in-game UI is not all that intuitive (the icons seem ill-chosen to me). (F) add 1 MP to the units - only being able to move 2 dots per turn gets tedious. i love the theme/graphics, and would love to see this game given a bit a polish, but can\\'t see myself playing it much as-is.",

The objectives aren\\'t always clear, nor why you lost a particular battle, but with some patience you can figure things out. The user interface could definitely use some work, as things like current HP of an enemy is only shown during their turn, and tapping on the right spot can be tricky. But regardless, I feel like it was worth the money and am enjoying it.",
