    "description": "European War (musket & artillery) is a new style strategy game for Android(like Risk). It takes you to battleground Europe during the eighteenth century and nineteenth century. In this game many tactics been used in order to defeat the other forces. You can select six empires: British, French, Ottoman, Russia, Germany and Austro-Hungary in this age. If your army conquest enemyâs territory your total tax revenue will be improved. You would get all of the empireâs Territories and improve yourself total tax revenue after your army conquered enemyâs Capital. Tax can be used to purchase cards (Draft Card, General Card, Marshal Card, Ship Card, Fortress Card, Cannon Fire Card.)   A large number of real historical elements ensure the quality of the game, while the card system greatly improved playfulness and interesting. The game is no longer the same as the previous board strategy game by selecting the command to determine the strategy, but achieve the effect via the cards and dice. Firstly, in order to simplify the operation, secondly is to use a more flexible and relaxed approach to the interpretation of the essence of war. While the game is full of smoke flavor, but the ultimate aim let players relax, reduce stress, and therefore regard the strategy and the screen as important, and strive to excellence in these two sides.FEATURES: -Include five difficulty levels. -Include 6 common cards and 6 empireâs special cards. -Include two mode: CONQUEST MODE and BATTLE MODE. -CONQUEST MODE: select one of the six empires to defeat other empires. -BATTLE MODE: select six campaigns (Battle of Toulon (1793), Battle of Marengo (1800), Battle of Austerlitz (1805), Battle of Tannenberg (1914), Battle of Galicia (1914), Battle of Gallipoli (1914)) . -72 Territories (include sea and capital) every territory has its taxation. -Extend risk style battle mode (easy, various and interesting). Comfortable operation makes you play this game easier and have more fun.Note: This game requires that the device has high graphics performance, some Android devices without GPU,such as HTC G3, may not run this game smoothly.",

I would increase my score for European War if full screen for tablets was available and there were ways of speeding up the game-play.",
