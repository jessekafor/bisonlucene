        "comment": "YAY!!! They finally added the widget to the lock-screen! I\\'ve waited so long for this. Seriously, this makes the app pretty much perfect for me. I have Google Music, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Tune-in, Songza, Slacker, and Pandora, but I use 8tracks just about every day over the others. It\\'s easy to use and has a cool UI. Thank you so much!",
