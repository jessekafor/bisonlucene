        "comment": "The only things keeping me from 5 stars are: 1. The guy jumps even if his head is the only thing touching the pad. 2. Sensitivity is a bit high; maybe customizable. 3. The excessive ads.get annoying. Especially when the automatically redirect me or pop up twice after.I close the first. Otherwise, great app! I look forward to playing more apps made by Hammel!",
