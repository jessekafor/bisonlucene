        "comment": "Very original concept and setup, but even hard mode is pretty easy.  There should be more deniers and insurgents and emissions should be harder to lower.  I like the way it makes emissions \\\"lag\\\", so that your levels from 20 years ago cause problems in the current year.  Its slick interface gives you lots of ways to use your agents without overwhelming you with details.",
