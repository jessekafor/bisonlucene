        "comment": "I just cant praise this enough have been using with kids last 2 years & this app has been constantly updated with more & more features & content to keep kids playing with it. Once kids learn enough you can switch to question mode where the kids are asked to choose from 4 flash cards, nice concept of teaching kids. The latest version is quite big in size but lets you move the app to external sd card. There are buttons to navigate or you can use swipe mode (settings) to manually change the image, kids find it easy using the finger.",

        "comment": "I just downloaded and looked through all the categories. This is the app I\\'ve been searching for!! I love the swipe mode, easy for my toddler who is already used to swiping on phones/tablets. I like that it is real pictures, not cartoonish images. The voice/ sound is good and appropriate for toddlers. (Some apps I\\'ve tried have had creepy men\\'s voices or strange music.) I also like that every category is in alphabetical order so that the child is picking up their ABC\\'s in all categories, not just the ABC category.  Some reviewers complained about the ads, but it is just a small bar across the bottom of thescreen. I\\'m not bothered by this. I suppose if the ads really are bothersome, you could just pay a couple bucks for the ad-free version. This app would be worth the money if the ads bothered you that much. My criticisms are minor: the flute flashcard actually shows a picture of a recorder, and a few things are not toddler appropriate (take candy out of the food category because I don\\'t want my 2yo thinking it is legitimate food, and why does a toddler need to know about frying pans or blenders, etc.) Overall I\\'m impressed with this and am excited to see my child learn from it.",
