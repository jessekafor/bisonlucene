The religious Eid is a single day and Muslims are not permitted to fast that day. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of Shawwal. This is a day when Muslims around the world try to show a common goal of unity. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality. However in most countries, it is generally celebrated on the same day as Saudi Arabia.Eid al-Fitr has a particular Salat (Islamic prayer) consisting of two Rakats (units) and generally offered in an open field or large hall. It may only be performed in congregation (Jamaâat) and has an additional extra six Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying \"AllÄhu Akbar\", literally \"God is greater\"), three of them in the beginning of the first raka'ah and three of them just before Ruku' in the second raka'ah in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam.[4] Other Sunni schools usually have twelve Takbirs, seven in the first, and five at the begining of the second raka'ah. This Eid al-Fitr salat is, depending on which juristic opinion is followed, Fard (obligatory), Mustahabb (strongly recommended, just short of obligatory) or mandoob (preferable).Muslims believe that they are commanded by God, as mentioned in the Quran, to continue their fast until the last day of Ramadan and pay the Zakat and fitra before offering the Eid prayers.Features:=> True HD Wallpapers.=> Gallery View of all Wallpapers.=> Smooth Wallpaper Changing.=> Set As A Wallpapers.=> Save To a SD Card.=> Free And Always Will be.=> Can Work Offline Once Picture is seen.This app will add a few icons and push notification on your device.
