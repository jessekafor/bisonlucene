    "description": "This is for students in High School/College learning algebra. If you are a beginner in algebra you might be thinking X+Y=XY, Is not it? But itâs not. The beauty of algebra is, it deals with variables, expressions & equations. You will come to know various formulas.For example if you know (a+b)^3= a^3+b^3+3a^2b+3ab^2.You can calculate any number to the powers 2,3,4â¦in a fraction of seconds.In the above equation a ,b are variables. So you can calculate (1.034)^3 also using that formula. Just feed a=1& b=.034IMathPractice Algebra's 3 steps method of teaching has sections like Tutorial, Practice Skills, Practice Test & Algebra Challenge. Under tutorial it teaches you.NumbersTypes of Number like real number, integer, negative number, complex number Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division of Real NumberAddition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division of Negative NumberAddition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division of Complex NumberProperties of NumberRatio & ProportionExponent & RadicalInteger exponents/real /rational exponentsRational exponent is radical.What is Monomial/binomial/polynomial?Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division of polynomialsFactoring polynomialWhat is variable, expression & equation?Linear equation, Quadratic equationEquation with radical, Absolute value of equationRational Expression;Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division of rational expressionWhatâs Inequality?Linear, Polynomial &Rational InequalitiesAbsolute value of InequalityUnder Practice Skills, You will be able to practice all the above learned skills with help.There are answer & steps to get the answer for each question.Under Practice Test, You will be able to practice all the skills in specified timed environment. There is a timer. You need to finish within that time.Under Algebra Challenge You will be prepared to compete with others. It contains 50 questions & time allotted is 1 hour. We will display each month champions/winners selected from around the world of this challenge in our website imathpractice.comThere are around 210 questions to practice for in lite version.What's new in version 1.3?Bug reported in comment section has been removed.",

        "comment": "This app is great in many ways. The tests contain a balanced mix of questions, from simple to challenging. However, once you\\'ve reached 40% of the total, a msg appears to tell you that you\\'ve passed. This msg covers the end of the questions, slowing you down and making some questions impossible to answer.",
