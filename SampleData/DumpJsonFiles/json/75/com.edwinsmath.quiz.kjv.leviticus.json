    "description": "Author â MosesTime â 1,500 B.C.Summary â The third book of the Pentateuch takes its name from one of the 12 sons of Jacob, Levi, whose family was chosen by God to act as priests and assistants in the Tabernacle. The book covers the national and personal laws given by God to the Jewish people regarding worship and religious activities. It contains laws regarding cleanliness, morality, ethics and hygiene which guided the Jews on a dayâtoâday basis and still does today. Animal sacrifice was introduced as a covering for the individual and national sins of the people",
