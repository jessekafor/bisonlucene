        "comment": "I\\'ve run into a bug a few times after hitting the point where the pass line bet becomes part of the odds bet placed on next point set,leaving only an odds bet. Seems to happen when the second point is 6. If you then attempt to remove the bet before the point hits or a 7 comes,the entire amount is removed and you cannot continue. The game correctly won\\'t let you add a pass line bet when a point is already established,but also won\\'t let you roll even if you had other bets up. More to add,but out of space.",

I rolled 7, 7\\'s in a row, then came out on a 6 and on my second roll hit a 7. I haven\\'t once rolled more than 5 times toward my point without hitting a 7. Not once. In fact you\\'ll be lucky to get 4 rolls toward your point before a 7 lands. THIS APP SHOULD BE CALLED BLOWS. Cuz crap is to kind.",

        "comment": "Good simulation overall but nothing really stands out. Could use custom user-defined betting amounts.  This will solve repetitive dragging and dropping chips and streamline gameplay. Also, the slider bar for setting money is annoying. It is imprecise.  Should just add direct text input from keyboard. For example i try to set starting money to 200 but cant ever make the slider stay on 200 i always end up with an odd number a little more or less than 200.",

Want to really like it, but I can\\'t get more than 2 rolls past the point without a 7 popping up.   The controls are a little difficult, the bet placement needs to be the whole zones, particularly on odds bets. Nicely done, just need to fix logic and tweak interface.",
