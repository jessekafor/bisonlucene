        "comment": "This app seems pretty authentic. It tests you very well with logic, math, etc problems. Also, like the other poster says, it EXPLAINS WHY you got it wrong. My only real gripe is that some of the explanations are open for interpretation: for instance, which is the odd one out? Lake, Stream, River, Canal? I put canal, because it is the only man-made structure, but no, the answer is lake because all the others are FLOWING.  So I get marked down, even though I am right. It seems very wrong to me that someone can be marked down because some test doesn`t get the answer it wants even if the answer is actually correct. Is this how all IQ tetsts go? Because it means that a smart person who doesn`t understand the culture will be given an IQ of 10 and look like an idiot.  Something to think about. That said it`s pretty correct on most other stuff and was very annoyed to get only 110 which makes me average. But i guess I just got to keep training my brain and improve. Good App. 4 stars.",

However, the primary reason I gave it a \\\"5\\\" was the feedback it provides after each test - well done!  It doesn\\'t just give you the answers, but reminds you of the original questions, tells you the difficulty level of each question and provides complete explanations of how you should have arrived at the correct answer.  (i.e., even if the results are not accurate, you\\'ll still benefit from the feedback and become smarter anyway.)  So, if the old saying \\\"if a survey is only as good as the guy who wrote it\\\" is true, then this developer is pretty sharp as well.)",

Another flaw would be cultural difference between who wrote the test and whonis taking the test. Most americans don\\'t consider a cow to be a pet etc. I don\\'t think the writer is english speaking by first language so there are discrepancies found and problematic translations as well as meanings conveyed being skewed.\\tI\\'m not sure if there are issues with some of the programming and how certain answers like the mirror issue can come up (the mirror image contained no dot that the original image had in question), or if the writer of the test overlooked details, but I would take your test results with a grain of salt.
