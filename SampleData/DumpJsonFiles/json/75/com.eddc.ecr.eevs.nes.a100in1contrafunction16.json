And please enjoy!The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit video game console that was first released by Nintendo in Japan in 1983 as the Family Computer (ãã¡ããªã¼ã³ã³ãã¥ã¼ã¿ FamirÄ« KonpyÅ«ta?) (also known as the Famicom (ãã¡ãã³ã³ Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC), being released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (íë ì»´ë³´ì´) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Family Computer/Super Nintendo Entertainment System.The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983, and set the standard for subsequent consoles of its generation. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute software for Nintendo's platform.In 2009, the Nintendo Entertainment System was named the single greatest video game console in history by IGN, out of a field of 25. 2010 marked the system's 25th anniversary in North America, which was officially celebrated by Nintendo of America's magazine Nintendo Power in issue #260 (November 2010) with a special 26-page tribute section. Other video game publications also featured articles looking back at 25 years of the NES, and its impact in the video game console market.",
