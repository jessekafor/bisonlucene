Anyway, as to the app, it crashes a ton for me and since i download new apps all the time I\\'m having to always put in the password whenever i want to get on something, which makes me just give up on my phone for a bit at times. My phone also freezes a bunch  which i think is a result of this app, plus it takes a lot of my battery power.",
