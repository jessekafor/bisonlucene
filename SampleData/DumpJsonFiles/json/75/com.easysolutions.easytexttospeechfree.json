Thanks.Enhance Text To Speech reader application that is simple, effective, flexible, intelligent and highly productive. With the aid of the notification status bar icon, active Text To Speech processing can be stopped, edited, modified and restarted. Alternatively, just copy new text to the clipboard to interrupt Text To Speech processing with the new task.Just what you have been waiting for. I wanted this functionality for myself and had to write my own application to get it. This is because the older APIs can not easily accomplish a satisfactory clipboard monitoring solution. Well now I can share this solution with the world and hopefully some of you out there will have a requirement for such an application and appreciate what this application delivers.Requires prior installation for support of an Android TTS engine. March 2013 Notification: The Trial Evaluation Version restrictions will change towards the end of May 2013 (for all App versions past and future). Allowing less time to evaluate the App before more restrictive functionality measures are applied. The App will still function, although all text processed will be polluted with 'End of Trial...' warning messages. The reason for this change is to try and generate some return for the significant development time invested to date, as this is not much of a hobby. You probably spent hundreds on a device, yet fight very hard not to spend a small amount on a useful App. Please support by purchasing the paid version.In the event of a serious show stopping software problem (crash after an update, try reinstalling) then please email EasySolutionsGlos@gmail.com directly to help identify and fix as quick as possible. Apologies in advance.Thank you for your support.",
