        "comment": "I thought this app would have some component of learning but it is purely quiz based... learning by repetition. I thought it would be cool to introduce some new things to my son in fifth grade but the questions are fixed and there is not even an explanation offered for incorrect answers. It might be a great study tool for Kids\\' Jeopardy, but useless for true learning.",
