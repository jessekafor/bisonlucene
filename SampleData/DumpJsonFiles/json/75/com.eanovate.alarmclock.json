    "description": "-Alarm Clock that alerts you with voice of your custom alert message for each alarm.-Number of alarms limited only by the amount of memory on your device.-Alarm can be set to repeat daily, on weekdays only, on particular weekday(s), on particular date with option to repeat yearly.-Option to repeat alarm on hourly/minute basis after the alarm first came due. For example, use this as a snooze feature.-Much more than just an alarm, this is your personal assistant: use it for birthday reminder, doctor's appointments, meetings, etc.-Notification when the alarm comes due, in addition to voice alert message. The notification can be disabled.-Record your action taken after your alarm came due. Records are kept for the past 7 days, and can be recalled anytime.-Check your Today's Agenda at anytime of the day for what's still remain to be done for today.-Announcement of the time/date of next alarm when the current alarm comes due. This announcement can be turned off if desired.We have tried to get more information from the user (Lenise) who claimed that this app contains a virus, but she's not responding. We don't know what her motive is for this claim, but it is extremely frustrating to us. A lot of time and efforts have been put into this app so that we think it may be useful for users of Android phones. For users who may be put off by her claim, we have now published the app in Amazon's appstore. Like Apple's iPhone appstore, Amazon test all the apps they publish in its appstore to verify the functionality. More important, it made sure the apps don't contain virus, before putting them in their appstore.2/27/2012 - release 1.0.0226: Added an enhancement.Please visit our website www.eanovate.com for more details about this app.",

        "comment": "This gets my attention when other things won\\'t. Eventually, I ignore the \\\"beeps\\\" or whatever because they come so often for so many different things, many of which do not require my immediate attention. This app tells me EXACTLY what I need to pay attention to and why....\\\"It\\'s *8am, time for your conference call\\\" Very useful. The only very minor \\\"complaint\\\" I have is that I liked the previous voice, a lower female voice better. I do wish we could adjust the voices to our liking somehow. If you would add a couple of voices, 5 stars. It seems with each device I get, the voice gets more \\\"computerized\\\". Please consider.",

You never hear the alarm at the time it is supposed to be going off, you just get a silent message that says, the alarm is not responding!  If your lucky, you will see the message when the alarm goes off, and you can remember what it was set for and what you were supposed to do at that time! Good luck! I contacted the developer and haven\\'t heard back!",

I like that appointments can be set for a future dates. What I\\'d like to see updated is the scroll mechanism. I reset reminders from week-to-week which means some dates are down in the list. When I reset the date, the list scrolls back to the beginning of the list instead of where I was. I usually need to reset several more reminders. Thanks for a great app!",
