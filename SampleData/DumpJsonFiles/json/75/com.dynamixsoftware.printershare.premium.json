        "comment": "A little complex in my case since my Canon Imageclass MF4890dw and my HP Officejet J4860 were not on the list of directly supported printers.  However, PrinterShare allows web passthru to my printers defined on my Windows 7 laptop using a special PrinterShare application installed on the PC.  Now that its set up, it works beautify to either of my printers.  Compared to how printers are integrated in all your applications on a PC, it takes a little getting used to to go into PrintShare first and then enter their sub-apps to actually print your email or your webpage etc.  None-the-less, it is wonderful to be able to finally print things from my ASUS Android tablet.",
