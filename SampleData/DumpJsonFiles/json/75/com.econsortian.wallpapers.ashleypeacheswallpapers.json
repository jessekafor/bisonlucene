    "description": "Ashley Peaches describes herself as a multi-talented hustler - there's nothing this 5'2\" Latina can't do!  She's a model, dancer, hair stylist, make-up artist, and fashion designer. She's famously appeared on two shirts for Rock the Bureau, one of which became a favorite of music celebrities for their videos and public appearances.  Peaches draws inspiration from the world around her, particularly film and photography.  Whether it's bringing her magnetic presence to music videos or working on her own bikini line, this Southern Californian renaissance woman lives life to the fullest. Be on the lookout for her, because who knows what she will conquer next.\"Women don't stay young forever. I am grateful for the opportunities I have now, and Iâm having fun.  At the end of my modeling career I want to look back with no regrets and say I tried and did everything I ever wanted to do.\"BOOKING::HOWIEWOOD Entertainment Howard \" Howie \" WoodPersonal Management for Celebrities, Reality TV Superstars, Bands, DJs and Published Models booking@howiewoodentertainment.com 702.807.0976In order to give you a free app and keep developing more free apps in the future, we are integrating a search tool to our application.
