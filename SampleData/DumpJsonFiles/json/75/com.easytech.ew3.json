    "description": "In European War 3 you will be a commander leading your soldiers to fight for resources, promote economic and industrial growth, develop new technology and seize opposing territory. Whenever deploying army, navy or air force, you need to take much thought due to their strength and weakness. Work on your defenses when you are in a weak position; build airport if you need air support. Fighting the battle could earn your forces experience and when they come to Ace Forces, their combat effectiveness would be impressive! Itâs also important to upgrade your commander level as you would take the lead. European War 3 also gives you a choice among different modes like Empire, Campaign, Conquest and Multiplayer. Empire Mode: conquest among 8 empires with 40 campaigns.[British Empire, German Empire, the United States, Japanese Empire, Qing Dynasty, French Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire] Campaign Mode: 30 actual historical campaigns (choose any force you like) Conquest Mode: choose any country to compete in Asia, Europe and America for hegemony. Multiplayer Mode: player versus player, available in 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 format. Features: - 28 command cards make the battle full of change. - 11 forces such as the army, navy and air force all have unique features. - 32 nations are involved across Europe, Asia and America, 1271 administrative regions in total. - Technology reaches up to five levels. - Mini-map display - The map can be zoomed in or zoomed out . - 15 levels of rank promotion (from Private to Field Marshal) - Auto-save",

        "comment": "it isnt difficult to find out what to do.  And it IS possible to win with the weaker country, for an example British Empire 5. battle(British Empire with a little of Siberia against Russia - east siberia; Japan - Manchuria; Qing Dinasty - China) you can win this battle easily in 13 rounds   The Resolution is low because the developer want that all devices can play this game. On iOS it has a HD version(can be bought together with the normal version) and the resolution of the handy version is higher. And I think this resolution is enough because u r playing a STRATEGY GAME and not games like NFS (sorry but my english isnt really good)  ps: the medals in EW3 can be used only in 1 battle, in WC2 they will be used the whole game",

        "comment": "This game has a lovely presentation, but is plagued by opaque rules which are not explained in the tutorial, and a non-interactive tutorial which simply gives one a vague overview of the game. Once it\\'s time to play, one has to figure out most of it himself, which makes strategizing extremely difficult to do. Additionally, the text is sometimes confusing (it was obviously not written by a native english speaker), giving a slightly less-than-professional feel to an otherwise beautiful interface. After playing for about an hour, i still have little idea how the combat system actually works (sure, i can partake in combat, but don\\'t have any feel whatsoever for what the outcome of a battle will be, so i\\'m not a terribly effective commander!). i\\'m quite certain that this game is much more fun once one figures out how exactly the mechanics work, but i\\'m not willing to invest so much time in figuring all that out for myself - the tutorial should have _walked_ me through that info rather than just providing me with a few non-interactive/read-along screens which don\\'t explain the basic things like how to deploy troops.",

I have to wait about 4-5 mins for it to return to my android home menu when this happens. Has happened 5 times already. Secondly, the gold medals go missing in next mission. This usually happens when I restart the level and find that the gold spent on improvement is gone AND no improvements recorded. Once these are fixed it would be an incredible game - even though it is one of the priciest on Google play. I was tempted to purchase medals but then this problem started. Not very confident now!

The game has been what I have expected Android developers to do for ages. Really addictive, have spent lot of time on it. Great job!  What I would add to the game is:  1. Diplomacy, when I attack my allies they should turn against me  2. Small historical Wiki that would additionally make the experience of the history lovers even greater  3. The addition of some functionality for multiple units (let us say \\\"art of defense\\\") is too much tapping, make the interface better.   4. Add numerical value to the health  5. Make some research time dependable not only money dependable (money can speed up the research)  6. Experience points from campaigns do not add up to the total experience  7. Make some of the units country specific  8. Touch sometimes is not working correctly (zooming when I want to move)  9. Add mode when user does not have good mode (see everything, know everything)   Can\\'t wait to see a game in the period from Peter the 1st to Napoleon era, the Colonization and the Boston tea party.",
