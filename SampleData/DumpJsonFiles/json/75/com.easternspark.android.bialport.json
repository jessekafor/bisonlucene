    "description": "If you are going to or from the Bangalore (Bengaluru) International Airport, this application will most likely serve all your transit needs. Contains information on state run transport bus (BIAS) schedules, fares, maps and more.You can also access inbound, outbound flight schedule of the day with live status of individual flights such as 'Boarding', 'Landed', 'Security', 'Final Call', 'Canceled' etc..Provides neatly organized list of contacts of airport authorities, facilities, airlines, taxi operations along with links to their phone numbers, websites and emails. Should you need, you may also launch your phones dialer, browser, or email application (by confirming when prompted) to communicate with the selected contact.This application requests the following permissions:INTERNET:  To show route maps and check for flight status.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION:  To show your relative position on the route map.CALL_PHONE:  To be able to request phone dialer to call the airlines or airport authorities from within the application. You will ALWAYS be prompted for confirmation before initiating call.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:  To detect if network is available and issue message if not.The information on transport routes for this application was taken from a static source and eventually may go out of date. I will however endeavor to keep it current and updated.The application strives to be intuitive, easy and quick to use. Requests for new features or suggestions for improvement are welcome and appreciated. I hope you find it as useful as I do :-)",
