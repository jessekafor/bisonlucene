        "comment": "I had a hard time believing all the negative reviews, but I\\'m a believer now. Advertising partially obscures the username and password fields on the login screen, making data entry very difficult. And the login button had absolutely NO effect, the login screen just sat there doing nothing. I gave it one star because it looks nice. Bleah.",

        "comment": "I have to say this is the worst app I\\'ve ever used on Android.  We attempted the App on two different Androids with the same disappointing results.  The app is unresponsive and drains battery life.  If it is developed and fixed properly it would have massive potential.  Unfortunately, the app was released in a non-responsive state and continues to get bad reviews.  If and when it is fixed it will be too late due to the reviews being so horrible.  It should just be removed until fixed so that it can have a better outlook for the future.",
