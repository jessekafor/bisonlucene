A dog whistle works by emitting a high frequency tone in a range that a dog does not ordinarily encounter. The highest frequency a normal middle aged human can hear is 12,000-14,000 Hz, so donât be alarmed if you canât hear all of the tones yourself. These high frequency tones have the effect of immediately getting a dogâs attention. Dog whistles are typically used as part of a training routine designed to train your dog to do tricks or for behavior modification. A pure tone is much easier for a dog to distinguish compared to verbal commands. Different sound patterns can be used to trigger different responses. For example, two short bursts could mean stop and one long burst could mean lie down. Dog whistles are great training tools and has been used successfully with all breeds.Search Keyword: dog whistle, dog training, stop dog barking, anti bark, dog training app, dog whistle app, how to train a dog with a whistle",
