    "description": "Plain, simple and easy to use.'Challenge' tab with unlimited automatically generated Sudokus and a global leader board (powered by ScoreNinja).About Sudoku - Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. Starting with a partially completed 9x9 grid, the objective is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each of the 3x3 boxes (also called blocks) contains the digits 1 to 9 exactly once.This is my first Android application. I learnt Android from the book \"Hello, Android\" by Ed Brunette. The book played a major role in helping me complete this app and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to develop for Android.Also, feel free to report any bugs/errors and changes you feel will make the app better.Latest Version - 2.2",
