I can\\'t complain that the interface looks old compared to other apps, because it looks nice in its own way, and because of the Wolf Helm.

My only real wishes would be to integrate graphs and task tracking (being able to see what tasks you\\'ve done in the past in graphic form), online storage of your data so it can be transfered between phones (not sure if i\\'ll have to start all over when i get my new phone, but i think that will be the case) and some social functions (a forum, high scores, chat, etc). Otherwise an excellent app that does exactly what it\\'s designed to do.",
