        "comment": "With my poor health, 10 specialists, 20 medications, insulin shots, family history, this app is great. In categories where I wasn\\'t able to list my results for my INR or blood sugars, I created my own categories.  I even created a special area for my dog and his dr, and immunizations.  Very thankful for this valuable piece of software.  Would be great to be able to upload info to my computer to cross-reference and back up.",
