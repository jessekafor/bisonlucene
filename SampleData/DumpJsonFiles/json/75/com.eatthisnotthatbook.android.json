        "comment": "I got this ap based in large part on how much I enjoyed their books. Unfortunately, it seems that that book sitting on my bookshelf gets updated about as much as this ap. Menus are constantly changing, and I expect this ap to keep up a little. There are also typos in a lot of the entries for restaurant items. A single item will be listed more than once with different calories and a different grade. That being said, still a good ap that will absolutely help you make healthier choices at fast food joints.",

        "comment": "I\\'m a huge fan of the \\\"Eat This, Not That!\\\" books and website, so when I saw an easy way to take ETNT with me, I jumped on it.  You\\'ll get a top swaps menu for most of the popular chain restaurants in America, featuring two or three swaps you can make, and a letter rating for most (but not all) of the foods and drinks served at these places.  I love the letter rating system, but it\\'s deficient in some places.  (Why aren\\'t the drinks at Starbucks rated?  That\\'s their main draw.)  What you won\\'t get are the awesome lists that can be found on the website.  What if I wanted to take my 50 Best Snack Foods list with me?  Too bad.  It also has an option to track calories, but I don\\'t use it because it\\'s clumsy.  I wish I could go from looking the food up on the grade menu straight to adding it to my calorie counter, but I have to go back to the menu screen, load up the calorie counter, then look up my food and add it.  Would definitely like to see some more restaurants.  Caribou Coffee has over 400 locations, Atlanta Bread Company has 110; take a guess who gets the nutritional analysis.",
