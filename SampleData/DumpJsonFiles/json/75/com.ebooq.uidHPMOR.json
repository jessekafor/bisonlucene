    "description": "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR), the most popular Harry Potter fan fiction on the Net!Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter...Disclaimer: J. K. Rowling owns Harry Potter, and no one owns the methods of rationality.--------------------This fic is widely considered to have really hit its stride starting at around Chapter 5. If you still don't like it after Chapter 10, give up.This is not a strict single-point-of-departure fic - there exists a primary point of departure, at some point in the past, but also other alterations. The best term I've heard for this fic is \"parallel universe\".The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of a TV show running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose episodes are individually plotted but with an overall arc building to a final conclusion.All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.-----------------HPMOR is an app that you can use to read HPMOR with your Android phone or tablet (v 2.2 and newer). It works online and offline, and automatically updates when the author adds or edits chapters. You can change fonts, font sizes and adjust the page to make it easy on your eyes.",

        "comment": "It\\'s pretty nice to have this dedicated app to auto update as new chapters are published out revisions made. I would prefer some tweaks to the UI, though.  There\\'s no need for the menu buttons to be on screen at all times, and I probably wouldn\\'t mind if the progress bar and chapter title would hide as well. Sometimes the page count gets pushed off screen by long chapter titles.  Look to Aldiko for a great unobtrusive UI for general purpose ebooks.",
