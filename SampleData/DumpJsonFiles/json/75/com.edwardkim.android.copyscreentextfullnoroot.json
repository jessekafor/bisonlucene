Iphone is much better, you can copy and paste in any app and its built in iphone, dont have to download an app to accomplish it. For me and the way I need to copy and paste its no good, and you cant get a refund.",

I have been using this for 3 days now on my Note 2 and find it real good & easy to use. While some people may find taking the sceenshot and then making the text selection cumbersome,  it seems the best way out as of now. A suggestion to the Developer- it would be good if other apps like Whats App, etc are integrated so that the copied text can be directly sent from the desired app. Thanks.",

In fact, most of the issues people seem to have with apps in general are a result of having a cheap droid.  Also, most users don\\'t understand that due to limitations of the hardware or the version of Android you\\'re running have their limits.  I am by no means a developer.  However, I have been building, fixing and working with things like networks and other computer hardware for years.  So I (as a user) understand why things don\\'t always work to the expectations of your average user.  You guys need to get over yourselves.  This developer has made a very decent piece of software.  It would be great if somehow a scroll feature could be added to the copy area so that if you have a great deal of text (I\\'m visually impaired so I use it for speech). But folks, bottom line. This is an excellent app for what it does.  So try reading the directions for once. There\\'s no need to trash the developer because YOU won\\'t take the time to follow instructions.",
