If I have 6 hotels on the board with no one else having monopolies on the board, and I send the first player to bankruptcy, that deserves a win. Rather than the computer who owns 3 properties with 700k in their hand. Other Monopoly games calculate the Net Worth as the ranking of players and so does every version of Monopoly rules. Please follow suit.",
