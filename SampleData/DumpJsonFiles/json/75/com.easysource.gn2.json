        "comment": "Lucidmike is the Ultra Top Teacher on the planet for SGN2, his videos are better than Samsung, Android, or any of the wireless serv providers I\\'ve been able to find in 4 months of searching.  Sadly Samsung engineers dropped the ball on the premium features of their brilliantly engineered product!  SGN2 is Over the top in abilities, but info on learning to use it- and the esoteric features seems seriously impoverished till My Hero Lucidmike was discovered! Thank you Mike!!! I felt \\\"exploited\\\" till now!",
