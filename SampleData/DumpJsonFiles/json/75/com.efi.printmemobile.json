It is an easy-to-use, fast app with no ads. Use it to print from your workspace or conference room, or as you move from one floor to another, visit buildings across your corporate campus or travel to a company office in another city.PrintMe Mobile publishes a list of company printers that automatically appear on your Android smartphone or tablet. PrintMe Mobile does not require a wireless printer â and works with all brands and types of printers on your company network.Print by selecting âShareâ, âOpen Withâ, âComplete Action Usingâ, or similar commands â depending on the application. You just use your normal application menus, choose the PrintMe Mobile app to select a printer, choose your printing options, and print.PrintMe Mobile preserves fonts and layouts so your document prints the way it should on any printer. So you get high-quality prints wherever you are, whenever you need them.See a video showing how easy it is to use at www.efi.com/printmemobile.Then ask your IT department to download and install the 45-day free trial of the full feature PrintMe Mobile software for enterprise mobile printing at www.efi.com/printmemobile.

        "comment": "As other reviewers have said,  those giving this 1 star are not understanding the app. And the incoherence of some of the statements is weird and scary. Are you ok?   This app, once installed properly on a PC, works really well. Not sure yet what it will cost after 45 days, but it is the only app that so far has printed out PDFs the way they look on the screen (and the way Acrobat shows them in Windows). Web pages come out nicely, too.  However, I can\\'t get it to print any DOC files. So for that I will use the $7 DirectOffice app,  which prints them the way they look using a Windows version of Word.    That\\'s the Android world for you.  But shelling out $7 for an app that works for most of your needs is still better that $30 for a Windows app that \\\"scans your registry for errors\\\", if you know what I mean. You paid anywhere from $200-$800 for your Android device,  so you can\\'t be that poor.   Anyway, EFI and DO at least avoid that idiotic Google Cloud crap that prints everything out as if it went through a down-sampler to 150 dpi,  like some fax. I mean, if Google were to get rid of that noise and really make GC do what everyone expects it to, we would all be just so happy.",
