    "description": "The CodeRED Mobile Alert app keeps users informed and ahead of the storm. Designed to keep you informed and aware, the CodeRED Mobile Alert app taps into the national CodeREDÂ® Emergency Notification System and alerts subscribers located within the reach of a given notification generated by public safety officials. The app is geo-aware so no matter where you are when an alert is issued, you will receive notifications that affect you - right on your mobile device. The app transmits geographically-based notifications; requiring subscribers to enable their location services so the app can determine the userâs specific location. The CodeRED Mobile Alert app delivers information from community officials in areas that are subscribed to the CodeRED Emergency Notification System. Additionally, national organizations used by public safety officials and police departments may utilize the system to send messages to targeted geographic areas. Future uses could include augmenting Federal Government issued critical alerts, such as those transmitted through IPAWS as an additional Alert Disseminator in support of the FEMA program. The app comes with a complimentary 30-day trial of CodeRED Weather Warningâ¢, a program that sends subscribers notifications when they are in the projected path of severe weather. Notifications are received from The National Weather Service and immediately communicated with CodeRED Mobile Alert subscribers without any delay. The CodeRED Weather Warning add-on is an additional $4.99 per year. If your city or state does not currently subscribe to the CodeRED Emergency Notification System, contact your elected officials today to let them know that your community would benefit from this service.PLEASE NOTE: Subscribers are encouraged to turn OFF GPS location services and turn ON wireless network location services to reduce battery drain.Questions or issues regarding the app?
