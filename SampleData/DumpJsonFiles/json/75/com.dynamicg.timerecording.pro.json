    "description": "This is the \"Pro\" version of Time Recording, market leader in timesheet apps in the Google Play store.â PLEASE USE THE FREE VERSION FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE GOING PRO! Refund time is too short to test all the features, the free version has all the core functionality.â¢ Free and Pro versions are basically identical, so free version users will feel at home.â¢ Main \"Pro only\" feature is Â«Google calendar syncÂ», plus it's ad-free.â¢ Migration to Pro is easy: install and open \"Pro\" - the app will prompt for import of data and settings from the free version.â¢ Usage of Free and Pro version in parallel is supported but may lead to confusion. Consider uninstalling the free version a few days after \"Pro\" migration.â For detailed changelog see FAQ.â App also available on www.androidpit.com for those who want to pay through PayPal.",
