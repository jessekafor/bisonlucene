The slideshow being on my tablet is a superb enhancement HOWEVER I specifically use this RP App on my bedside tablet so that I can listen to the superb Radio Paradise as I fall to sleep.  The old App had a timer function to auto switch off.  This has been removed / is missing from slideshow version.  ALSO - the old version allowed tablet screen to turn off = total darkness when listening at night  -  this is no longer an option.   PLEASE RECTIFY.  UPDATE 15/4/13 -   Cratorsoft you are the best.   The timer option reinstated already.   Thanks",

Absolutely great job - and thank you!  Rock on Bill; rock on RP...",
