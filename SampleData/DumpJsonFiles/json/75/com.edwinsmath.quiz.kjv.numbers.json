    "description": "Author â MosesTime â 1,500 â 1,460 B.C.Summary â Numbers s a historical book, whose name refers to the two censuses which were taken to number the people. However, it was known to the Jewish people as \"In the Wilderness\", because it primarily tells of the rebellion of the Israelites in the desert where they wandered after the Exodus from their slavery in Egypt. Because of this rebellion, only 2 men of the adults leaving Egypt were to enter into the land of Canaan promised to Abraham in Genesis. The rest died in the desert. The book covers a 38 year period",
