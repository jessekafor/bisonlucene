    "description": "Mobile Energy Monitoring! View energy data sent from your efergy engage hub on your phone. Weâve included the same great widgets for you to check and reduce your use. Discover if youâve left something on, set a budget and get saving. No engage hub yet? No worries, try our built-in demo.This is the best way to track your home energy consumption on the go. Once you have installed the engage app you will have access to a range of features that allow you to monitor your energy consumption remotely.Notice:This app works only with the efergy engage hub. You must first register an account, set-up your hub and pair it with your transmitter at engage.efergy.com before you can see your energy usage on the smartphone app.Features:Your energy use:Takes into account your current real time usage level and whether you are under or over budget to rate your behaviour.Widget library:Collection of engage widgets, access each widget by selecting a tile on-screen.Real-time:Display real-time power use in kW, cost and kgCo2. Set an energy consumption alarm. There are four different widget styles to choose from.Budget:Show how much you have spent and what your estimated monthly spend will be. Set the budget target through the menu option.Cost so far:Shows you how much you have spent today, this month and since a user set date (through the menu option).Energy graph:The energy graph widget allows you to see your demand in kW along with your consumption over daily and monthly periods. Rotate your phone to change the level of detail shown on each graph. Landscape shows you the overall trend and portrait shows you a closer look at your data. Use the arrows to go backward and forward in time to view your consumption history.Social media:Use this to post your performance data to a social media site of your choice (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn is available).Display:The display style will change to night mode at 9pm everyday, altering the appearance of the app. Options are available within Settings to disable this feature and choose a particular style.
