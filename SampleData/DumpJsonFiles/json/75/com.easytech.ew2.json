        "comment": "- this now runs without borders on tablets, and the touch control is spot on. The game itself is a Risk variant  but let down by lack of finish. The graphics are too blurry for tablets: a shame, because the look and feel of this game is a strong selling point. There\\'s also a link to an in-app purchase which doesn\\'t work. 5 stars when fixed.",

On occasion you might have to \\\"remove\\\" an ally from a territory. With some interface improvements I\\'d give the game 5 stars.",
