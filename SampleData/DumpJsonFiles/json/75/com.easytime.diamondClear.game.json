    "description": "Noah and his animals had been turned adrift on the sea for a very very long time. After the flood finally came the land.The ark landed succesfully. Now it's time for Noah and his family to return the animals to the wild. But why are these animals looking so unanimated?\"For the long ride, a bit dizzy,maybe.\"\"Aren't they be landed to be in pairs?\"\"Ah, it was too hurried to do that.\"\"Must be in pairs?\"\"Of course.\"\"All right, let me get them off the ark.MoveTouch and drag the square to move it. The square  can move towards left or right freely.FallThe square falls when moving out of the supporting floor until  it lands on the supporting floor again.ClearWhen Two or three squares of the same kind meet together,would disappear. PassWhen all the squares in one level are cleared, the player accomplishes task at this level.",

        "comment": "no access to 2nd epsd not responsive to touch engh Super touch insensitive; crashes often; once the last level of the first episode is complete and \\\"all cleared\\\" message shows up, I press the menu icon and the app consistently crashes and doesn\\'t proceed onto the next one, so can\\'t unlock the second episode. (moto droid) Also, levels are not chronologically more difficult -- difficult ones are kind of random. And last but not least -- the screen at the end of the level is a complete Angry Birds rip off.",
