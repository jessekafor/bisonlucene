Workout daily to keep your mind stimulated.Your child plays to learn.Your parent keeps brain age young.And for you, it depends.Playing the game is easy (finding equation that works), but mastering it is hard due to the cleverly crafted scoring system. Make strategical decisions and improve skills to plan ahead.Each equation found adds to your score with a base score that's multiplied by a bonus:1. Use the silver and gold pieces to increase base score2. Use the center colored number (previous answer) to increase bonus multiplierWatch gameplay video example below or in game instructions to see how to achieve a massive high score.Features:- 4 different game modes- no log-in needed for global high scores- optional local scores only available- fun bouncy music- edutainment for all agesGame Modes:Kids - designed for toddler, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders. 5th graders can play other modes.Timeless - no timer, play until stuck.Quick - one minute time limit makes you think like a maniac.Survival - frantically find an equation within 15 seconds.PRACTICE ON FUNDAMENTALSAlthough not algebra or calculus, it is important to work on the basics. Do arithmetic and formulas with math operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.ELEMENTARY MATH HELP FOR KIDSKindergarten, first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grade math development. Avoid traditional boring teacher apps, math books, flash cards, formulary graph, facts mania, converter tricks, reflection conversions, math drills, or memorizing the multiplication tables.TODDLERS CAN PLAY TOOEven if your boys or girls cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide yet, they can still get familiar with numbers and symbols. Start preschool learning to help conquer their future fear in math. Like infant games, babies can enjoy good background music, and nice sound effects when they press the monkees.MANY EXTRA LITTLE DETAILSA lot of thought were put into things like how the colors cycle through the 7 rainbow colors in order, and common numbers used between 2 through 81. Tutor your child into a genius.Formally named Mathgame, Einstein Math Academy runs well on almost all phones and tablets thanks to AndEngine.Please send any feedback or questions through e-mail or follow and tweet to @BrainGamingNote: All permissions are needed and used by Scoreloop and Admob.This free lite version is supported by non-obtrusive ads in the menus only. I'm sorry if you don't like ads, but if you're rich then buy the deluxe paid version without ads called Einstein Math Academy Gold.Albert Einstein quotes: \"Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.\" That's why we love to massage random equations into calculators to get them solved.BRAIN TEASERS AS A MEMORY BOOSTERQuick mental math calculations slow down mental aging, Dementia, Alzheimers, and other mental disorders. Brain workouts for women or men have training peaks too. Overcome them with regular brain exercises every day. User leaderboard as a tracker for your brain fitness progress. This math equation solver game is a brain pop scanner. Use your sight and vision as a flashlight through the scramble mess. Use the game as a ref buddy trainer, to attack and surge your brain reactor with food and statistics to keep it sooth and fit.BORED TO DEATHDon't battle boredom with non-educational games like Bejeweled Blitz, Bubble Buster, Power Blasters Sync, Bingo Mouse 13, Su Doku, Dead Space Storm, Tiny Wings, Tap Revenge, Fruit Ninja, Slice It, Scrabble Cheats, Wordfeud, or Dictionary Words. We need more cool math games for dummies or nerds alike. Old elderly master Dr. Albert Einstein reminds his students to floss their teeth, eat fruit, and set your alarm clock to play daily. He likes tutoring and testing with quiz in class to figure out who's a homework copying cheater.",
