        "comment": "Very good idea and a very useful app, just 3 things would make this a 5 star app. 1: Shake should adjust the brightness not bring up a menu. 2: Also should be an option to start app when phone starts. 3: Also you should be able to adjust the shake sensitivity. I will give 1 star for each fix. Fix all and get 5 stars. Thanks",
