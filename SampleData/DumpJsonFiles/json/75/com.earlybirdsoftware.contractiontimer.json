        "comment": "This was perfect for helping us track contractions while I was in labor.  The large start/stop button meant that even my mom could use the app accurately.  We especially found the calculations of the durations for the past 20 minutes and past hour to be very helpful as it gave us an easy way to determine how things were progressing.  It was also great to be able to skim back through the history of all the contractions.  It was so much easier to give good information to the midwives to help them know when to arrive.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  We have a healthy, lovely baby girl, born at home at 9 lb, 5 oz, and monitoring labor was definitely easier with this app.",
