Unlimited coins makes you pass the level so delightful! Wide screen and felt feedback make you hell of good time!Play Arcade Games -- on your road, on your bed, even on your bath! Just Have Fun!Join us now and bring back your treasurable childhood, enjoy gaming!The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to some 1980s arcade fighting games like Taito's Violence Fight, SNK's Street Smart and Atari's Pit-Fighter. Because of this, unlike many other 2D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, and does not use the \"D\" button, unlike many SNK fighting games. Only two action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick); instead, grappling and grabbing opponents is the focus of the gameplay: opponents can counter being grabbed and break free as well. Also featured is weapon play. Weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special and standard attacks. Weapons are thrown into the ring by spectators in the background. Another innovation of the game is that characters begin to sweat profusely after fighting for a while.",
