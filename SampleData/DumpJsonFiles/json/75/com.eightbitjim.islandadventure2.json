    "description": "80's-style platform game! Guide Eight Bit Bit Jim through six episodes of retro mayhem!Eight Bit Jim is on an adventure. His Pixel Jump-jet has run out of fuel and he needs to find some on a desert island. But it's not that simple. He must run around on PLATFORMS, jump over BADDIES and collect COINS, which is how his days usually turn out.It's almost like the last 30 years didn't happen. This game doesn't benefit from recent advances in graphics, sound effects and AI. As far as Eight Bit Jim is concerned, it's still 1983. Play all six episodes:Episode 1: Hello 8-bit JimEpisode 2: Caverns of fearEpisode 3: Trouble in the cellarEpisode 4: The History of Halfprincess Ooo.Episode 5: Village in the cloudsEpisode 6: Showdown at the centre of the Earth.Bonus episode: Lawnmower JimLook out for rooms that pay homage to the Commodore 64, Atari 2600, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum!If you have already played the first two episodes in the free version of the game, you can start at episode 3.",
