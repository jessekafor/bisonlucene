Also having problems getting the second turntable to play a selected track and the crossfade doesn\\'t seem to be working. Love the app, however - really nice user interface and fun to play with.  Still having problems with the app crashing on the HTC One X+ after the latest update - similar problems as above...8/16 - still crashing. Hopefully, this will be fixed, shortly.",
