I am also a liquor model, market manager, & event manager for several brands and agencies, including:JamesonMalibu Ultimat VodkaAbsolutCoors LightBlue MoonLucid AbsinthePatronUV VodkaFeckin Irish WhiskeyLe Tourment Vert AbsintheHornitos TequilaNewcastle BeerFrangelicoThree Olives Vodkaand a ton of others...When I am not working, I try to spend as much time with my poochie & my peeps, as possible....yes, I still LOVE to shop!!! :) Love the beach and try to stay away from the cold Winters of Chicago as much as possible. Love my pooch Max, and he is spoiled to death!! I am also an aunt and have the CUTEST nephews in the world!! :DSo, that is me in a nutshell, I suppose....I work a lot, live a pretty crazy, all over the place life, but I would not trade it for anything and have no complaints....live today like you have no tomorrow, and live your dreams, rather than dream them! :)In order to give you a free app and keep developing more free apps in the future, we are integrating a search tool to our application.
