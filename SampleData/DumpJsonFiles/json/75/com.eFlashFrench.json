        "comment": "I m french and wanted my kids to start learning it. It s good but quite a few mistakes so I don\\'t dare get the paying version (to avoid adverts that my kids keep making pop up in case the mistakes are there as well. Ex the shape diamond. Is translated as the gem diamant but should be losange. As well some words like log are in Spanish... Otherwise pronunciation is clear and you can either swipe or press next so my 2 year old can change card easily.",
