Very easy to set up, it keeps track of all medications, you can set up multiple profiles, so you can track more than one person\\'s medications, etc. I showed the app to my nurse and she thought it was great too, made a note of it and was going to download it for herself!  Two items I would like the developers to address: 1) Have an option to make the alarms louder, and more than just one simple beep. 2) In the Inventory Tracking, there seems to be a bug. If you need to adjust the quantities, when you go into edit mode, sometimes the counts are WAY OFF (ie. edit inventory shows inventory quantity as \\\"56\\\" but display quantity shows \\\"4\\\". If you try to enter what you actually have, say, 6, when you save, it shows quantity of \\\"-50\\\". The only way to correct this is to delete the medication and start over.",

Prescriptions: Allows you to enter a great amount of detail about a prescription, invaluable for reference and for scheduling. 3. Take as Needed: Very useful for tracking medication not taken regularly. 4. Manage Profile: Very useful for families. Tracks multiple people. 5. Reporting: Useful for sending medication history to Dr. or others. 6. Doctors / Pharmacies: Usually entered in the Prescription field but nice to see an overview.  Part 2, not so useful features (at least for me): 1. Med Log: duplicates the Schedule function because Schedule already shows past events. 2. Vitals: I keep this with my medical records because it is not taken too often. This app doesn\\'t seem to USE this information in any practical way. If tracking this all the time recommend device such as Fitbit. 3. Notes: Already places to put notes in most other categories, but I could see some people using this. 4. Appointments: I use a calendar for this and this app does not allow calendar syncing. Don\\'t find this function useful even if it did sync.",

        "comment": "Great app. The only thing I would like added is a way to import medicines. A data reference that already has all info on most meds. I don\\'t know what meds interact and this could help flag some things before I swallow. It would also be nice to not have multiple active entries when both my doctor and dentist prescribe me ibuprofen. This could be avoided with a centralized med database, and then just referencing who prescribed them.",
