This app provides access to original water news stories and videos about Water Authority projects and initiatives, as well as news releases, legislative information, board documents, and water-related news stories gathered from around the web.The Water Authority is a regional wholesale supplier of imported water to the San Diego region. It was created in 1944 by the California State Legislature to supply a safe and reliable water supply to its 24 member agencies serving the San Diego region. The member agencies, in turn, provide that water to homes, businesses, agriculture, and the military in San Diego County. The Water Authority purchases water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, who receives its water from the Colorado River and Northern Californiaâs Bay-Delta.",
