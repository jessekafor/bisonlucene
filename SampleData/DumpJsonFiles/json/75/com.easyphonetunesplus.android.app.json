All the tracks from my iTunes playlists seems to have been copied and the exported playlists (.m3u) look ok (this is a key feature for me).  Now, for an unknown reason, the stock music player is unable to read properly the playlists: only a subset  of the tracks are shown. So I will need to try with another music app.   Beside that, I\\'ve just encountered a small glitch during my first sync: one track was rejected for some unknown reasons. It has worked properly the second time.",

Some podcasts will play thru with no trouble, others will play only the opening and closing titles, or just advance in mid-sentence at some seemingly random point.  If the first problem happens, I cannot scroll anywhere in the podcast and make it play, but if the second one happens, I can *usually go back to that episode, scroll to just past the point that it advanced, and play on.  At least till the next time it happens.  Podcasts that won\\'t play at all include all Radiolab; and some episodes Point of Inquiry, Engines of our Ingenuity, and 99% Invisible.  Podcasts that do the random thing include On Being, Hardcore History, and Snap Judgement.  My phone player is NOT on shuffle or repeat, and my iPod plays every one of these episodes flawlessly.",
