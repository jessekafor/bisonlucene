        "comment": "This game is sick!! I already finished campaign glory and crusader mode. Hope more updates are coming. Sometimes my scrolling gets locked needs an update on that. Also you guys need to add a feature where you can select multiple units at once, I like to build an army and just attack the waves head on just for kicks. other then that no other problems.. Gold is hard to come by. But with a good defense and offense it\\'ll be easily rewarded.",

Beating a stage sure gives gold but no where enough to continue. I am stuck in one wave in story, with no gold and keep failing for just to get 100 gold. Either more gold in this game or enable to replay past stages to get gold and upgrade your units. Don\\'t waste your dollar in this frustrating game.",

But there is one problem that sometimes, the control of screen is randomly moving around when you accidently move around the screen with two fingers. Its really hard to fix it once the control is lost. And some people say it is hard to get golds but actually it is easy to get golds because once you fail you can restart with golds you just earned from your lost battle. So c\\'mon! ! Give it a try!",

Fix this and I will give 5 stars.\\tThe game itself is really fun, and does require a bit of tatical sense when it comes to building your castle, placing your troops. The reviewer that says this game does not give you enough gold is an idiot. I am already on round 8 which each round has 5 stages within those, and I have had very minimal to no trouble gold shortages to complete the level. Sometimes the default setup of your castle and troops is not always the best remeber that. Biggest flaw in game is the camera messing up though. Please fix.",
