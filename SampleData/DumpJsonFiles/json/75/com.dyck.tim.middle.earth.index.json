    "description": "Even as a Tolkien fanatic, it is often tough to remember all the names and places when reading his extensive works.  Here is your glossary of all things Tolkien, with over 5000 entries!  The perfect companion to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, or The Silmarillion.This application is also a useful aide when watching the movies!  In 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey', there are many references to things that die-hard Tolkien fans will understand, yet the casual movie-goer will not.  The dwarves mention Ered Luin, Dain, and Durin.  Radagast calls the spiders a \"spawn of Ungoliant\".  Gandalf warns Radagast of the \"Gundabad wargs\", yet Radagast is unafraid with his \"Rhosgobel rabbits\".  Galadriel speaks of the Witch-King of Angmar, and Rhudaur.  These references, among others, can now easily be looked-up and understood.     Features include an intuitive categorization, search capabilities, and links for more information.This is my first app, built purely for my own enjoyment.  Even after multiple readings of The Silmarillion or Unfinished Tales, I still found it hard to remember the massive amount of information, and didn't like going online to find it, so I started designing this app.  Now I have decided to share it with everyone! Please rate, and feel free to send me constructive criticism.  I am planning to continue updating the appearance, layout, entry information, version support, and will hopefully add a search widget.",

        "comment": "This is a great app and very fun to go through. It is set up well though I would suggest that there be embedded links on the pages. This would be especially helpful for things that have multiple names so if you only know the English translation you don\\'t then have to remember and search for the elvish or dwarvish name.",
