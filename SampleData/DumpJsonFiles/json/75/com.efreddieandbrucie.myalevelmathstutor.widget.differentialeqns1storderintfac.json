    "description": "Hi Guys,Enter a differential equation (integrating factor form or Bernouilli form and this works out the solution, showing you it all step by step. It basically does just what it says on the tin. So if you have homework that you need to check out, then look no further.The widget tool is taken from the selection of tools that appears on my live worksheet app entitled Differential Equations I, that appears on my developer page.Hope it proves helpful.Cheers,Mark",
