This can be quite annoying. 2) after reading the info about a show and then pressing back it returns to the schedule for the current time. I then have to flick through all the pages to get back to the time slot I was interested in! VERY ANNOYING!!! You really need to fix this ASAP.",

I dont watch a lot of TV but of those times I do, it never goes wrong. One dissatisfaction I have is about reminders. I love to set-up reminders but unfortunately this one carries a lengthy title, with the full name \\\"ebroadcast notification\\\", and then the date and time, and name of program.  This has taken one full line and with my Nexus 4, this is about the only thing  I see in my calendar.  I wish they just shorted it to 2 characters, then channel number, and title of the TV show. Maybe one day.....",
