    "description": "The \"Using democratic dialogue to reinvent democracy\" Structured Democratic Dialogue Process (SDDP) has been organized by Future Worlds Center in order to engage youth in envisioning and designing their own ideal socio-political-economic environments. The 5-day long event took place at the Venus Beach Hotel in Pafos, Cyprus between the 28th of June and the 3rd of July 2012.Two SDDPs focused on developing a vision and identifying obstacles preventing societies from reaching their ideal vision. The root problems identified were: the repletion of the paleolithic system and the non-development of the political system.This App does not include the tree of influences or the actual final results. It includes however all the original contributions of the participants as short video clips.The workshop was funded under the Action 1.3 - Youth Democracy Projects of the Youth in Action Programme of the European Commission and was under the auspices of the Cyprus Presidency and the Institute for 21st Century Agoras.The event was organized by Future Worlds Center in collaboration with ANTIGONE (Greece), University of Peloponnese (Greece) and Youth for Exchange and Understanding (Cyprus).More information about this and several similar projects can be found at the Future Worlds Pedia:http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/SDDP_Reinvent_Democracy_-_ObstaclesOther useful Links:â¢ www.FutureWorlds.euâ¢ www.GlobalAgoras.orgâ¢ http://re-invent-democracy.wikispaces.comThe App was developed by Ekkotek, for Future Worlds Center.Design and Analysis: Yiannis LaourisProgramming: Katerina FotiouVideo Editing: Maria GeorgiouCopyrights 2013 Ekkotek.",
