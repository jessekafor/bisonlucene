The international nature of the program means that the content is adaptable to a variety of geographic, economic, social, and medical practice situations.Whether in a hospital trauma bay, on the highway at a motor vehicle crash, in a disaster area after a bombing, or in a foreign countryâs war zone, clinicians need ready access to critical resources and references. The content and skills presented in this app will add to the armamentarium of doctors and other clinicians who treat trauma patients. The app includes a free preview of the 1st chapter.Additional content can be purchased to instantly gain full access to the following:â¢Interactive visuals, such as treatment algorithms and x-ray identification â¢Just in Time video segments capturing key skills in minutes â¢Calculators, such as pediatric burn calculator and the Parkland Formula to determine fluid administrationâ¢Animations, such as airway management and surgical cricothyroidotomyFor those who have purchased the 9th edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual, simply enter the book code that was packaged in the book to gain free access to all the content.",
