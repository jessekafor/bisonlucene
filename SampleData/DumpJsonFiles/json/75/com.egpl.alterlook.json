    "description": "AlterLook turns you into that style guru that will bring everyone to their knees when the fate of every photo lies in your hand. With thousands of styles you can create from over 30 outrageous hairstyles and shades, you have the power to create a whole new frontier for the fashion world in an instance that even the most avant-garde would not even dare dream of. And here's how you do it:1. Grab any photo that you have on your Android phone that you want to exercise your creativity on. Be sure you have someone's face in it. A scenic view of the Fuji mountain wouldn't cut it.2. Mix and match any hairstyle and any shades to your heart's content and they will be instantly and automatically mapped to the person's face.3. Someoneâs face is out of proportion and you need fine adjustment? Just zoom into the photo to put on that final touch-up.4. Made a mistake? Not a problem. Just shake it and everything will come off. The dress stays by the way.5. A masterpiece of the century you can't wait to share with others? Post them on Facebook. That's good karma.",

        "comment": "I tried and tried to make this work but it crashes constantly. The controls are awkward because you have to click camera and then click to grab a saved photo. It also doesn\\'t line up the hair properly most of the time, leaving gaps. Don\\'t bother.",
