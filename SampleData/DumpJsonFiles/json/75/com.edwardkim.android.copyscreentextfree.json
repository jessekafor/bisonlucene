Take a picture and OCR that sucker of course! A working solution and a beautiful example of \\'winning ugly.\\'  It works thus far w/o a need to root the phone, but I\\'ve only put it through a few applications. I will change my font to a more easily OCR\\'d screen font. Corrections to processed text are necessary of course; as it\\'s an OCR program running on a limited processor. I haven\\'t used \\'network processing\\' to increase accuracy yet; I\\'m not sure I can take the performance hit. Before you complain about accuracy, please try adjusting your font. I\\'ll miss my custom font, but I\\'m willing to do what it takes to work-around another of Android\\'s design flaws. Why Android wasn\\'t written with the assumption that users should be able to copy character based text from any screen is beyond my ken. Serious kudos to Edward Kim for using the platform\\'s strengths to combat one of its weaknesses.",
