    "description": "An implementation of Bill James' formula as published in Slate in March 2008 (www.slate.com/id/2185975).  Just track the score, who has the ball, and how much time is left in the game, and the app will show you how safe the lead is.  The perfect accompaniment for March basketball games!The percentage changes to green and stays there once the lead is 100% safe: tap the percentage to reset the color for a new game.  Your phone's or tablet's volume buttons can be configured to add points for either team, start or stop the running clock, change possession, or subtract another 35 seconds off the clock.  Set the minutes and seconds then start the clock to count down the time along with the game clock to keep the percentage accurate as you watch.It's open source, ad-free, and doesn't require any permissions.  Enjoy!",
