        "comment": "Simple, simple app... but still useful to help keep you focused. The vibrating reminders are **from hell**, though-- don\\'t use them. My Desire Z would vibrate *constantly* when the time ran out. Exiting, killing the app, even *uninstalling* it didn\\'t stop the crazy buzzing! Thankfully, a reboot exorcised the demons. Reinstalled the app, and am happy enough with it now, using the audio-only notifications.",
