    "description": "The goal of Infinite dungeon is simple. Work you way from floor to floor searching for the stairway down to the next level while dispatching monsters and improving your equipment.This Trial version of the game includes all races and classes but only allows you to delve to level 15 â¦so more of a Finite Dungeon really.Infinite Dungeons levels are procedurally generated and are different every time you play but just to mix things up there are also over 70 pre-designed levels that the game will switch in which contain additional features like keys, doors and switches.Infinite Dungeon IncludesOver 80 different enemiesOver 75 Designed levelsOver 120 Unique Items38 spells3 difficulty settings4 Races and 3 ClassesMultiple Tiered achievementsFinally the game features end of section bosses on level 10,25,50,75 and 100! Infinite Dungeon is a Rogue Like / Roguelike at heart but has been designed so that anyone can enjoy it and with a control scheme that suits touch. All that's left is to ask is how far into the Infinite Dungeon can you delve? (Probably to level 15)",

        "comment": "I love portable RPGs, and I absolutely love the idea of a puzzle game masquerading as an RPG for a mobile device. That seems to be what Morrell is going for here, and while the mechanics are about as functional as they need to be (that is to say, no real difference from the days of Nethack), the game is not easy on the eyes. The developer could easily put a bit of polish into the game and give it a tileset that\\'s minimal, retro, and sleek; however in its current implementation it just looks like placeholder art, and the standard Android UI elements only further demonstrate this.  I will be more than happy to purchase this game and recommend it as soon as the developer hires someone to give his game a great tileset and UI.  I definitely believe this game has potential.",

        "comment": "I have several dungeon crawlers on my phone, yet I find myself returning to this one again and again.  Lots of monsters, tons of gear, a good variety of abilities all make this one a must-play.  My only complaint is that magic-users seem quite weak since magic needs crystals to replenish.  Maybe I\\'m missing something, but my warriors rip through everything while my wizards never make it past the first few levels.  More classes and races would be nice too.  Seriously though, great  game.",
