    "description": "The ultimate ARMA II DayZ mod guide for your mobile Android device. This application gathers all important maps, web links and utilities into a native Android application. All weapon, equipment, consumable, ammunition and vehicle information is integrated into the app for quick access. There's also a chatroom to text with your fellow players.Whether you need to check the Chernarus world map or see the stats of a weapon this is the way to go. You also have quick access to all DayZ social media including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. DayZ wiki is also only a couple of clicks away! A must have for any serious DayZ survivor. If you are keen on sniping there's also a sniper correction table there for your :)If you encounter any incompatibility or just have some questions feel free to contact me via email. Or by submitting a comment. This app has Google analytics enabled for anonymous data collection of which sections of the app are most used. This way I can focus on bettering the features people use the most. Don't forget to rate the app ;)VERSION HISTORY:v-2.31 (15.8.12)Chat no longer autoscrolls up, has AM/PM option for timestamp and no longer stays on between restarts. Youtube links should work almost everywhere on the app. Added Estonia and Israel flag to chat and hopefully fixed the app crashes on keyboard slideout bug. Dayzgame.com website added and broken websites removed. Bear trap picture added and Satchel Charge added to equipment explosives.v-2.30 (7.8.12) NOTE: B-version: Fixed some ICS problems.Lingor Island map is now added to the app! Also, the chat can be turned off to save data & battery. It's also much less active if you're not on the chat page. Now you can get your old ID back if you lose it by getting the donate version or reinstalling / clearing app data. I have also cleaned main settings a bit.v-2.27 (1.8.12)There is now private messaging feature on the chat. The app can now be transferred to SD and is a bit smaller in size. There has been added another offline map for those who can't view the HQ one. Legend has also been added to maps.v-2.26 (30.7.12)Did a memory fix checkbox for offline HQ map that fixes out of memory problem on some devices. Also added zoom in and out buttons for the map. Added country flags to chat. DayZ DB can now be found in browser under \"Wiki\".v-2.25 (28.7.12)New very HQ offline map, no more online map needed (except for older android versions). Also fixed weapon damage and audibility due to nerfing. Vehicle and aircraft controls aren't mixed up anymore.v-2.20 (24.7.12)Added \"Who's Online\" chat feature. Also unique chatter ID's for identification. Game hotkeys can now be found under Guides->Other->Game Controls. Also you can now toggle if you want the screen to stay on at the main settings page. Also fixed half-screen-white problem with some devices.v-2.10 (22.7.12)Added chat feature. Chat with your fellow players while you play. Great for discussing the game in general too.v-2.06 (19.7.12):Added bicycle info, height map, 3D map and changed list styles to suit app.v-2.05 (18.7.12):Added urls to website links & by-tags to maps. Database text size is now changeable. Integrated how to find north. Some minor bug fixes with a lot faster startup and offline maps should load quicker now :)v-2.0 (16.7.12):It is here. The completely redesigned leading DayZ Mobile app for Android. A lot of new maps, even better database and a plethora of interesting DayZ links right on your mobile device.",
