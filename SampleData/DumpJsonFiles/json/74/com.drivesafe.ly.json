I have contacted google yet it still says it is compatible with my device! News flash, it doesn\\'t work with Jelly Bean Google. Google should remove this from play, esp the pay one since it doesn\\'t work and the vendor does not refund. Now that I have worked around Play store I feel moving from Blackberry to Android was a mistake. BB app world was simple, if it was there it worked. Get it together!!",
