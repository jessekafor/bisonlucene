        "comment": "This app is a nice, straightforward, graphical presentation of the Bible verses of the \\\"Romans Road\\\" to salvation.  Everything about the app is great.  But the only (and maybe default) option I would give the user is the selection of Bible version.  It might reach a wider audience that way.  Copyright issues might be involved, but you could probably get permission for the English Standard Version. And, if not, the  public domain World English Bible or the NET version might be options.",
