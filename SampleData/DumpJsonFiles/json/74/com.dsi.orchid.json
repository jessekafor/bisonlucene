Our free cloud service that also works with this app and pricing for the paid cloud service have not changed. This pricing change was necessary to assure that we can continue to support our customers with the best possible products. After nearly three years of free service and two years of development time into our latest suite of products, it was clear that we could not continue with a completely free version of this app. Although our large user base is a complement to our products, it also generates a significant load on our services, which are costly to maintain. Keeping quality as the foremost goal, we decided to not introduce advertisements in our applications and instead introduce a straight-forward, simple, and reasonably priced subscription plan.",

        "comment": "I have Orchid running on the newest Nexus 7 tablet with Android 4.3 Jellybean and it runs flawlessly. I think that anyone looking for a convenient way to keep track of their business and their clients would love the Orchid app. This app helps you keep meticulous details of your business and makes you feel like you\\'re never too far from the shop, which is convenient for me as a business owner as I am always on call waiting for the next emergency at the shop that requires my help. But with all the administrative tools that Orchid gives me in the grips of my hands, I never feel too far away from the shop no matter how remote I may be. As long as I have a data or wireless connection, I can be miles away but still feel like I\\'m there with this app. Two thumbs up for Orchid. And another thing that is great about Orchid software is that their technical support lines are always based in the states for convenient help. I highly recommend anyone to try out Orchid to see what they\\'ve been missing.",
