It\\'s definitely not as easy as it would seem to be where you just load up some other ROM into a slot and walah, you can boot back and forth between them; 3/4 of the time things just don\\'t work. It\\'s way too slow in other cases, etc. Development is also very slow (as can be seen by it\\'s last release date in April, being the end of September now). I wouldn\\'t recommend buying this app until it\\'s much further along than it is, assuming it gets anymore development. it seems to have halted.",
