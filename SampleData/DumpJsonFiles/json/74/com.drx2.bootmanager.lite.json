We plan to update soon and will be working on the following: support for Galaxy Nexus JB, and Samsung Galaxy S3 support. If you would like to suggest other points to work on follow us at @init2winitapps on twitter and mention us to contact us. ==============================================Boot Manager Lite allows one extra slot and some features have been removed from the pro version. For UNLIMITED slots and disabled settings see the pro version.Boot Manager is Android's first multi-boot application. It allows you to install and boot ROMs from your sdcard and boot between then with just a reboot. The application acts as your recovery for your sdcard slots. Install your kernels, themes, and ROMs all through the app and use your normal recovery for your phone ROM only.IF YOU HAVE UPDATED SUPERUSER APK YOU NEED TO DISABLE LOGGING IN THE SUPERUSER APP. IT IS A BUG IN SUPERUSER AND WILL CAUSE ISSUES WITH BOOTMANAGERManual to the app athttp://init2winitapps.com/stories/BMManual.htmlPlease Read the Manual :) or see the tutorial video located there as wellCurrent Official Supported Devices (Devices can also be manually supported)Samsung Galaxy NexusHTC DesireHTC Desire HDHtc Desire SHTC Desire ZHtc Evo 3DHTC EVO 4GHTC G2(aka Vision)HTC Incredible 1Htc Incredible 2Htc Incredible SHTC Inspire4gHTC MyTouch 4GHTC Nexus OneHtc SensationHTC ThunderboltHTC RezoundMotorola Droid 1Motorola Droid 2Motorola Droid 2 GlobalMotorola Droid XMotorola RazrBootManager will not work with Samsung devices that are not listed because of the way Samsung handles the boot partition.

        "comment": "from the devs.  Until that time, from you.  I tried using this to install a second ROM on my phone, and that bit worked, but the ROM itself was incompatible.  No problem, and that\\'s what the software is supposed to make easy - get into recovery mode, flash the update.zip in from the slot I wanted to boot from instead (in this case, go back to the phone) and no worries.  Fail.  Continues booting rom1.  ok, pull the sdcard, go back to booting normally.  Fail.  Lock at first vendor screen.  OK, dupe a 4ext backup onto a blank sdcard, insert, boot to recovery, flash nandroid backup from a clean SDcard.  Fail, no boot.    Final resolution:  get into fastboot, flash boot.img and recovery.img into the boot and recovery partitions - now, my device boots. Restore the entire nandroid after reformatting, since obviously this software modified something very early in the boot process, reboot, phone is working again.    Much less work and hair pulling to simply have a good backup and overwrite the memory than to try and undo whatever this app did.",
