    "description": "Pathfinder, D&D 4E, 3.5E characters supportedFor a limited time, current users and anyone that purchases DnD Buddy get all the features free Including the Spells library, Magic Items library, Feats browser, 3.5 and Pathfinder support.Current Version: Supports creating characters from scratch, exported from D&D Insider online (4E) or even exported from the old software version.This app is optimized for both tablets and handheld screens (it automatically chooses the tablet version if your screen size is larger than 6\").  Get the HD and mobile in one app (and install it on both).This app is far less than the cost of one RPG book. Invest in me please?  I'd like to work on this more and I hope you would like to sponsor me a bit.  If you look at this apps history, you'll see in a short period, I've had many significant upgrades.  I'm an independent developer: help me raise a new generation of gamers that love roleplaying and Dungeons and Dragons games as much as we do!Coming soon:This is the first of 3 major updates coming!Almost done GM mode addon...-Encounter tracker-Monster library-Add Monsters from library into encounters-GM view mode: view screen with multiple characters key stats like everyone's perception values, initiative, skills and conditions.Player Tools addon:-Import libraries from Excel spreadsheets... want more spells, feats, or magic items?  Easy import.-Level up your characters and have the app guide you through it-More prestige classes comingOlder version history:v3.8-Automatic dice rollers on Power use.-Surge mod-Added \"Racial Traits\"-Heroic/Paragon Feats Details added-Dice Roller: click Menu > Dice. \"Save\" dice coming.Lastly, I obviously can't test on all devices but I'm quick to fix things if you can guide me a bit.
