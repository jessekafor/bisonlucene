    "description": "Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series written and illustrated by Japanese artist Masashi Kishimoto.  The manga was successfully adapted into anime series.What is the storyline about? It is the story about Naruto Uzumaki, teenager ninja who constantly searches for recognition and dreams to become the Hokage, the ninja in his village who is recognized as the leader and the strongest of all. Twelve years before the start of the story, the Nine-tailed Demon Fox brutally attacked ninja village Konoha. Fourth Hokage, the then leader of the village, sacrificed his life and sealed the demon inside the newborn child Naruto Uzumaki. A decree made by the current leader, the Third Hokage, forbade anyone to mention the attack of the Demon Fox to anyone else, including Naruto, who was not aware of the demon inside of him. After some years Naruto is tricked by the renegade ninja Mizuki and was involved into stealing a forbidden scroll with the secret ninja technique. Luckily he was stopped by his teacher, Iruka Umino. Mizuki also reveals that Naruto is the container for the Nine-tailed Demon Fox. Naruto uses the Jutsu doctrine, creates multiple clones of himself, by using Shadow Clone Technique, to defeat Mizuki. Afterwards Naruto is assigned alongside with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, to establish a three-person team, named Team 7, for completing various missions and fighting against various contraventions in village Konoha jurisdiction. After several successfully completed missions Team 7 is allowed to participate in special ninja exam in which this triad can advance to a higher rank, and thus, take part in more difficult missions with the new triple strength.
