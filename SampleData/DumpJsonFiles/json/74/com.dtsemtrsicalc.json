    "description": "For RN, EMTs, and Paramedics... not so much Anesthesiologists, but we can fix that...This program is intended to provide a quick reference to the drugs and dosages required to perform a Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI). It does NOT take the place of formal classes which teach this skill - you won't learn RSI from scratch by using this app.This app is designed to be stepped through rapidly - patient class (Adult, Pediatric, or Geriatric); patient weight in pounds or kgs, or Broselow tape if pediatric; finally, patient health considerations - does this patient have an intracranial bleed?  Is this patient hypotensive? Should hyperkalemia be suspected? - finally, here are your drugs and dosages.Any preassessment should be performed prior to attempting an intubation (LEMONS, BONES, Mallampati scoring, etc.)Tap Menu -> Help for further information, and remember always to stick to your protocols.This is Betterware; if you can think of any way to make it better, please drop me a suggestion at DTsEMT@gmail.com, and Thanks!",
