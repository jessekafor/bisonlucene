    "description": "Over/Under Bet Calculator is here just in time for you to monitor your over under bets for high scoring basketball games.  Of course it also works with other sports like football, soccer, and hockey.Always know how the game compares to the over under bet score in up to three consecutive games.  The O/U Bet Calculator uses a linear algorithm to estimate the final game score based on your inputs:-\tTotal game time.-\tTime remaining in the game.-\tThe score for each team.-\tAnd, with the bet score entered, the predicted game score will be red if it is over the bet score, or blue if it is below the bet score.Just tap each number input number to edit the number or time.Change from one game to the next by hitting the game selection buttons at the bottom of the screen.Tips:  - If you don't want to enter both team scores: You can add the two scores together and only enter the total score, leaving the other team score at 0.  The predicted score will still be correct.- If the game goes into overtime and it counts in the total bet score, then add the overtime period into total game time setting.Please email info@droidtoolworks.com with questions, comments, and suggestions.",
