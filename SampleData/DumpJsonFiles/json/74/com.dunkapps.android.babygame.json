    "description": "Why babies are so amazed by our rattles toy application? Let me provide you with some explanation and answers to this question. Rattles Toy have been one of the first toys that babies liked to play with. They are simple toys designed to stimulate babyâs development through the sense of sight, sound and touch. Babies like the sounds and with their eyes try to follow the path of the rattle while it is shaking. Rattles are a sensory treat for babies from the age of newborn to 2.5 years old child. A newborn's vision is still under development for several months. It leads newborns to become more of auditory learners. Facing baby rattles for the first time infants may not even see the toy clearly. They begin to realize that a world outside of them does exist, and they can interact with the toy through the grasping instinct. Gripping the rattle and creating familiar sounds gives very young infants the first understanding of a âsubject â objectâ world.Another important stage in infant's development is cause and effect. Baby rattles are designed to perform consistently, so a baby soon learns that there is a direct relationship between the actions and the desired result. If infants were presented with a rattle that didn't make a sound, they would become very confused and frustrated. Different toys with different sounds stimulate baby's natural sense of curiosity. This idea of different causes and effects leads to other early aged infancy toys, such as mobiles and activity boards.Rattles also provide entertainment for babies and encourage them to explore more. Babies feel the sense of discovering something as they try to grab and hold the rattles toy. They love to explore and rattles provide just the right opportunity to do so.Now with the rattle toy in your phone you can amuse and entertain your child anywhere you want.
