Our free cloud service that also works with this app and pricing for the paid cloud service have not changed. This pricing change was necessary to assure that we can continue to support our customers with the best possible products. After nearly three years of free service and two years of development time into our latest suite of products, it was clear that we could not continue with a completely free version of this app. Although our large user base is a complement to our products, it also generates a significant load on our services, which are costly to maintain. Keeping quality as the foremost goal, we decided to not introduce advertisements in our applications and instead introduce a straight-forward, simple, and reasonably priced subscription plan.",

I was a little concerned at first as to whether 123Pet would run on the newest Android OS, but fear not because it runs flawlessly on this newest update! I think that anyone looking for a convenient way to keep track of their business and their client\\'s pets is going to love the 123Pet app. Giving care to other people\\'s animals requires precise methods and note taking for a quality job. This app helps me keep those meticulous details of these pets with the ability to easily access this information later on when needed. All the administrative tools that a business owner needs, right inside the palms of my hands, wherever I am! You can\\'t lose out trying 123Pet out!",
