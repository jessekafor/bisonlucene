        "comment": "This it\\'s a fun app that attempts to bring to Starbucks e variety of flavors available previously in only independent coffee houses.  But there are only a few free drink ideas... they require us to purchase the full app to get more.  But the first thing THEY REALLY need to fix is sizes. Starbucks doesn\\'t have small,  medium and large.  They have short,  tall,  Grande and venti (plus the two secret sizes on each end of the Range). That is a basic detail they need to get right first!  Fun idea.",
