    "description": "Are you feeling tired from long and difficult working day? Or probably canât sleep after exhausting day, having headache, tinnitus or suffer from insomnia? Just want to relax and feel better? Engage your imagination and see Blue Ocean, small waves, beautiful creek, seagulls, golden sand beach, palms, nature melodies and windstorm. Or maybe tropical rainforest, rain falling from the big green leaves, brook; countryside surroundings in the north, beautiful nature. Now close your eyes and try to hear it with our application. This is how relaxing therapy sounds. Sounds have been used as healing or calming tools for thousands of years. An interesting thing about relaxing ocean sounds is that people actually like them more than the music produced by a billion dollar industry. If you think about it, music is very subjective - usually people like some genres and dislikes others and there is no music that everybody likes. However relaxing nature ocean sounds get much wider appreciation - it is hard to find a person that does not like the relaxing sound of beach waves crashing against the shore or seagull sounds in the beach.Why is that? Perhaps because being in nature, surrounded by pure acoustics of the environment, gives a feeling of overwhelming calm that is hard to experience in urban surroundings. Probably that is related to a human brain reacting positively when exposed to relaxing beach or ocean sounds. Actually, nature is our ancient environment, so the emotions it produces in our brain with its sounds are among most pleasurable and feels somewhat like âreturning homeâ. So being in nature or listening to relaxing nature oceans  sounds can be a great stress relief for the brain, since it is basically coded and shaped at times deep in prehistory when human communities were living in an environment of such sounds.RELAXING SLEEP SOUNDS WEBPAGES REVIEW:Countryside sleeps melody:Best anti stress for me, i just listen oceans, seagull, rainforest or other sound and my headache goes away.
