    "description": "This application will calculate the ECONOMIC BALANCE POINT temperature of a Dual Fuel Heat Pump system with a natural gas (NG), propane (LP) or fuel oil back-up furnace. This app will help HVAC contractors find the economic balance point to properly set-up a customers dual fuel heat pump system. This app does not calculate the Thermal Balance Point which is just as important when setting up a dual fuel heat pump system. With the high cost of Fuel Oil and Propane and low cost of electric, these systems would likely be set at the Thermal Balance Point.Before using this app you must have: the COP47 and COP17 heat ratings for the Heat Pumpthe AFUE% of the Furnace (If 80% enter .80)the cost of Electric ($ / kWh)the cost of Fuel ($ / Therm) - (NG use cost / CCF) (LP and Oil use cost / gallon)DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE ABOVE INFO.ECONOMIC BALANCE POINT  -the lowest outdoor temperature where theheat pump, based on current fuel and electric rates, heats at a lowercost than the furnace.THERMAL BALANCE POINT -the outdoor temperature at which theheating load exactly matches the heating capability of the heat pump.",
