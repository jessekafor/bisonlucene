        "comment": "Measure uses trigonometry to determine distance by calculating the side of a right triangle. Understanding this with a few tips leads to surprisingly accurate measurements. The instructions say to hold the device 5 ft high. So one time i used a tape measure to find out 5 ft came to neck high for me. Now i know where to hold my tablet. Then the instructions say to aim the camera at the base of the object you want to determine the distance to. But if the object is on a slope, point to the spot on the object directly opposite your toes. Then hold your device steady to get your accurate measurement.",

        "comment": "This app demonstrates making use of the camera and other sensors on Android devices to gather information about the physical environment.  With this knowledge Android apps can do all types of smart things, from being a game controller, smart mouse to motion based recognition.  The possibilities are endless, and this is how humans will interact with computers in the future!",
