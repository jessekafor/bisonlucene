        "comment": "This app is great! But for the price, which is pretty steep to be honest, I would love to have more capabilities. Weather, time of day, some live elements like wild life, moving water,fish, etc. The perspective on several of the buildings is off, but the sheer artistic work and beauty behind them makes it not matter. What would be really awesome is to have elements like rake-able sand. Waterfalls would be amazing, too! The art has great character. Bringing all that to life would be well worth the $6+ for the expansions, and would make this app just astoundingly beautiful and extremely fun. When I\\'m done making my garden, that\\'s it, im done. Love elements would make me want to stick around and get totally lost in my creation. having said all of this, I really appreciate yalls hard work and it definitely shows!",
