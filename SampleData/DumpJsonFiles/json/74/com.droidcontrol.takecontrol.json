    "description": "Note: For some reason TC doesn't work well with some Samsung phones/tablets. Please Try Lite (free) version first.Important node: TC requires your phone or tablet to be ROOTED (with Superuser/SuperSU and BussyBox installed)!TakeControl lets you control your Android phone with Windows keyboard and mouse. Just move the cursor to the edge of the screen, and it will âcrossâ to your phone allowing you to control it. Typing or playing games on your phone or tablet has never been easier. And if you are worried about foreign letters, donât be, because TakeControl supports 164 different keyboard localizations to suit all your needs. Clipboard is shared; multiple devices are supported and auto-connect feature lets you relax knowing that your phone is always within the reach of your keyboard and mouse.All this makes TakeControl unique application on the market. There is no need for browser or VNC client. All you need is keyboard and a mouse.To get started:1. Go to droidcontrol.com and download and start TakeControl.exe2. Start TakeControl on your phone, type in IP address of Windows PC and press Connect. Superuser should pop out which should be allowed.3. That is it - you have TakeControl.Hope, youâll enjoy TakeControl!For more information, please visit droidcontrol.comTake Control",

        "comment": "Hi, this is a great product, and is the only way I\\'ve got \\'Synergy\\'-like functions on my phone (virtual KVM).  Some suggestion to make it even better: 1. Use DNS name, not IP address to connect - my DHCP will change the IP address eventually! 2. Support for landscape - I plug in to HDMI, and phone goes landscape, and TakeControl get confused, thinks still in portrait 3. Auto-connect at phone boot - so ready to control phone (I \\'dock\\' my phone at home/work, and it would act like another screen, ready to go as soon as in WiFi range - I use Tasker to detect SSID and launch TakeControl - like a proximity detector)",

        "comment": "--Update to Review-- Developer no longer responds to my e-mails about bugs or feature requests, or to support the app. I am still not able to access the notifications bar, the app drops connection regularly, and no longer seems to be in development. Uninstalling and unhappy due to lack of support. There are alternatives on the Store right now that work much better. --End Update--  This is a fantastic product that works very well for something so new. Tablet is docked next to my screen and the cursor flows over there without a problem.  There\\'s a couple of bugs (costing that fifth star). I\\'ve had issues where the tablet keeps reconnecting even though the connection hasn\\'t actually dropped. It also doesn\\'t allow me to access my notifications bar at the bottom of my tablet\\'s screen (I\\'m limited to the actual desktop itself). I\\'m sure that these are bugs that will be worked out.  The only technical downfall is that on my Tablet S, the cursor is not smooth, so I\\'ve had to increase the acceleration to make it seem smooth and usable. This is a great start, though. An excellent program that deserves two thumbs up.",

Support for different keyboards is great, however there are still some problems with Caps/Num Lock synchronization - sometimes they just fall out of sync. Other that that, everything works smoothly.",
