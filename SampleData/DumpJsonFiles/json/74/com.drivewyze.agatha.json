    "description": "The Drivewyze PreClearâ¢ app enables commercial truck drivers to bypass Drivewyze-supported inspection sites or weigh stations. Youâll save time, money and fuel.  On average, you can expect to receive bypass permissions between 50% - 75% of the time, no matter what your carrier safety score. And if you have a very good carrier safety score, you may could receive bypasses up to 98% of the time. Drivewyze PreClear is supported in 16 statesâcheck out the list in the tour to see if it is available where you drive.If you want to spend less time waiting at weigh stations and more time driving, Drivewyze PreClear is for you.  Hereâs how it works.  It uses Android GPS technology to automatically detect upcoming weigh stations.  If youâre encountering a Drivewyze-supported site, the service alerts you when your vehicle is 2 miles from the station.  One mile out, the app notifies you to either bypass or follow road signs.  Itâs that easy.   Drivewyze PreClear turns your smartphone or tablet into a next generation bypass transponder.Drivewyze PreClear does not require any additional hardware, aside from your smartphone or tablet. Download the app to begin a 60-day, hassle free trial and start receiving bypasses.  The app walks you through the enrollment process.  You just enter your license plate # and DOT registration, and snap a photo of your truck.  When you approach your first Drivewyze-supported weigh station, youâll be instructed to pull-in to activate your account.  After that, youâll start receiving bypasses.   Youâll see for yourself the time and hassles you save.  At the end of your free trial, simply set up your subscription to keep receiving bypasses.Requirements:Users must also have active cellular data connection and allow access to GPS.Drivewyze PreClear Supported States: Arkansas, Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West VirginiaFor a complete list of active sites, please visit http://drivewyze.com/coverage-map/.Keywords:weigh station, truck services, inspection sites, trucker app, trucking, weigh station locator, fleet optimization, truck driver, e-screening, transportation, intrastate, interstate, pull-in, FMCSA compliant, transponder, DOT, bypass program, Drivewise, Drivewize, Drivewyse, weigh scale, CAT scale, weigh station bypass, prepass, bypass service, trucker, fleet management, commercial vehicle, truck scale, preclearance",
