        "comment": "I\\'ve always liked the HTC Sense look. This widget can give any android device the same slick appearance. The weather and clock are accurate, and the customizable app launchers make up for taking up two rows of your home screen. (There is a smaller one x one widget available). Many options to customize appearance, as well. Ads are minimal on the weather screen. Great free app, five stars!",
