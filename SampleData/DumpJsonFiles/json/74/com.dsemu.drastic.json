However some features I\\'d like to see implemented are bluetooth/wi-fi linking, swipe on and off touch controls, perhaps building in a gba/gbc emulator could be considered so its an all in one package, the ability to delete or add buttons when customizing the touch controls, perhaps the addition of a turbo a/b button for the built in touch controls. Keep it up devs!",
