    "description": "Longbow is a fun and challenging 3D archery game for phones and tablet devices.Adjust your aim, draw your arrow, and strike distant targets to score big!Shoot for the bullseye in the village, knock over targets on the castle wall, or destroy barrels from horseback along the 4 mile stretch of mountainous terrain. Longbow's three distinct stages are easy to learn but challenging to master. You'll need to consider the wind, distance, and even your trusty steed's speed to consistently score high! Can you shoot an apple off someone's head? Turn a scarecrow into a pin cushion? These challenges and more await!â Use your fingers to aim and draw your bow. â Three difficulty levels for each game mode. (Try expert mode for an extra challenge!)â On-line leaderboards!â Detailed 3D graphics and sound!â Looks great on phones and tablets!Can you master the bow and become a true archer?HOW TO PLAY:Slide one finger across the screen to aim. Press the arrow icon in the corner to draw your bow. Release the button to fire.In village mode:Check the wind speed and direction in the top left corner of the screen. At the highest difficulty level, the swaying trees, sound of the wind, and dust kicked up by gusts will be your only clues.Expert mode removes the bow cross-hairs and wind speed from the screen. You'll need to use experience and intuition to score big!You can earn an extra 10 points if you manage to strike the apple (...not the Adam's apple) in the bonus round.In castle mode:Each round is 90 seconds long.Shoot all targets in a set quickly to score big!Striking the scarecrow awards bonus points at the end of a round depending where the arrows hit.Accuracy is important!In horse archery mode:Shoot the targets along the highland circuit.The further away you are when the arrow hits a target, the more bonus points are awarded.Keep striking targets to maximize the bonus awarded.Higher difficulty levels increase the horse's speed.",
