        "comment": "Yes, as someone said below, there are a lot of similarities between Crusade of Destiny and Earth & Legend... but there are more than enough differences to make them both fun. The fact that one guy seems to have done both games pretty much single-handed blows my mind and frankly puts a lot of software \\\"giants\\\" to shame. Keep these games coming and I will not only keep buying them I will plead with anyone who will listen to do the same. This is the sort of game designer that actually DESERVES our support!!!",

        "comment": "I have an Optimus p500 with 2.3 android (un-rooted) and this game runs pretty good considering the phone only has a 600mhz processor.  It lags a little bit when in a populated area.  I have searched all over the market for a decent 3D RPG for this phone and by the looks of it, this game is as good as it gets.  Earth and Legend is a no-go for this phone, way too laggy.  Unless you root your phone.  That aside, its a standard rpg experiance, leveling, grinding, skills, quests and all that jazz. I have only played the first area so far and I am happy with this purchase.  Only suggestion I would make to developers is to add a mini-map with quest icons or trackers.  I will update if the game gets progressively worse lag-wise.  Again, this lag is from my device, not the game itself.  Oh and the controls are pretty good too, in my opinion.  Cheers.",

Also at lv 9 buy town map go to goblin lair. Which is very nice.  Anyway I have played many mmorps. (pwi) this rpg game is  worth 5 dollars glad I got it.

The story is shallow, the graphics are suprisingly blocky and devoid of detail, and the gameplay is monotonous.  The game\\'s barely existent story literally cannot be furthered without repeated boring combat to attain enough strength to fight the next mediocre crop of enemies.  As a free game, this style of gameplay would be passable at best. Fun for a few hours and boring the next.Playtime 6.5 hours. Thanks.",
