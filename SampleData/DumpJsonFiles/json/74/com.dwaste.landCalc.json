    "description": "LandVol is a tool developed by D-Waste, to support waste managers to roughly estimate the Landfill Volume (without final cover) and the required Active Landfill Area (the surface of a landfill used exclusively for waste disposal, without landfill lining layers, surrounding roads and other infrastructure) for the final disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). This application takes into consideration all the necessary data that affect the Landfill Volume and Area. It also makes an assessment of the expected waste body settlements and demonstrates the impacts of the various operational features in the calculated parameters.",
