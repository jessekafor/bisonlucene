    "description": "This excellent Dinosaurs themed game, \"Dinosaurs Sequence\", is going to help you as it will allow you to practice your intellectual facilities and concentration.The game contains two modes: Practice and Challenge.In the Practice game mode, there are three levels to choose from: Easy, Normal and Hard. They vary in terms of the number of dinosaurs (3, 4 or 5) whose order of appearance the player must remember. If you choose this game mode, you must remember the order in which dinosaurs, shown later on the plates below, appear on the screen. Touch the screen, the plates go blank and you must indicate dinosaurs you see in the same order as they appeared on the plates. Easy, isn't it?Once you become skilled, try something more difficult and go to the Challenge game mode. In this mode, you must remember in which order dinosaurs appear on the screen and then indicate them in exactly the same order. Each sequence which you remember correctly earns you a point.Scoreloop is available. So you can compete for the first place in the ranking of the world's best players.",
