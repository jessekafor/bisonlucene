Needs improvement on screen grid alignment, though. Like many things on Android, placement/alignment on the screen grid is goofy. But, its \\\"extra goofy\\' with this app. The \\'Texts\\' you place take up a lot of elbow room on the screen grid, & step on your other widgets & push them around. Can\\'t place close to other widgets without interfetence.",

I worked around this by using Apex launcher and just resizing so you can get 2 next to each other, but other than that its great.",
