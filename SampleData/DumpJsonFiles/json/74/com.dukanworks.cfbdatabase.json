This app lets you dig for information like that yourself. When was the last time Notre Dame scored 50 points in a game? The last time USC lost a bowl game? How long has it been since SMU beat Texas? The answers are here. (This feature not available in free version of the app.)* Season RecordsChoose a team and season to view cumulative and game results.

(This feature not available in free version of the app.)* Top Teams by DecadeFind the schools with the best 10-year runs in college football history. Alabama? Nebraska? Boise State? Depends on the decade.* Bowl SearchDetermine when your team went bowling, how they fared and when they spent the holidays at home. Or review all bowl results, from the big contests all the way down to the games sponsored by some dot-com that's now out of business.* National ChampionshipsComplete historical listings of the three major ranking systems: The AP Poll, Coaches Poll and Bowl Championship Series.",
