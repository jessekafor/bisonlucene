Takes too long to get new beasts, used to be fun but now its more of a chore to play this. I\\'d spend and extra five to ten minutes getting stuff done around the house then messing with this. Don\\'t want to delete it but I\\'m thinking of it. I just read some other reviews and they haven\\'t got deep into the game. Starts fast and fun then slows to a snails pace. Keep it fun",
