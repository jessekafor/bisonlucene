    "description": "Your derriere isn't the only thing that should be well rounded: Your fitness workouts should be, too. Which is why WH asked fitness experts for their favorite glute-shaping moves. Do the exercises twice a week, and add 30 minutes of cardio three times each week to burn fat and make sure your back-porch swing remains a two-seater.That means a large amount of their prep work happens in the weight room, not on the slopes. \"Ski patrollers' gym workouts are truly a model for how to build not only an ideal physique but also the functional fitness, power, and endurance required to sustain a 13-hour workday on the mountain,\" says John Cole, director of human performance at the Ski & Snowboard Club Vail in Colorado. By using their training methods, you can reap a leaner, tighter,stronger body (most notably your legs and butt) even if you have no plans to hit the slopes.Follow this patroller-inspired workout, created by Cole, one to three times a week on nonconsecutive days. Complete three sets of the first move, resting as little as possible between each set. Rest one minute, then continue until you've finished all the legs and butt exercises. (Start with light weights until you can get through every exercise with proper form.)Keywords:leg and butt workouts,leg workouts, butt workout, workouts, womens fitness, ladies workouts,Daily Leg Workout,Daily Butt Workout,Daily Ab Workout,Daily Leg Workout,Daily Arm Workout,Daily Cardio Workout,Daily Workouts,Daily Workouts,Ladies' Leg Workout,Ladies' Butt Workout,womens fitness, womens workouts, workouts, sixpack, dailyworkouts, yoga, fitness,sex workouts,health, gym, Daily Butt Workout, Exercise Legs, Workout Trainer, Daily Cardio Workout, Exercise whole body lean, loose belly fat, fat, stomach fat, slim down, 42 best ways to loose stomach fat, loose stomach fat,belly, trim belly, muffin top, loose weight, slim, reduce stomach, reduce fat, fat, lean legs, legs, tight butt, butt, workouts, exercises, flat abs, moves, lower-body strength, burn fat, Butt Sculpting Exercises, Butt Exercises, Butt Workouts, Butt Toning, Butt Sculpting, Butt, ladies home workouts, ladies workouts, ladies exercise, home exercise,Abs, exercise, health, fitness, gym, workouts, six pack, sit ups, abdominal, muscles, Abdominal exercises, strength,Workouts, Body Workouts, Lower Body Workouts, Lower Body, Body Toning, Body Exercises, Exercises, Arm Workouts, Workouts, Exercise, Arm Jiggle Workouts, Arm Exercises, Arm,Fat burn , fat loss, loss calories, Loss weight, Fat, Calories, Burn Fat, Burn Calories,No equipment workouts, workouts, womens fitness, sixpack,sixapack, Workout Trainer, Daily Ab Workout, Circuit Training Assistant, stretch exercises, stretching, exercises, body stretch, workouts, fitness, muscles, health, Stretch Exercises, fitness guru, fitness, sixpacks ,sixpack, yoga,womens fitness, womens workouts, workouts, sixpack, dailyworkouts, yoga, fitness,sex workouts,health, gym, Daily Butt Workout, Exercise Legs, Workout Trainer, Daily Cardio Workout, Exercise whole body lean, loose belly fat, fat, stomach fat, slim down, 42 best ways to loose stomach fat, loose stomach fat,belly, trim belly, muffin top, loose weight, slim, reduce stomach, reduce fat, fat, lean legs, legs, tight butt, butt, workouts, exercises, flat abs, moves, lower-body strength, burn fat, Butt Sculpting Exercises, Butt Exercises, Butt Workouts, Butt Toning, Butt Sculpting, Butt",
