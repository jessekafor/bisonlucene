    "description": "The goal of Infinite dungeon is simple. Work your way from floor to floor searching for the stairway down to the next level while dispatching monsters and improving your equipment.Infinite Dungeons levels are procedurally generated and are different every time you play but just to mix things up there are also over 75 pre-designed levels that the game will switch in which contain additional features like keys, doors and switches.Infinite Dungeon IncludesOver 80 different enemiesOver 75 Designed levelsOver 120 Unique Items38 spells3 difficulty settings4 Races and 3 ClassesMultiple Tiered achievementsFinally the game features end of section bosses on level 10,25,50,75 and 100! Infinite Dungeon is a Rogue Like / Roguelike at heart but has been designed so that anyone can enjoy it and with a control scheme that suits touch. All that's left is to ask is how far into the Infinite Dungeon can you delve?(!!Note) - There is a known issue with the Galaxy S3 which may also affect other high resolution phones. The controls do not display correctly and it crashes in landscape. please try the demo first to ensure it runs acceptably. You can change the control method from the menu and play in portrait to somewhat get around the problem but it is far from ideal.",

There are some balancing issues (mainly a few creatures that lack balance when in large numbers), a lack of description on stats (which is better, 10 damage or 10 armor pen?) and an annoying bug where an enemy\\'s remains can destroy your exit; however, even with all of that, it\\'s still an addicting game.    I\\'m giving it a 4* overall; the balancing issues and lack of stat information keep it from a 5.",
