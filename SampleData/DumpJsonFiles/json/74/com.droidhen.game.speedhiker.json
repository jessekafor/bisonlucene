    "description": "Speed hikers are racing on the mountain. But running is not fast enough, hikers have to fly!All of the magic is GRAVITY.The gravity increases when screen is touched, and it restores to normal when released.The game rule is very simple, but how fast hikers run will completey depend on your skill.Some tips may be helpful:# Touch to acclerate speed on declivity.# Release to make hikers fly on acclivity.# Fine tuning gravity when hikers are flying.# BOOST is very helpful when you fall behind.Good luck of your trip!",

A scoreboard type thing that could track your progress against others.  A way to customize characters (colors if nothing else).  And ability to win crystals a little easier.  Currently its nearly impossible to win your way to all of your upgrades.",

Please add some metrics to the upgrades, so we know exactly what we are going from and getting to (e.g. +4% speed, etc)  Please make three big ramp interact the same as other ramps and not act as an instant acceleration pad. Thus is punishing to players who are ahead, but happen to be on the way up from a big swing just as the hill appears.",
