        "comment": "I love this and the Starlight Live Wallpaper by Jason Allen/Anne Patzke.  The wallpaper itself is very smooth.  I love the lanterns and the clouds (although it\\'s physically weird for the wind to be blowing simultaneously in different directions).  My only gripe is that the wallpaper seems to glitch out my screen in patches when I\\'m in a full screen program.  This occurs a lot with things like my eReader apps.  The glitch goes away when I nudge my page to smooth out the white space/words.  The areas on the screen where this happens is right in the path of the moving clouds.  This is not something that occurs with the Starlight LWP that I used to use prior to switching to Passage LWP.  Should this glitching be addressed, I\\'d definitely give 5 stars.",
