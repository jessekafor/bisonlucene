    "description": "A simple, configurable dice roller. Intended for RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons but can be used for any game that requires dice.Dice Bag is a free, fully featured, zero advertisement application. Built for the serious gamer who prefers customization and features over pretty colors. Players and GMs can pre-program all their rolls in advance and never interrupt the flow of battle by looking up exact damage or hit bonuses.Its intention is not to replace the fun and excitement of real dice. Instead DiceBag provides an alternative when dice get forgotten or misplaced. Also great for that spontaneous session. Current features include:- Result history log.- Profiles for different characters/games.- Custom dice types for n-sided dice.- Options such as exploding, drop lowest, penetrating, brutal and keep dice.- Dice Combinations.- Profile and Dice exporting and importing",

When I stumbled upon this I was simply looking for an app that let me roll with a tap instead of physically rolling every time, as many rolls are not ment for players eyes but this app does so much more. I thank the developers for making this. My only suggestion is that you make an app that allows you to record tables and formulas for games also. That would be awsome. Great app tho",
