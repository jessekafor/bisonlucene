    "description": "â Be sure to check out the youtube video of the app! âToday's technology already allow drivers to be guided by a GPS. To take this a step further, this app provides a system to monitor and analyze the driving quality by using the accelerometer (G-sensor) of your smartphone. This will help you determine if the driving is good or bad, helping you improving your own driving skills. Hence the name \"Driving Skill Monitor\" (DriSMo). The goal of this application is to emphasize the attention towards good driving quality and make the drivers aware of their own driving quality. By raising the awareness of driving quality, you can increase the quality of driving. Fuel efficiency will also be improved, as a result.Features:â Advanced quality monitoring  - Multiple monitor views  - Realtime quality feedback  - Text to speech supported (English only)â Retrospective trip analysis  - Quality graph  - Quality rating and general trip information  - Map view, including quality trackâ Map and GPS-trackingâ SMS auto-replyâ Power-saving optionâ Export quality data (CSV file)â Share your trip on FacebookFields of use:â Show off your driving skills, and compare them to other friends.â Prove that your car is of good quality, and that it is comfortable driving.â Measure acceleration, by using the debug monitor.â Save money on gas, by driving more smoothly! DriSMo is Open Source, and you can find the project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/drismo/ or check out the code at GitHub @ https://github.com/jmyrland/DriSMo.Found a bug/Got a feature request? Send us mail! :)Why all the permissions?â¢ Internett access: For downloading the map, and (if you want to) for posting to FB.â¢ Send SMS/Read SMS: If enabled, DriSMo will repsond to incoming messages with a predefined message.â¢ Read location (GPS): This is used to spot where you are, so the app can log and display the location on a map.â¢ Read phone state and incoming calls: If enabled, this is used to send a predefined message to incoming calls, to let them know you are driving.â¢ Storage and saving to SD-card: To log each trip, DriSMo saves a file for each trip on the SD-card.â¢ System tools: To prevent the phone from sleeping when assessing driving quality, and for running DriSMo in the background when driving.â¢ Control vibrator: To turn off the vibrator when assessing driving quality.-Ignore this-Keywords: vehicle, car, driving, ride, quality, skill, smooth driving, driving skill, car dock, car app, andicar, accelerometer, tracker, GPS, Waze, Google maps, Open Street Map, OSM, Navigator, Speedometer, HUD, g-forces, comparison, sms autoreply, facebook sharing, google+, g+, google plus,  drivesafe.ly, safe drive, car home, dashboard, speed watcher, careful driver.This is a real driving app, unlike smartphone simulation games like Drag Racing, Drift Mania, NEED FOR SPEED, Head To Head Racing, Championship Lite, Jet Car Stunts, Raging Thunder, Car Conductor, and other cool games!This app senses and analyzes the driving dynamics, not just visualizing and recording the speed and video, such as DailyRoads Voyager, AutoBoy BlackBox, SpeedView, Ulysse Speedometer, Ulysse Gizmos and other cool apps.This app puts focus on how people drive, not so much where people drive like some great navigation apps like VZ Navigator, My Verizon, waze, navigator by Verizon Wireless, my T-Mobile, iGo, AT&T navigator, Maverick, Sygic, Here I Am, Google Map Navigation, NAVIGON MobileNavigator, Beat the Traffic, Traffic Jam, RAC Traffic, and other cool apps.",

        "comment": "As a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, I want to find a program to monitor my driving. Unfortunately this is far from being it. It confuses bad road surfaces with bad driving. Driving up or down steep hills gives you a negative score and anything over a medium acceleration puts you in the red again. Taking a corner at more than 5 miles an hour gets you in the red too. Maybe this works well in suburban environments with perfect road surfaces in a car with incredibly soft suspension but in the UK countryside, forget it. If you really want to know how well you drive, talk to the IAM or ROSPA, this app is useless. (Phone is a stock galaxy S3. Test vehicle Daewoo Musso over 52.5 miles and Nissan Primera over 31.4 miles).",
