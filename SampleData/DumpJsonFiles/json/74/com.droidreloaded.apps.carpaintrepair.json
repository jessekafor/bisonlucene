        "comment": "This app is complete junk!!! It tells you a cheap fix that\\'s only a band aid. spray cans are only lacquer or enamel which do not hold up to UV rays or weather elements! Fix for a short time.dulling down or die back will always occur using non activated materials.leave it to the pros and stop being cheap.body repair is an Art and can\\'t be taught by an app.bty rust must be blasted not just removed with a grinder! Lol if you own a 1984 Ford escort this is a great app. Leave it to the pros! People crack me up!",

        "comment": "Thick rust, and rust right through the metal is simple to remove, grind out all rusty metal, clean up, fill with filler. Sand back. Fill imperfections and re-sand, repeat until perfect. Primer, paint, clear coat. Polish. SIMPLE! Just did my car and its perfect. 1 star for not maning up and tackling rust, and shame on you for acting like you know what your on about then telling people to use a bodyshop for rust that is easy to fix.",
