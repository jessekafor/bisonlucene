    "description": "Eating your meals too quickly is not good for your health, and is a difficult habit to break. Eat Slower can help!Eat Slower provides an adjustable timer which you can use to pace yourself while you eat. Each time the timer elapses, you are allowed to take a bite of your meal.By pacing yourself while eating, you are encouraged to chew your food more thoroughly, enjoy your food longer, and give your body more time to signal you that you are full, helping to prevent overeating.You can adjust or pause the timer while you are eating. Choose from several different sounds to alert you to take your next bite, or turn the sounds off and just use the vibrate feature (helpful for keeping your device concealed while eating with family and friends).Use it for every meal!",

        "comment": "Great app, but this should be able to run in the background and also an overall timer for the meal itself adjustable in minutes from 15 to 30 would help immensely!! Please make these changes and you will be the most unique app of its kind.",
