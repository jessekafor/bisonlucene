    "description": "Palm Guitar is a simple and easy to use Guitar application. nothing fancy, no overdrive effects or anything like that, but if I have time I will update frequently and make this app much much better. Palm Guitar is the very first app to come out by DSNJrDev and I would really appreciate your feedback. This is not a top quality application but I would like your help to make it so. If I could get support for my developing I will be able to make this Way better than it is right now.Updates to come: Will add more frets, at least to 9th fret, anymore seems to reduntant, email me if you think otherwise and I will go ahead and i will do at least to 12th fret.",
