        "comment": "I own several different types of palms, and as a novice this app was a great tool picking out palms and the very basics.  It would be so much better if it had more in depth care practices for each individual palm.  It would be great if it had contacts that you could consult and even a user message board to discuss information with other growers.  And if the articles were updated once in while would be tremendously help full!  Other than that its a great place to start for beginers.   Thank you!",
