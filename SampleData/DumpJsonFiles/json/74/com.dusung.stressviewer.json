        "comment": "I would have expected the app to simply give me heart readings, NOT to diagnose me. It said that I have Early Arrhythmia which is quite absurd, as my last checkup / ECG didn\\'t prompt any concerns to doctors.  I find this app very abusive to attempt to diagnose a user, which for a moment caused some distress until I realized how stupid and crap this application was.  DO NOT INSTALL IT !!  You\\'ll save a days worries that I went through.",
