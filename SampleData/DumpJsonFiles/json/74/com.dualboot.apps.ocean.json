I bought the shark pack (excellent value at 75p) and all I can say is its complete transformed the wallpaper!  Although the live wallpaper is stunning it gets a but samey after a while, the shark pack has transformed that!  All it needs now is maybe some different design of fish and maybe some different behaviour of the fish, perhaps interraccting with the scenery and other fish",
