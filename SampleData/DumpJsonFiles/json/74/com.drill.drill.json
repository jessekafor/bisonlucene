    "description": "Professor-Drill is a very neatly arranged language or vocabulary trainer. Create your own lessons, divide them into groups and lessons and practice in many different ways. Your  personal knowledge level is taken into account per lesson and for each question: You can see at a glance which lessons you must repeat more often and you will be asked only those questions you answered not well in the past. Each study ends with a score presented in a variety of charting diagrams and a ranking list. Enter new lessons manually or import them (using a Google Drive template) as CSV files. Thanks to the Dropbox integration you can share all your lessons on diffferent devices or with friends. You can also send lessons via mail to other users/devices.If you donât want to create your own lessons, use a large number of ready-made lessons in many foreign languages (see below).Function summary- Vocabulary trainer for many languages- Create your own lessons- Import lessons from CSV-files- Enter as many answers per question as you want- Add explanations or example sentences for each question and each answer- Use many different ways of training with writing exercises, verbally exercises or multiple-choice-exercises- Further improve your skills by using the homescreen widget to remember unknown words each time you look at your homescreen- Listen to questions and answers (Text-To-Speech)- Learn more efficiently with the help of  mixed lessons containing only questions you do not know well- Display your learning progress graphically and in rankings- Search and query for unknown or wrongly translated terms- Sort your lessons by date of last study or by study result (score)- Use the fully integrated online dictionary Leo to search for additional translations- Share your lessons using Dropbox or mailProfessor-Drill comes with these âready-to-useâ vocabulary lessons:- Vocabulary trainer English-German (about 2.800 words)- Vocabulary trainer English-Italian (about 1.700 words)  - Vocabulary trainer English-Spanish (about 1.600 words)- Vocabulary trainer English-French (about 2.400 words)",
