It would be great if an icon could be added to each of your friends in the friends menu to let you know that they are or are not ready to be held again. Instead of having to go throughout the entire list only to find a few ready to be helped. I know that once the collect the tax your notified but if you help multiple friends at once it\\'s impossible to remember each one to help them again.",
