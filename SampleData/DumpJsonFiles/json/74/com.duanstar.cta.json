        "title": "Good for what it does",
        "comment": "A quick look shows it to be functional, and the implementation of the search box is a big plus for a massive agency like CTA.  I see some reviews commenting on accuracy of prediction times, but that is a function of the underlying server, not the app.  The app gets a prediction, it displays it, after possibly massaging it for prediction age.  Find nearby stops is interesting, because an app dealing with this type of server has no foreknowledge of stop location without contacting the server, and to my knowledge, that server has no \\\"search by location\\\" feature, so this involves some innovative programming.  How do I know this?  I wrote jata, just another transit app, so I can get predictions in Worcester MA.  Because Worcester uses a Clever Devices server, it also works with Chicago. Oh! and there was a complaint about \\\"Transaction limit for current day has been exceeded.\\\"  This is a result of some arbitrary limit set up by CTA and / or Clever Devices.  It supposedly can be resolved by issuing a larger quota, but the requirements for this are not published anywhere.",
