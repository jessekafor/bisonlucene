Our free cloud service that also works with this app and pricing for the paid cloud service have not changed. This pricing change was necessary to assure that we can continue to support our customers with the best possible products. After nearly three years of free service and two years of development time into our latest suite of products, it was clear that we could not continue with a completely free version of this app. Although our large user base is a complement to our products, it also generates a significant load on our services, which are costly to maintain. Keeping quality as the foremost goal, we decided to not introduce advertisements in our applications and instead introduce a straight-forward, simple, and reasonably priced subscription plan.",
