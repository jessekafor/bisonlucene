    "description": "Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains mind or promote a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or as an end in itself. The term meditation includes many techniques designed to promote relaxation, build internal energy or life force and develop compassion, love, patience, generosity and forgiveness. Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind, chill after stressful situation and ease many health issues, such as high blood pressure, depression or anxiety. There are three main criteria essential to meditation practices: use of a determined technique, logic relaxation, and a self-induced mode.  Mantras help to reach the relaxation and self-induced mode. The most common mantra is Om. To attain single-pointedness of mind constant repetition of mantras during meditation session is very important.
