    "description": "Avare (pronounced \"Av Air\") is a free moving-map aviation GPS app. Note: Internet access is required only for installing the app, an aviation database, and at least 1 chart; then to update METAR/TAF, & TFR graphics & Text.Avare provides offline moving map on all FAA charts (VFR Sectional, IFR lo/hi enroute, Approach Plate, WAC & TAC); plus A/FD info, Airport Diagrams w/GPS Taxi, and Terminal Procedures. Also included: GPS status, Terrain/Elevation Maps, 50 Nearest airports, Obstacles, and more.  Some FAA Charts cover Puerto Rico, plus parts of Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Canadian topo moving maps and unofficial airport info are also now available and volunteers may add other countries. All of this is Completely Free with no ads! Optional donation requested to support chart server & continued development.Notice: Avare is not FAA certified.Avare Advantages:â¢Made by & for pilotsâ¢Easy to learn & useâ¢Quick & responsiveâ¢Runs on most Android devicesâ¢Free App & materialsâ¢No adsâ¢No invasive permissionsMore Features:â¢Long-press any airport on chart or type in code to set as Destination.â¢GPS ground track bearing, speed and altitude.â¢GPS distance, track line, and Time to any airport.â¢Nearest Airports (with wx color code), touch to select.â¢Basic flight leg planning.â¢Runway extension option on Destination.â¢Type in any address or coordinates and set as Destination.â¢METAR & TAF: long-press airport on chart (Internet required).â¢TFRs: Graphical TFRs and text (Internet required).â¢Terrain: USGS terrain maps.â¢Obstacles: Any over 500' AGL within 200' of GPS altitude displayed.â¢Frequencies, runways, fuel availability, & other A/FD info.â¢Landscape or Portrait display Preference, North Up or Track Up (NU/TU).â¢Draw notes directly on-screen, or Pan freely around charts (Draw/Pan).â¢Touch any two points on chart for approximate distance between them.â¢Location icon can be centered or placed anywhere on screen.â¢GPS compass direction, Bearing, and Distance to and FROM any point on the map by long-pressing one finger on that point. Great for your ATC and CTAF radio calls.Avare installation begins with the small app, which then requires an internet connection to fetch an aviation Database and at least one chart. You can then choose additional charts and materials for Avare to Download free at any time. Note: The FAA occasionally changes their charts such that outdated charts may incorrectly display your location in Avare, so be sure to Update any charts you may use in flight! We also recommend that ANY time you plan to Update a chart, you first ensure you have the latest version of Avare and its Database.Avare works on any device running Android 2.2 and newer. Note: Please see our apps4av.com website (you can use our Developer link here) for Manual Install instructions if you're unable to install here on the Play store.In addition to a Nexus 7 and other recent model devices, we test new releases on a first-gen phone running Android 2.2. The fact that Avare is designed to run fine on a minimal early phone means that on newer devices itâs even more responsive and easier to use. An inexpensive external GPS will improve reliability and accuracy (including WAAS) on most devices, and some users prefer the larger screen area of a tablet device. With a 4â³ or larger screen Avare is much easier to use and read than a paper chart, or than many 4\" screen expensive FAA certified GPS devices.After installing Avare, please use the Help feature to begin. New features are being added very quickly in response to user feedback and requests, so our website sometimes lags behind our innovation. You can Contact us directly via our apps4av site to share your questions, feedback, and feature requests.Launch Note: Press the square Options button at the bottom left of the screen for Help.",

Two things that bother me: When creating a flight plan with multiple airports it would be nice to be able to view the approach plates at the intermediate airports. For the drawing feature, it is nearly impossible to use it to write down AWOS/ATC information - after drawing something, lifting the pen and touching the screen again a short distance away, an unwanted line segment is drawn, making it impossible to write closely spaced letters and numbers.",
