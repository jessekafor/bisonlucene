        "comment": "Sometimes this works exactly as expected, which is great. Other times, it\\'s annoying, like right now, when my phone has been out if the dock for 10 minutes, and the volume is still high while I\\'m at work, when I want it to be silent.  I wanted to support another developer instead of 244, but this is making my decision regrettable.",
