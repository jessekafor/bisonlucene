    "description": "Season Zen HD is an Editor's Choice on Google Play!Season Zen allows you to enjoy Spring in a peaceful Sakura park surrounded by the blossoming of new life in this beautiful Live Wallpaper.  Perfect for every season, and especially Easter!Bring your phone to life with this serene 3D Spring wallpaper.Sunlight filters through swaying trees in a peaceful park, as cherry blossoms float past. A birds nest perched in a branch overlooks a park bench, gently flowing brook, and blooming flowers.If you prefer to try other seasons, a Summer, Autumn / Fall, and Winter theme is available in the full version. You can match your season just by changing the theme - it's like getting four wallpapers for the price of one.In the full version, you can also customize nearly every part of the scene, including the bench, leaves, snow, flowers, eggs, stream, and more - thousands of possible combinations! Even choose from Easter egg patterns. An animated butterfly will fly through the scene. You can also hide or show the nest, eggs, butterfly, river, and more.Works great with phones, tablets, Tegra HD devices, or any device that supports live wallpapers.Problems?  Just email our support team with a description of the problem.",
