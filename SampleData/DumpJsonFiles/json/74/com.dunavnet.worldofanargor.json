The coin drop rate for the potions you\\'ll need is a joke, there\\'s no health/mana regen over time, and in the end, you\\'ll need to use the IAP to progress. I play things like this all the time, and so far this game\\'s a joke. You want a better game? Check out Ravensword: Shadowlands and the prequels. Devs, polish this game and I might reinstall. Good day.",

        "comment": "Well, here is Anagor again with the same quality graphics and thats it.  An extra star was earned because the game is not crashing and freezing the phone.  Some enjoyment can be found, but the UI is still cumbersome,  the combat is aweful, and the overall gameplay is boring. This is a really difficult genre for game development and the effort is noticeable, at least with the graphics. Also, when the game is completely stopped, the game continues to run in the background.  Not good team. Thanks.",

Awful user interface with an unreadable gothic font chaser, terrible camera control constantly obscured by foreground foliage, arduous and apparently pointless archery, and instead of health/mana regeneration you pay in realtime for potions which you then have to \\\"equip\\\" (sigh). Gear is bought via a store which you apparently carry in your pocket, and no selling.",
