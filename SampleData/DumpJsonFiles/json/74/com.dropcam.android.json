        "comment": "The software is great but there are two annoying bugs. When I go to a cameras events sometimes the audio of the camera will start playing. I have to go back to the live video and then again to events to fix stop the audio playback. The other bug is when in scrolling through events it suddenly kicks me out back to the video like I lose the authenticated session and the only way to fix this is to go all the way back to the camera list. I always lose my place in the events list :(",
