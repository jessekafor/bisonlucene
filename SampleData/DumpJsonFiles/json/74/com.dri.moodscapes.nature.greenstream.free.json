        "comment": "The stream is too fast. I don\\'t really find it relaxing. Somewhat static other than the water. Otherwise, I suppose it is indeed green. The download is very large, but I suppose that is to get around bandwidth streaming issues. Would I pay 99c for this video? Don\\'t think so as I could easily play content from YouTube on my GTV.",
