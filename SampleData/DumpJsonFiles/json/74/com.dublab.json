        "comment": "Really. But as of right now I see no reason to use it over TuneIn Pro. In TuneIn I can actually see the title of the show playing and I can control the buffer amount to prevent skipping.  What I do like about the dublap app so far is the UI and the sweet animations. Work-in show information (you say it\\'s integrated, but I don\\'t see it anywhere), a view of the event schedule and maybe a tap for the mp3 blog - and then you\\'d be golden. Heck, I\\'d pay for the app then.   Keep it up :D",
