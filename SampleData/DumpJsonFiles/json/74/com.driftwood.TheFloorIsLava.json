    "description": "The Floor is Lava is a fun, fast-paced, puzzle game where the goal is to clear levels by causing floor tiles to fall into the lava below. Attractive 3D graphics, challenging game play, and a truly incredible soundtrack really set this game apart.\"I used to get lost in the local supermarket, but since I've been playing 'The Floor is Lava', I can navigate the aisles perfectly and at great speed!\" - Happy supermarketeer.\"There is nothing quite like the Zen of 'The Floor is Lava'. Through careful meditation and yoga, I can almost reach the same happy warm place that 'The Floor is Lava' brings me every game.\" - Yoga practitioner.\"Daddy, you should make dinosaur bones fall on the dinosaur bone level instead of gems.\" - Play testerOnline leader boards, achievements, and ever-changing themed levels keep 'The Floor is Lava' fresh long after the flaming molten rock pile has mercilessly consumed you in your first game. Its the most fun you can have without jumping on the furniture!Can you beat my (arguably impenetrable) high score?",
