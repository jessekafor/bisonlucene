The controls aren\\'t too bad, i think if you spaced the arrows farther apart it would be better, and if you make this where you can use the xperia gamepad than that would be really neat. Overall the game isn\\'t bad, but if you had multiplayer it would be better, and fixed minor problems. But I would recommend that people give this game a try.",
