        "comment": "Type 1, basal and bolus shots.  Lets me track at home on the Kindle Fire and at work (or on the go) on the web.  Gives weekly reports. After a few weeks I started to spot trends in my BG readings vs time of day. If I forget to measure (or enter a measurement) I get a text message reminding me.  That can be turned off, but I like it at the moment.  This doesn\\'t do diet calculations, so you still need to work out how many carbs and protein that steak and salad amount to and then work up your bolus manually.  I hope to see something like the USDA food database integrated in a future release.  Nothing out there is perfect, but this is easy to use and that alone is a powerful incentive to tracking BG better.",

        "comment": "This is one of the best designed diabetes apps and is very clever in how it looks and works the same on all devices. However twice in the last week I have received 404 errors when trying to access the app...this is not acceptable for something which is meant to help monitor diabetes. Have abandoned this and will be trying debees instead.",
