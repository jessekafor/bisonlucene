        "comment": "Its fun to play till you find out when you get the coins you need for power ups, it takes your coins and doesnt give you the power up.  Then wants even more coins for the same power up that you earned and didnt get.   You work hard to accumulate it again, thinking it was a fluke........ and the same things happens again.  It just seems they are determined to wring money out of you, and have no intention of giving you the rewards they said you would get from trying to play a good game.....",

You earn money by catching fish, but each shot costs you money, so you need to make sure your shots are profitable. you can rarely make a profit and when you do its only 1 or 2 coins, and upgrades cost 1000s. The upgrades don\\'t seen to make a difference either. Has potential but too hard and monotonous.",
