    "description": "This is a network unlocker for ZTE Blade and Orange San Francisco Android phones. The app generates codes to network unlock your phone so that you are not tied to a specific network provider. e.g. instead of only being allowed to use Orange SIMs, you can instead use T-Mobile SIMs.Please note that the code generated from this app is only for the ZTE Blade and Orange San Francisco phones. To network unlock your phone, insert a SIM card from a different network and enter the network code when prompted.This app automatically fetches the IMEI number from your phone. To generate a code for a different phone, you must enter the IMEI number of the phone to be unlocked.Note: there are reports that newer versions of this phone have an updated algorithm. If you have problems getting the unlock to work, click on 'support' in the menu to get further information.Internet access required for AdMob adverts (not shown in the Pro/Donate version).",
