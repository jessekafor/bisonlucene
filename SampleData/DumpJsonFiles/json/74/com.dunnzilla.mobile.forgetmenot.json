It will gently remind you once every so many days to call or text the people you choose to remember.It also monitors the numbers of outbound calls, so that if you initiate a call outside of the app, it still knows you called someone you said you would.Permissions?  Here's why it needs what it does:READ_CONTACT: To let you pick a contact.CALL_PHONE: To place a call.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS: To update a Reminder that you have called someone even if you did not initiate the call using this app.INTERNET: For future use, to get status updates and tips of the day.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: To start the service upon bootup.GET_TASKS: To determine if the Forget Me Not service is currently running.",
