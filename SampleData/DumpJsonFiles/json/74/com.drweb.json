I hate having to try to stop the active parts of the app at same time trying to force stop it to finally get it to stop. In the old version it was nice to run it only when installing new apps then force stopping it to keep phone speed up. Going to uninstall new version and return to old. Long as the updates work you get to keep 4 stars :)",
