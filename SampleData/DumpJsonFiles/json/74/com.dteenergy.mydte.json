We ask for these permissions so that we can provide you with the following useful features:Your Accounts, Find Account on Device, Read Google Service Configuration, Sync Settings, Read Sync Settings allows us to sync to Google Drive to save addresses.  This makes entering outages easier for you. You can choose opt out of this feature later.Your Location, Storage and Test Access to Protected Storage helps find your location on the outage map and enables Google maps. We also store your address on your device so that you can see your stored locations within the app.Camera allows you to use the flash of your camera as a flashlight to help you during a power outage. We do not access any of your pictures or your actual camera. We do not record images or video.Control Vibration and Prevent Device From Sleeping allows us to send you notifications. You can choose to opt out of this feature later, but you must initially grant permission for access to the Outage Center.",

I have to question whether DTE consumes the outage information because they do not send out notifications you request, or status updates to the app. I always call as well as a backup.  Also, between three different users, we\\'re not sure what the different color zones in the outage maps mean. We\\'re assuming the dark-purple zones indicate an outage? I\\'ve also seen green and I think yellow zones. A legend would be useful.",
