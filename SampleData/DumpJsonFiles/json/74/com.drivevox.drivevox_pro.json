I confess I am always tempted to check my emails when I'm driving and I almost had an accident 2 weeks ago because of that. Since I installed Text'nDrive App, no more typing while driving... a nice lady voice reads me emails directly on my Bluetooth handset and I can focus on the road without having to touch my phone. I will probably upgrade to the pro version to be able to reply to my emails with my voice. GREAT APP! I highly recomment it for anyone who does not have it yet.\" - Claire Rodriguez \"I was a bit skeptical at first but this app works out well. Will give it a few more runs but I think I'll upgrade to the pro version soon. Very satisfied.\" - Carl Devine Text'nDrive supports all Yahoo accounts with POP access including ymail and Yahoo Plus, and most regular Yahoo email accounts.

Text n drive when purchased when  you get a message it reads out loud and when you want to reply it sends as voice message and does not work properly. When you send a text it does not send as a written text only voice so keep in mind and makes your phone crash and act up. Horrible app do not download.",
