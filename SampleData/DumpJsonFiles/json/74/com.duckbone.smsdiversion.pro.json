        "comment": "Nice little app that lets me leave my personal phone in my car/home and never again drop my personal $400 phone while on the job. The ability to turn it off/on remotely is cool.   To be WAY COOL, 5+ stars - Currently messages arrive as forwarded messages and replies just go back to your phone and bounce back. To send to original sender, you have to create a new message. Sort of negates conversational text. I\\'d like to be able to reply directly to sender and better yet, the option of passing it through my personal phone since many won\\'t recognize my work number.   AND, a forwarded message should be marked as read, so it stops reminding me. In my case, it shows as an unanswered text and dings reminders all day, sucking the battery down. Yea, I know I can turn this off, but it\\'s one more thing I have to do every morning after forwarding the phone calls, then activating Diversion Pro.",
