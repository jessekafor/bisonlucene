    "description": "FREE app. Blocks all incoming calls. Puts an auto-reply to all texts coming in. Texting & Driving Prevention Application from AutoInsuranceEZ.com is an Android app that you can download for free. While in use, the app silences text messages and incoming calls and sends the caller a text letting them know that youâre on the road. This app helps keep our roads safe by promoting the idea of no texting while driving. Texting while driving is a habit deadlier than drunk driving, and is a serious problem, especially among teenagers. A texting driver is 23 times more likely to get into an accident than a non-texting driver.  To stop this dangerous behavior, the AutoInsurance EZ.com team created a Texting and Driving Prevention app. The app features: Start Trip/End Trip - Once you turn it on, if you receive a text message or call, it will send a bounce back message to the sender. You can customize the message. Speed limit â The app blocks all incoming calls and messages when the GPS shows the phone moving over a certain speed. You can specify the speed limit in the settings.Texting and Driving Prevention application from AutoInsuranceEZ.com is the most effective app for parents worried about their teen drivers.Like our style?
