It was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007. The statue represents Jesus standing with outstretched, welcoming arms and is one of the most famous symbols of this lively city. It sits on top of Corcovado Mountain and is located in Tijuca National Park. It has been admired and visited by millions of people since it was first built in 1931. The Cristo Redentor figure vies with Sugarloaf Mountain as the emblem of the city. Its site offers a view over Rio de Janeiro that is even more spectacular than Sugarloaf's.The largest art deco statue in the world, it is 130 ft (39 m) tall and the arms measure 98 ft (30 m) across. Made of reinforced concrete and sandstone it was unveiled in 1931.On a clear day the views from the base of it are fantastic. At night the statue is lit up and seemingly hovers over the city as the mountain it stands on is dark. If it is cloudy the clouds light up and the effect can be quite spectacular and ethereal. In the evening, powerful spotlights illuminate it, making it glow and appear almost to levitate above the darkened peak. By day or night, no matter where you may go in the city of Rio, Cristo Redentor has the presence of an icon. It represents a worldwide symbol for peace.
