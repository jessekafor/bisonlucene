    "description": "\"Moe Moe Block8\" is a kind of \"Breakout\" game which is bouncing a ball and destroying clothes(like block) on girl.When energy gauge is charged on 100%, you can attack blocks by laser in this version!A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side blocks. When a block is hit, the ball bounces away and the block is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.You get some points by playing game, and you can play new stage by using the points.If you want to play new stage as soon as possible, you should take advantage of shopping wisely!There are some items which take advantage to the game.-add extra ball-make the ball penetrate the block-make paddle larger-make paddle smaller-make the barrier behind the paddle-make the ball blinking-speed up the ball-speed down the ball-make clothes semi transparency-zoom up the girlWhen you destroy all blocks, you see a clear graphic of girl behind the blocks.This game has international and domestic ranking. Can you put your name on the leaderboard also?",
