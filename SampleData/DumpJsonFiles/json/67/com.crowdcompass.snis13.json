    "description": "The upcoming 3rd SNIS International Endovascular Stroke Conference (IESC) and Joint Cerebrovascular Section Annual Meeting, scheduled for February 4-5, 2013 at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii. Replacing the 2013 SNIS Practicum, the IESC, in a first-time initiative, will be co-hosted in partnership with the Joint Cerebrovascular Section Annual Meeting immediately prior to the International Stroke Conference. There are many benefits to such an initiative, but certainly one of the most compelling is that this strategic alignment provides both organizations the opportunity to offer a consolidated stroke program that represents the most comprehensive program for practitioners of neurointerventional stroke treatment today.Keywords: neurointerventional, neurosurgery, stroke, interventional, neurointerventional",
