    "description": "No root required!This app will install Debian or Ubuntu onto your device.You will need a mouse or stylus to use it.Contains bugs! If you need stable desktop environment for everyday use - you'd better search for another Linux installer, there are several such apps on Google Play, all of them require rooted device.GIMP image editor, or office suite pre-installed (AbiWord and Gnumeric, there's no PowerPoint support).You will need 200 Mb free on internal data storage, plus 500 Mb on SD card.This app is NOT full Ubuntu OS - it is a compatibility layer, which allows you to run Ubuntu applications.Your phone is NOT rooted during installation. This is NOT official Ubuntu.com release.There are several limitations:- It cannot mess up your Android device. It is a plain regular Android app, so you can close or kill it when you desire.- Desktop environment is somewhat broken.- Video output is slow. This can be improved by creating native Android X.org server (Xsdl is a good place to start).- No audio support. Maybe it will be added in the future, however it will lag a lot, and there's no way to fix the lag.- No hardware mouse support. Probably it will be added in the future.- No OpenGL support. It's possible to add it but it's a huge chunk of work, and I will not be doing that.- No access to the device hardware. That means you cannot re-partition SD card, you cannot burn CD-Roms, you cannot run ping or sniff your network etc.- No camera support. It's possible to add, however not worth the effort, since Ubuntu can access photos on your SD card.- No multitouch support - this is a limitation of Ubuntu itself.- No ability to move app to SD card.- No pseudo-terminal support, so XTerm and many utilities do not work.Sources available on developer site.",

The Samsung Galaxy Note II uses the S-Pen which draws a cursor on the screen when it\\'s 1cm above the screen, so I think this should be another input method. When hovering it moves the mouse cursor, when clicking it clicks, also the pen has a button (I don\\'t know if the app can detect the button) which could be used for right click or as scroll wheel.",
