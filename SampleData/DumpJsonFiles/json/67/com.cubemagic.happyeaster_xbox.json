    "description": "Easter eggs are special eggs that are often given to celebrate Easter or springtime. The oldest tradition is to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as jelly beans. These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, who may be told they were left by the Easter Bunny. They also may be put in a basket filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a bird's nest. We made a 3D cube Live Wallpaper for this Easter celebration. We are the Easter Bunny.
