        "comment": "I love that this has been released ahead of the conference and seems to be complete with all of the tools that we\\'ll use at the conference. My only negative is that the 2 floor plan maps \\\"DEF Area Map\\\" and \\\"Convention Center\\\" show up to small and I\\'m only provided with one zoom in. The zoomed in version still doesn\\'t fill 1/4 of my screen. (Galaxy S4)",
