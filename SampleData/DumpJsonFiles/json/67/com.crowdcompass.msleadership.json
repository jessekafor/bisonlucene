    "description": "Each November at the Society Leadership Conference, leaders across the MS movement gather together to celebrate progress, learn from each other, and strengthen commitments to make an even greater impact in the coming year. Participation in this important annual gathering is growing â not just in-person â but around the country through live video and digitally-shared content. It reflects our collective strength and determination to achieve a world free of MS. This yearâs theme: A Shared Promise, reminds us that our promise to people living with MS depends on our commitment to a shared vision, and the continued leadership development and progress necessary to deliver on the promise. Each of us are leaders in the MS movement, and as individuals our contributions are many. Together, weâre keeping A Shared Promise.KEYWORDS:ms, society, mssociety, leadership, conference, November, Dallas, MSpromise, shared, promise, a shared promise, everyday matters, walk ms, bike ms, challenge walk",
