    "description": "Dear friends! We offer a unique game product - \"Happy Pet!\"In this game you will be able to fully realize yourselves as a good pet owner. First, select a pet and give it a name. After this the game will start. From time to time the pet will require you to do a certain action, such as to feed it or clean after it. In no case, do not ignore its requests, as this depends on the rate of  the development of your pet. If it is hungry -  feed it, if it is bored - play with it. Don't just leave your pet unattended, and then it will reward you fully for your efforts.\"Happy Pet for Android is a very interesting and lovely pet virtual game - AppEggs.com\"The game is based on the principle of the classic Tamagotchi (ãã¾ãã£ã¡ tamagotti).",

This is where More INTERACTION with our Pets would come in..This is the only thing I can really say I have any problem with...Other than this I got NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER...",

A real pet owner can play with their pets whenever and can switch back and forth through things they buy it.. it is two stars cause my son likes seeing the dog or I would delete it. I still might and find him one that\\'s more interactive.",

It\\'s cute just a tad boring when everything is full and you can\\'t do anything else with the pet.",

Also, it takes WAY too long for my pet to catch up on his sleep; and no matter what I do, he never gets a liveliness of 10. Would be 5 stars if those two issues weren\\'t so incredibly frustrating!! Oh, and we should most definitely be able to EARN crystals.",
