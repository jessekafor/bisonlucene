Sean Brakefield\\'s app\\'s that you blatantly infringed upon, have been around forever and just keep getting better by each update, while this poorly constructed clone just popped up recently.  It\\'s incredibly apparent that this charlatan or developer if you so choose, has absolutely downloaded and used Sean\\'s app\\'s Infinite Painter and Infinite Design.  And this developer must have said to himself \\\"Gee, I\\'m horribly unoriginal, untalented, and uncreative, I know! I\\'ll design a drawing app, and I\\'ll copy everything out of that drawing app, Infinite Painter!  Yeah, it\\'s infringing upon Sean\\'s intellectual property, but, well I don\\'t have morals or scruples or ethics, so what the heck, I just want to make a quick buck while stealing someone else\\'s ideas and hard work!\\\"  The only \\\"Serious\\\" thing about this app, is the Serious scumbaggery of ripping off another developers idea\\'s!",
