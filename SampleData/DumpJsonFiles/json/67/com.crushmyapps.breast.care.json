    "description": "Having saggy breast is very common, especially in women who have large breasts and who are aged. Adding to the problem, hormonal changes - both during pregnancy and as you reach menopause - make breasts sag even more. You can choose to carry out a plastic surgery. Apart from surgery, you can lift your breast up in a natural way. The best strategy to prevent sagging is to wear supportive sports bras that have good upward support and hold the breasts close to the chest. Strength exercises that target the pectoral muscles may provide some benefit in elevating overlying breast tissue. Push-ups, dumb-bell flies and weight machines that work the pectoral muscles may provide some aesthetic benefit. De-emphasize your focus on weight and continue regular exercise and healthy eating habits.",
