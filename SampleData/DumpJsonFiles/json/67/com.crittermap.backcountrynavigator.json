Still looking for the cool topo  option that visible on its logo.  Waypoints are easy to create and modify. Still waiting to try out the tracking option.",

        "comment": "So, here is what I did. With \\\"Keep GPS ON\\\" enabled the app was consuming a lot more battery than Google maps. So I said to myself to try it with \\\"Keep GPS ON\\\" disabled. It did seem to consume less battery. Then I came at home, turned off the GPS, charged the phone fully, then watched a movie during which I did not used the phone at all (so the phone was in standby for 2 hours). After the movie, I checked the phone (Nexus 4) and the battery was at 50%!! Looking at battery stats for the 2 hours of standby, BackCountry Nav was accounting for 68% of battery consumption and the rest was the android system, probably because of BackCountry Nav calls to system services. Just for info, my phone is very efficient in standby without this app (it only discharges a few percents over a whole night). Needless to say that if this app kills the battery, then it does not matter AT ALL ANYMORE what features it has!",
