    "description": "Downloadable geo-referenced (moving map) aviation charts for the CONTIGUOUS 48 United States: Sectional, WAC, Enroute Low, Terminal Area; also includes non-geo-referenced VFR flyways charts.  Simple course lines are supported along with display of various data such as GPS latitude, longitude, speed, altitude, bearing, etc.OpenFlightGPS (then released in 2010 as \"OpenFlight Map\") was the FIRST Android Aviation Charting App available.  I created this app because there were no Android chart options at the time; and continue to service the app with FAA charts as provided on the FAA \"aeronav\" web site.  The charts are provided in their entirety, and as such are clearly marked with their effective dates and all other margin information.  You must download the charts one at a time as this app is provided to you at my personal expense and as such I would rather not have folks downloading 10 gigs at a pop from my website for charts they probably won't look at.This application is absolutely free and free of any advertising or other garbage*.  If OpenFlightGPS doesn't work for you or you don't like it for any reason, delete it.  If you're nice, I might respond to emailed suggestions.  Bad ranking in general will not get any result, and you'll just prove what kind of entitled person (or maybe representative of one of the paid vendors ...) you are.Works best on 10\" tablets, also works with 7\" and other form factor tablets and most cell phones - but many cell phones do not have good GPS reception without \"cell tower\" assist.The complete set is about 150 charts - note that the application may initialize more slowly if a very large number of charts is cached.  Add to or change your set of charts at any time via WIFI download from within the app.  Geo-referenced, moving map technology including access to all (1) Sectional (VFR), (2) World Aeronautical (WAC), (3) Enroute Low (IFR) and (4) Terminal Area (TAC) Charts for the contiguous 48 United States.  Also includes non-Geo-Referenced Fly Way Charts.  Individual charts are downloaded on demand through the app; individual chart files are between 2 and 10 megabytes, so WIFI works best when caching maps.When moving, \"GPS Mode\" shows graphic (miniature airplane with pointer) pointing in direction of movement.  When stopped, graphic changes to a house icon.  \"Compass Mode\" shows the direction ON THE MAP that the device is pointed.  Also shows current latitude, longitude and altitude and current map scale.To the guy from one of the hardware vendors that writes in the comments of all the free/low cost aviation charting apps about \"wanting someone you can sue if there's a problem ... blah blah ... skin in the game\" : The license terms you agreed to specifically disallow using this application in flight, or for any Aeronautical Decision Making whatsoever.  I do appreciate that you are touched by this free application, as the primary reason I am giving it away is that I am sick and tired of overpriced map updates for most of the paid (and all of the certified) products  ...  Foreflight is an exception, and is reasonably priced ... if you don't want plates, anyway.  Too bad they don't sell it on an open platform.As per the license terms installing and using this application affirms that you agree that \"Roger B. Leuthner is not responsible in any way for your use of this program in any respect\", which you must agree to when activating the application on your device.OpenFlight is a trademarked name, and is not part of the OpenFlightGPS application.*Google is in the business of gathering and selling information about you.  Supporting Google by increasing the Android ecosystem with this free application is a necessary by-product of providing easy access to General Aviation pilots.",
