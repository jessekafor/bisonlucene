        "comment": "The games  here are varied and do work out your memory. The problem now is that I am able to memorize all the icons and words in the Imprinting game. This would be 5* if the Imprinting game had more words and if there were either more icons or if the icons were randomly drawn every week or so.",

        "comment": "\\\"Back\\\" closes the app. The dialog \\\"End?\\\" is needed. Long start of the app - why I should see that logo every time? I just need get fast to the  tests and not to leave app accidentally. This does apply to all vendor\\'s apps. Why they all have not working  links to  apps that say \\\"soon\\\" when few of them are allready on the market?",
