        "comment": "I have been using BackCountry Navigator for several months on a Samsung SGH-T959D. The application is Excellent and Canadian maps are as good as they were on my previous GPS device. Play with BCN for an hour or two and it becomes easy to use. There is some delay in establishing an initial GPS fix on the Samsung that has not totally been solved but I don\\'t think that is the fault of BCN as it has been reported by others using other mapping applications. I highly recommend this application.  After another year has gone by I can say that Nathan, the developer, really has the best interests of his users at heart.    BCN is evolving nicely and Nathan maintains contact with purchasers, sending tips and offering explanations why things work the way they do (provided the user subscribes).  I have replaced my Samsung with a Google Nexus 4 and have noticed much better GPS response.",

        "comment": "I recently carted my DroidX around the White Clouds of Idaho and Backcountry Navigator kindof sucks.  Problem 1 - No offline help. None. Nadda. Zip. So you better have memorized everything before you head into the backcountry because backcountry navigator pro only has ONLINE help.  Problem 2 - Code design problem. The app uses SQLite, which is fine. Database is in App data space and your maps are on the SD card space. If you clear data on the App because it is acting wonky, you lose the database. The App code doesn\\'t know either how to write out the database or rebuild itself. So you are basically hosed. This is a really, really fundamental code boo-boo.  Problem 3 - Code design problem. If you can\\'t get a GPS fix after a couple minutes, what should you do? Keep running until the battery dies? Or alert the user? If the software interface to the GPS service is hung, what should you do? Keep wasting battery or alert the user? BCN isn\\'t smart enough to alert the user. Instead it simply runs the battery dead. Very, very poor design for offline use.  Is Backcountry navigator worth the hype? Nope. It\\'s not ready for serious offline use. And why do I see AdWhirl when I paid $10?",

Once this occurs there is nothing that can be done to view where I am or to navigate to waypoints.  I suspect there is an underlying database reliability bug that is in the software or a library it uses. I give it 2 stars because it did guide me to find a backcountry lake with no trail, but failed on the return and fortunately I had a paper map and compass.  If the bug was fixed this is a 5 star app.",
