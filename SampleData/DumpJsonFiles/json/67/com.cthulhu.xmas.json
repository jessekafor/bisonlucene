    "description": "\"Red Wasp has produced perhaps the most interesting iPad advent calendar ever.\" - DigitallyDownloaded.net 'App of the Week' - nineoverten.com\"The artwork really does stand out and would make even Cthulhu proud. It is a nice gift to be presented with the vibrant and high-quality art each day. I loved how well Red Wasp Design was able to merge a holiday theme with the likes of Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep.\" - vividgamer.comThe Cthulhu Christmas Calendar is an advent app that counts down to Christmas but with a Cyclopean twist!  Each day features an original image which is unlocked in the December count down to Christmas.  The original artwork does indeed feature well-loved festive imagery you might expect such as Santa, mistletoe, Christmas trees and the like but these have been merged, mutated, mixed and mashed with other, darker figures drawn from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  Cthulhu Christmas Calendar is the fun way to count down till the stars are right and presents can be opened from their slumber.  As well as great art, each day also has a Cthulhu-related question for you to puzzle over and answer, with the finally tally of right and wrong being delivered on the 25th, when the score will give you your 'Mythos rating'.  Keep track of the sleeps until Cthulhu-mass with the Cthulhu Christmas Calendar; don't leave R'lyeh without it!",
