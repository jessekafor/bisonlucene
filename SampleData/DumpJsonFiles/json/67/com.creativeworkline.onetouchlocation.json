        "comment": "I liked the app until I bought the Pro license. All it enabled me to do was put in my name, email address, gave me an access code (which I don\\'t know where or how to use) and the ability to change the tracking interval from 10 mins, to a number of other choices. Nearly $3 for enabling 2 textboxes and 1 drop down is not worth it.  Go for the free version. I\\'m asking for my money back!  The free version gets a 4, but for $3 and 3 additional options, it just lost 3 stars. 1-star for the Pro version.",

With this one, you can send the link to anyone you like, and they just click it and they\\'re watching your last checkpoint (I\\'m upgrading to Pro just for the 5 minute update and the 24hr history). Other apps\\' waypoint trail only lasts for 10 minutes so OneTouch is great. Props!",
