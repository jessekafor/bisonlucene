        "comment": "I really want this app to work so I can buy the paid version (I want to use it here in Boston). However, I won\\'t do so until they invest in making this app work on a Droid phone. It crashes or freezes constantly so I can\\'t even tell if it\\'s any good, but those who use it on the iPhone (which it was made for) say it is great. Right now this is the most useless app for a Droid user.",
