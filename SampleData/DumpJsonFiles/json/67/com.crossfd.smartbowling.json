        "comment": "This game is simple, and plain which isn\\'t bad considering its bowling However tho it seems very elementary it seems to have some major glitches. The biggest one being that pins that are clearly on their way down just maybe slower than other pins stand back up (usually being the difference between a strike or a spare) this is a highly inconvenient issue seeing as how I believe I have gotten the sure fire way to get a strike every time also levels don\\'t unlock after perfect game LAME!!",

        "comment": "As others have already stated, game play on this app is simply horrible.  Pins that CLEARLY went down, and which logically COULD NOT have stayed up, are placed back up by the game.  The opening screen is also very difficult to view because of the bright blue swirled background that makes it hard to see buttons and balls.  Then there\\'s the ads...  While others MIGHT appreciate Japanese language ads featuring half naked anime characters, I didn\\'t.  I will be reporting this to Google as I feel the content rating of this app needs adjusting if that sort of ad is going to be shown.  Oh, and don\\'t bother selecting what ball you want.  No matter which you pick the game will give you something else.",
