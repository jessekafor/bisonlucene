        "comment": "Originally reviewed as one star, but now up-rating after extended use.  The questions are varied and cover a good variety of situations from the everyday to the less common. Useful for testing your C# knowledge even if there is no interview in the pipe.   Still don\\'t like the prompt to accept notification-bar advertising, but declining does work and you can still use the app.",
