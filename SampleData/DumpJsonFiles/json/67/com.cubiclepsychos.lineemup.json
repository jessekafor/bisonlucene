    "description": "Line'em Up is a 2 player turn based board game. Its a traditional game played in the southern parts of India. You can find people playing it on boards drawn on sand, wooden boards or paper. Its a good game to sharpen concentration and focus. *How to playEach player gets 3 coins each of which are placed on the board in turns, one at a time at the beginning of the game.The player can place a coin at any of the positions indicated by the square boxes by tapping at the position desired. Once the 3 coins are placed on the board, a coin can be moved to another location by tapping the coin first and then the new location. The coin can be moved only to the adjacent locations as indicated by the squares which are seen on tapping the coin. The player who first lines up his coins in a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally wins the game.",
