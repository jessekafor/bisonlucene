The order is determined by the geometric shapes and colors of the cubes. The pieces slide horizontally and vertically, dragging along with each movement, the row of cube pieces.There are four levels of difficulty depending on the number of rows and columns of the matrix: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 and 6x6. This version only have 3x3 mode.At the end of the game, when the puzzle is completed, your time and number of movements is recorded in order to keep the best times.You can compete online with other players from all over the world and know what your position is in the ranking for each category. The shorter time and lesser movements it takes you to complete the puzzle, the higher your position in the World Ranking will be.",

        "comment": "Not a bad game, but the font is near impossible to read and there should be an option to remove the haptic feedback when moving the puzzle pieces. I\\'ll keep it since it was installed for free from appgratis, but it\\'s a little rough around the edges so I wouldn\\'t pay for it",
