        "comment": "Seven months after my last review, this joke of an app is no better than it was back then. Unless you want to watch two preselected VOD videos, watch three preselected live video streams, or listen to two preselected radio stations, there is absolutely nothing you can do. There\\'s a button to configure a playlist, but it appears to have no useful function at the current time... and that\\'s IT. There is still, seven months later, no way to listen to Octoshape streams on Android, and if they don\\'t get their act together soon, they\\'ll be made irrelevant when somebody else provides a better alternative. And in the meantime, we\\'re stuck with poor-quality streaming audio on Android. The only tiny silver lining is that iOS users seem to be in the same situation -- the same useless joke of an app is in the iTunes store too. Shame, because it works superbly for the preselected stations.",
