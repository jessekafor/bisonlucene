    "description": "Snow is a form of precipitation within the Earth's atmosphere in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes that fall from clouds. Since snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a granular material. It has an open and therefore soft structure, unless packed by external pressure. Snowflakes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. They are very beautiful as they form crystal structure and we made 3D live Wallpaper out of them. We added lighting effects to make them stunning. Features include:Options for transparent box2 different light sourceOption to move lightOption to change viewing angle and change background color.Option for Auto rotation with speed control, or manual control with finger swipe.",
