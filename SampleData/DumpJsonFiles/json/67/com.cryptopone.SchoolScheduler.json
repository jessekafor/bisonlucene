        "comment": "I reviewed many school schedulers, sat with my college daughter and rated eight applications.  This application is user friendly,  straight forward, efficient, synchronizes with your Google Calendar.  My wife said, why not bypass the scheduler and post to your calendar.  I replied,  you can isolate your school planning and add details at the task tab.  The developer listens to users.  The developer is adding a widget to the application with daily classes and tasks for quick access and visual people.",
