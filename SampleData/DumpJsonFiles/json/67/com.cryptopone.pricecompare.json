    "description": "Price Compare makes it easy to perform price comparisons and add new prices both at home and on the go.Use this app and find hidden deals during this time of price inflation. Is it really worth it to buy in bulk? Is that \"sale\" really a sale compared to the regular store you go to? These are just two examples of questions Price Compare helps answer.Once you've created products for the app to track, simply enter a price, amount and unit at the top of the screen (see screenshots) and compare unit prices instantly in the list view. Want to update a price to an existing product in the list? Just click on it and pick your store. That's it! You're done!Enter prices as you skim through flyers, walk down an aisle at a grocery store or while you go through your old receipts. All that info comes in handy the next time you see a supposed \"sale\" at the store.The items in the list view will colour code themselves according to the price entered at the top. Green means it's a deal! Red means you've found better prices previously.Full Version Features- Unlimited Categories- Unlimited Stores- Convert liquids and unitsFree Version Limitations (Purchase the unlock key to remove these restrictions):- Max 5 categories- Max 5 stores- Max 10 Products- Only mass amounts can be compared (mg, g, kg, oz, lb)Features:- By entering price, amount and mass/volume you can compare against previously entered prices instantly.

        "comment": "This simple app allows you to calculate & save unit prices by store & date, but with two maddening quirks. (1) On the summary page, the best and worst prices are shown without displaying their stores. This means you have to do some hunting to find out which store has te best price after enter all the data. (2) Every time you add a new item, every item on the summary page converts to the same unit (e.g., once you enter a price for bulk lunch meat, even liquid laundry detergent is displayed in pounds).",

Maybe they\\'re working on that, for now I don\\'t mind a few clicks and the time to get there. Also I want best/worst price to show which store that price is from.",
