        "comment": "I\\'m upping this to 3 stars.  It still needs a way to search authors and sessions, not to mention finding second authors on papers.  But today I found it surprisingly useful.  Needs a lot of work for next year, though.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:   I gave it the second star only because this is a first try.  The good news:  I didn\\'t have any trouble loading it, as others did.  The bad?  Well, let me count the ways:  There are 8400 papers at this meeting, which means 8000+ authors.  To find a given author, you have to scroll through every name.  Good luck looking for Zybenski.  There are sessions from A1 through Z47, Monday AM through Friday Noon.  Want to find P16? You\\'ve got a lot of scrolling to do.  No search function or keyboard input I could see.  And it\\'s a good thing I figured out that clicking the little ribbon would add a talk to my schedule, because there\\'s no help I could find, either.  No integration with my calendar, either, though I can download an .ics from the APS web site.  As I said, a first try.  I saw a sign about a feedback session, where we can suggest improvements.  If I can find it on the app, I\\'ll go. :-(",

I used the online schedule planner mostly but the internet at the conference is terrible and the webpage seem like it is overwhelmed.  it has been unavailable using my 3g network. If I had used this to favorite talks this may have been a great help.",
