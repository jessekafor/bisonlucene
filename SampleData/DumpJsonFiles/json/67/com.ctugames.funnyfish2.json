        "title": "Pretty decent game",
        "comment": "I bought this game because I really liked the artwork..  And I have to say the game play is pretty decent even if it\\'s more or less like a slot machine, or any kind of random based gambling device.     What ruins the experience for me is some of the horrid GUI elements, like the animated rotating cell phone, a simple animated red arrow would suffice and look much less out of place.    The game also tries to get you to install some kind of gaming-network app which you can thankfully decline.   And there are buttons for posting your fishes on facebook and adding friends from facebook, which makes the game feel a lot cheaper than it is.",
