Filled with hilarious animations, hundreds of sound effects, 1+Billion facts, hundreds of jokes, trivia, and advanced recording/playback effects, youâre guaranteed to be entertained! It's like Talking Tom Cat on steroids!ââ Installs to SD Card âââ 9 Ways to Have Fun ! â1) Talk / speak / text and ask Izar questions (carry on full conversations) and hear its fully adjustable funny voice talk back to you.2) Interact with Izar (touch, squeeze, swipe, hit, poke, punch, twirl, shake)3) Record and play your voice & music BACKWARDS & send the clips to your friends4) Record, morph, and play your voice with full pitch adjustment5) Sing & record your voice with full pitch correction adjustments (autotune effect!)6) Sing & record a duet with Izar in full harmony!7) Have Izar dance on screen to a random song from your music library.8) Visit Izar's photo album to view exotic destinations from his travels!9) Take a picture, add Izar to the photo, then share it on Facebook!â We also have a limited free version of Balk Talk in the marketplace. You can try the free app first to make sure your device is fully compatible with the advanced features in Back Talk before purchasing this full version. â1. Talk to IzarTalk / speak / text / sass Izar like you would a friend and he will intelligently answer back, ask you questions, help you with your homework, tell you blonde, Chuck Norris, Yo Mama jokes, trivia, etc. Izar understands literally everything you say and intelligently answers back. Ask Izar ANY question and you will get from a knowledge base of over 1 Billion accumulated facts. Also Ask \"Show me a picture of...\" to view billions of pictures. Unlike the chat bot (chatbot) of yesterday, Izar intelligently learns and grows smarter the more you and other Earthlings talk to him. You control Izar's voice from a squeaky chipmunk to a scary monster. Turn off the universal translator to hear Izar speak in his own language.2. Interact with IzarIzar is fully animated and reacts to every touch and gesture imaginable with hundreds of different sound effects. You can poke, pinch, slap, fling, twirl, touch, shake, decompress, activate gravity, etc. If you make Izar too angry, he'll simulate breaking your screen or zapping you with his ion pulse gun! Be careful about squishing Izar down as he lets out a dozen funny different alien gassers!3. Backwards Recording & PlaybackTurn on Reverse Audio Recording and then press Izar's advanced ship recorder to record yourself talking or singing. Your recording will be played backwards. Send your friend a backwards recording to see if they can figure it out. Record your favorite songs and then play them backwards to listen for secret subliminal messages.4. Voice Changer30+ sound presets to morph your voice recording from squeaky high to monster low.5. Recording Pitch CorrectionSelect one of the pitch correction presets and record yourself singing. Your playback will have an auto tune effect applied, just like T-Pain! Various correction settings allow you to fine tune the key, how strong the effect, how strong to pull to a specific pitch, how smooth the note transitions, etc.6. Duet ModeSelect one of the Mix mode settings and then record yourself singing or talking. When played back, Izar will harmonize a duet with you. Hear your recordings played back with a chorus effect.7. Dance ModeSelect the Dance Loop option and then touch Izar's left foot to activate dance mode. Izar will randomly select and play a song from your music library each time you press his left foot. Izar will analyze the song and will synchronize his dance moves to the song's rhythm.8) Visit Izar's photo album to explore exotic worlds from Izar's travels!9) Take a picture, add Izar to the photo, then share it on Facebook!",
