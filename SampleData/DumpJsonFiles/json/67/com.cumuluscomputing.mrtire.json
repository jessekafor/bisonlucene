        "comment": "I coordinated appointment with this app and was offered a 50% discount on an oil change for using the app. It seemed to run smoothly at first and also received confirmation email and a phone call. However, when at the actual appt., the tires were over $150 more than what I ordered through the app. And the staff complained and couldn\\'t find \\\"that crazy app paperwork\\\". Doing it through this app was more troublesome than physically walking in. Uninstalling.",
