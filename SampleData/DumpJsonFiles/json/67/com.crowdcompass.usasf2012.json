        "comment": "- \\\"My Schedule\\\" is the best part of the app. Would like the \\\"My Schedule\\\" feature to be front and center. Would be great if when I clicked in I could see all \\\"my\\\" events listed against an hourly calendar (not just a list of events) and their location so I could see what I plan to go to when and where on one page. - Too many screens to drill down to get to info. (i.e. Stage Shows/Mainstage/by date/April 29, 2012/list of shows). Please list all in chronological order (1 click off home) as default. Then give sort options across the top of the screen. - Would be nice if all home buttons on one screen (not two screens). Move scrolling tweets to their own page (and were not on the home).  - Nice if Tweets and other social media were all on one screen where I could interact with other event goers (with hashtag or social media activities). Tweets on home are too small and hard to navigate.  - Many (all?) links on the About page are PDFs. Boo. Great info. Hassle to navigate.  Thanks for the free app. Hope my user feedback is constructive. :)",

        "comment": "The amount of information available through the app is amazing. I only wish the map was in color like the one on the website. I do have two other issues with the app, however, affecting my rating.  Every time I start the app it tells me a new version is available. When I click that I would like the newer version, it takes me to Google Play and tells me I already have the latest version.  When you start the app for the first time, it asks you if you want to receive push updates. Whether you select yes or no, there\\'s no way to change this decision afterwards. I\\'d like to be able to dynamically turn push updates on and off, but there isn\\'t a way to do that.",
