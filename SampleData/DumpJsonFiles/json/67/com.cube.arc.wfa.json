        "comment": "I love the entire suite of Red Cross apps.  Overall I find them clean, useful, and well-designed.  Unfortunately, the Wildfire app is a bit lacking in its content.  As I write this, the Fisher Fire just south of Flagstaff, AZ is 50% contained.  The fire was reported well over 24 hours ago.  Fortunately @AzEIN has been tweeting real time updates.  Great apps, but the content needs to be more inclusive and updated much more quickly in order for the app to be considered relevant.  This is the difference between a true emergency app and a mere news app.  Look forward to seeing the next update.",
