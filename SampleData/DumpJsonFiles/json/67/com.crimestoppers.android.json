        "comment": "At first appearance it seems to be pretty decent. It\\'s fairly easy to submit an email or photo or video attachment, which can be a real help. I\\'ll just assume the app records and provides a notification of receipt upon submission as I\\'d rather not clog up Crime Stoppers with useless test photos.  My only gripe is that from a design perspective, the interface is a direct port from the iPhone UI. Don\\'t expect menu buttons to be in logical places, and you can\\'t view in landscape, see videos in full screen or use your native camera app for taking pictures.  Perhaps in a future release we\\'ll see this design changes.",
