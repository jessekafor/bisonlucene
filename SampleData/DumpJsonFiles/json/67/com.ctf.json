    "description": "In Catch the Fruits, you'll be able to use a touch controlled basket to catch, well, fruits. With 7 currently planned regions and over 50 fruits, there's plenty of content to unlock, all completely free if you're good enough or if you share this app with your friends via the game (Don't worry, it'll just post a short status update and log out immediately afterwards). There is a few included help screens in the game that will be displayed upon first installation/whenever you want to view them from the help screen, but I'll lay them out here as well. Five fruits persist throughout all regions: apple, banana, cherries, orange, and tomato. These, as well as the other fruits, have an associated point and weight value. Points add to your score when you catch them, but so does the weight value. You'll need to drag the basket to the right edge of the screen to clear out the basket before it breaks.Upon entering a region, there will be 5 special fruits as well as a special negative item. The special fruits fall faster, but are worth much more than the global fruits. Be wary of the negative items, though, as catching these will put a dent in your score.Also, keep an eye on that fruit/vegetable tomato. Sometimes it's positive, but sometimes it's negative.Upon defeating a level, a grade will be displayed over the level you just defeated. In typical A, B, C, F fashion, an apple indicates an A, a banana a B, and a cherry a C, whereas the open lock icon means you have not yet beaten the level, though it is unlocked. Defeating a level unlocks the next one and defeating all 16 in a region unlocks the next region.ARCADE MODE:While you can miss a few fruits and be okay in the standard play mode, arcade mode requires you to catch every single positive fruit (AND miss every negative item). How long can you make it?STORE:As you earn points throughout the game, you'll be able to buy items in the in-game store, such as different baskets and backgrounds to use for arcade mode. While these can be purchased with in-game points just fine, you can also share this app on Facebook via the game to unlock everything for free!Director and Co-Programmer: Lincoln J RaceHead Programmer and Co-Director: Chirag S ToorSpecial Thanks To:Art Lead: Karina E ChowArt Production: Subhpreet K Kang",
