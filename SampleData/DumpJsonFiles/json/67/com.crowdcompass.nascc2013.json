In addition to practical seminars on the latest design concepts and construction techniques for buildings and bridges, the Conference offers an extensive trade show (featuring products ranging from structural software to machinery for cutting steel beams) and plentiful networking opportunities. It's a once-a-year opportunity to learn the latest techniques, see the most innovative products, and network with your peers and clients. And one low registration fee gains you admittance to technical sessions, keynote address, the T.R. Higgins Lecture, and the exhibition hall.App Keywords: NASCC,Conference,Steel,Construction,Structure,Structural,Fabrication,Engineering,Erection,Detailing",
