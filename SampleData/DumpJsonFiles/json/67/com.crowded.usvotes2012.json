    "description": "Public opinon polls are flawed and have been for years. They rely on professional organizations cold calling individuals for information. National and local news media report consistently on the outcomes of polls which steer public behavior. Advocacy groups use polls to their advantage declaring support for their cause based a sampling of a few hundred people.
