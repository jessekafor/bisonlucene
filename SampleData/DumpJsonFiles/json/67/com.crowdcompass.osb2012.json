    "description": "With mortgage foreclosures continuing to make the headlines, this yearâs bankruptcy institute will include an in-depth look into mortgage management and litigation with a panel of local experts and guest presenters, including the Honorable Keith Lundin and Chapter 13 Trustees Hank Hildebrand and Ronda Winnecour. Other plenary topics will cover bankruptcy decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court, debtors and their LLCs and LLPs, and Chapter 13 recent developments. Professor Mark Yochum will address legal ethics in his presentation, âPositional Conflicts, Pro Bono Publico, and Oaths.â Four breakout sessions will take a look at Schwab and other exemption topics; the perils and pitfalls of first-day motions; drafting Chapter 13 plans; and judicial authority under Stern v. Marshall. The lunch presentation will feature Eric Brunstad sharing his experience arguing a bankruptcy case before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
