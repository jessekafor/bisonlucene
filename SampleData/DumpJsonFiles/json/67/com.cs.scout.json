    "description": "Discover the world of apps, music, and books in a unique way:  by letting SCOUT do the work for you.  SCOUT is easy to use.  Answer a few fun questions the first time you use the app so that SCOUT can figure out who you are.  Youâll see a list of personalized app, music, and book recommendations selected just for you.  Every time you âthumbs upâ or âthumbs downâ recommendations, your list gets even better and youâll find that SCOUT is finding items that you never would have found on your own.  If you see something you like and want to see more items like it, just click on âshow moreâ.   Looking for a particular artist or author?  Click on the search tab and type in what youâre looking for or click on a genre or category.  All of your music and books are available for download through amazon.com.  Youâll need to have the Amazon MP3 player  app installed to download your MP3s and the Amazon Kindle app to download books.  While youâre using SCOUT, youâll encounter C Spire Experts.  Critics and Star Users write reviews for apps, music, and books and they will give you suggestions for other things that you might like.  If you find a Star User that you like, click âfollowâ so that you can find out what apps, books, and music heâs downloading and read his reviews as soon as theyâre available.",

They do however limit app rating Perc Points to 500 per month. Enjoy. To C Spire: Have fun fixing this, hope the ad revenue is worth it.",
