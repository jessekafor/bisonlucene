    "description": "A meteor is the visible path of a meteoroid that has entered the Earth's atmosphere. Meteors typically occur in the mesosphere, and most range in altitude from 75 km to 100 km. Millions of meteors occur in the Earth's atmosphere every day. Most meteoroids that cause meteors are about the size of a pebble. They become visible between about 40 and 75 miles above the Earth. They disintegrate at altitudes of 30 to 60 miles . Meteors have roughly a fifty percent chance of a daylight collision with the Earth. Most meteors are, however, observed at night as low light conditions allow fainter meteors to be observed. They are an amazing slight to look at and we made a 3D live Wallpaper out of it within a cube. We added 2 light source for the extra sparkle. Features include:Options for transparent box2 different light sourceOption to move lightOption to change viewing angle and change background color.Option for Auto rotation with speed control, or manual control with finger swipe.",
