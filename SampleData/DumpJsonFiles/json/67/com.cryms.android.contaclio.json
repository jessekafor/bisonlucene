    "description": "The ContaClioâs App is the multimedia version of one of the tests you can find in the game show Â«Molla l'ossoÂ» on air at Swiss Television.The goal of the game is to count how many Clios will be left in the dog's bed at the end of each round.If your answer is right you go to a higher level, but if your answer is wrong you will have to try again at the same level.Each round begins with the empty dog's bed and, starting from the fifth level, along with the classic white Clios you must also count the black Clio's left in the dog's bed.After you have commited three errors the game ends, and if you have improved your record you can insert it in the ranking of the ten best results.If you exit ContaClio and leave the game unfinished, the next time you start the App you will have the opportunity to resume the game at the same level or start a new game altogether.",
