    "description": "Dear Colleagues, On behalf of the American Society of Anesthesiologists it is with great pleasure that I invite you to attend our upcoming annual meeting, ANESTHESIOLOGY 2012, being held in Washington, D.C. from October 13- 17, 2012. As the worldâs premier anesthesiology meeting, the gathering offers high level scientific and educational lectures, panels, discussions and workshops, along with incredible networking opportunities in a great location â Washington D.C. This yearâs theme, Transforming Patient Safety Through Education and Advocacy, will continue to highlight the advances that we as a specialty have made in ensuring that our patients remain safe throughout the perioperative period. It will also use the backdrop of Washington D.C., just a few weeks before the national election, to stress the importance of advocacy in furthering our efforts to ensure patient safety. The opening ceremony will highlight Political commentators James Carville and Mary Matalin who will discuss politics from both sides of the aisle. Itâs a perfect way to highlight the election season at our meeting. As international attendance grows at the ASA annual meetings we have added more offerings to appeal to our international participants. In this election year, and as annual meeting chair, I am confident that you will vote ANESTHESIOLOGY 2012 the best, most educational and most enjoyable meeting you will attend all year. Plan on attending what will be a most memorable meeting. Sincerely, Andrew D. Rosenberg M.D. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2012 ChairKeywords: ASA, ASA 2012, Anesthesiology, Anesthesiology 2012, Anesthesia, Anes, Washington DC, Annual Meeting",
