Punching and blocking seems easy, but the timing of these two moves is what counts.  The graphics are clean and crisp and the sound compliments the gameplay nicely.  Unlocking new outfits is fun and the training between matches is a nice toutch.  Playing against real opponents over wi-fi works fine and is a welcome addition to a solid game. Fun for a few minutes or a few hours. Playtime 5.5 hours. Thanks",

        "comment": "It\\'s an okay game but considering what we usually get for the prices here, I could only give it 5 stars if it was $1.  At $3 it\\'s just pretty good.  If there was IAP I\\'d down vote it to 3 stars but since it\\'s the full game with no sneaky IAP it settles nicely at 4.  Except for some special moves and finishing off, there are only two main boxing buttons (punch & block).  You can figure out timing of the punch button presses tho to have a little more control over the type of punch being thrown.  There is training between matches too after a bit that let\\'s you try to raise one of the three main stats.  Edit - Challenge was changed so you can win without it (you still do at least one but it doesn\\'t happen non stop anymore even if you totally dominate the match).  So that complaint is gone.  Is actually pretty fun overall too.",
