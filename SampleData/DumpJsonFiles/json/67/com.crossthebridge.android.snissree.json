    "description": "Click on the traveler to make him stand on the bridge, click on the arrow to make him/her cross the bridge. Only one traveler can hold the lantern at any given time. Only two travelers can cross the bridge simultaneously. Your village is under massive attack from a hostile country. As the leader of the neighborhood, you need to protect and escort the villagers to hide in the mountains. You come across a dangerous bridge at night, but your oil lamp can only last 30 minutes. You have to arrange properly so that everybody can walk across the bridge before the light goes out. When the game starts, 5 people will stay in front of the cliff. Each person has a different walking speed counted in minutes, as indicated in the dialogue boxes. Click up to 2 persons each time, and they will walk across the bridge. Note that the oil lamp must be carried by a person, and therefore you must also count the time of carrying the lamp back and forth. The remaining life of the lamp is shown at the top left corner; you lose the game if you cannot complete the mission within the time limit. Seize your time before the light extinguishes!How to Play: Cross the Bridge is a game with 1 levels. Each person walks at a different speed: 1 sec, 3 sec, 6 sec, 8 sec & 12 sec this is displayed in an icon next to that person. Match the correct travelers to cross the bridge; you have only 30 seconds before the lamp runs out of fuel.",
