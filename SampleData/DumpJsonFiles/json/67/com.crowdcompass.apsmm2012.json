        "comment": "This app has some useful features and is worth downloading. Yes, it uses a lot of memory, but it runs pretty quickly and does not depend on a fast data connection. It allows bookmarking of talks and has several schedule display modes, but the big problem for me is that there is no way to display ONLY bookmarked talks. Ideally this feature would interface with My Schedule on the APS site. Unless they add this feature before Monday, the app won\\'t replace my division\\'s printed booklet.",

Looking up talks is cumbersome, and the personal schedule view sucks (why was this not a feature in the first version?!) There\\'s no way to interface with any other scheduler or calendar, just a useless twitter feed. I really hope the APS didn\\'t spend too much on this, because it\\'s one of the worst apps I\\'ve used.",

Implement click through navigation so that if I search by author and find a talk I can click a link to see all talks in that session and all talks listing that author, even as secondary author.  Get rid of all that tweet crap. Stop trying to access the internet. It causes the app to freeze.  Maps. Show me on the map where a session is. Show me where the speaker ready room",
