    "description": "Is it the time to master interview questions and answers. Here we present you the whole collection all at once. This is exactly what you need, a must have app.- All questions are well organized- Under each category you will have the whole list of questions - For each question you have multiple answers* To cater frequent updates and improvements an option is given in the start* Additionally you can edit and improve any question and its answer. Moreover you can send request to update your contribution on server for other people.  This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
