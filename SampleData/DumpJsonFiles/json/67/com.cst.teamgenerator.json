    "description": "TeamGenerator is a must have app if you play team-based games usually. It helps you generate random teams for any task, for example:â Board gamesâ Sports gamesâ Any team-based activities...First, you have to add some users. After that you can generate teams with checking them. You can view the history at any time.Note that you can remove a user by long clicking on it and deleted users in History appear in bracelets (so in \"(name)\" form). As for the 1.1 update you can long clicking on a history entry and delete it. Also possible to delete all user or history entry with the \"trash\" icon above their tabs.Supported languages are English and Hungarian.Internet permission needs for Ads.",

        "comment": "The best thing with this app is that it is simple and works, kinda. But it has some major flaws: * You can\\'t delete individual persons, aka if you spell them wrong or you don\\'t want them in the list anymore, you must delete everyone and start over.  * You need to specify both how many teams and how many that should be in each team. With a little help of some simple math you should only need to input one of them. Now you can\\'t have uneven teams. So yeah, beginning with that stuff is a start.",
