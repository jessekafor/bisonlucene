    "description": "During the second academic year of EcoCAR 2: Plugging In to the Future, teams have been developing prototype advanced technology vehicles, and will come together in May to compete in more than a dozen dynamic and static events at this yearâs competition. From May 13-23, 2013, teams will gather for the EcoCAR 2 Year Two Competition at the General Motors Desert Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona and at locations throughout San Diego, California to compete in more than a dozen technical, communications, and business events. Throughout the ten days, vehicles will undergo engineering tests similar to those conducted by the automotive industry to determine a prototypeâs readiness for production, and ultimately prove the viability of their advanced technology vehicles.Keywords: EcoCAR 2, General Motors, U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne, Automotive Engineering, Plug-In Hybrid",
