        "comment": "Fun game to pass the time with friends and family. The ranking system, however, is flawed. It gauges who knows who best based on the number of correct answers as opposed to the percentage of answers guessed correctly. So if you start a game with someone new they\\'re never going to \\\"know you\\\" as well as someone you\\'ve been playing with for a while. Also I dont get notifications on my android when its my turn.",

Some questions have answers that are too similar. Some questions have odd wording that makes them hard to follow. (The use of they and them too often.) The ads will be invisible since the last update so I end up clicking the big full screen ones while trying to load up a game. Same happens with the exit game window. The sound on/off setting resets randomly.",
