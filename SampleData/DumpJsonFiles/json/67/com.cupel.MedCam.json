    "description": "Measure the pulse and respiration rate of yourself and others using your camera.To use: - Steady the camera by resting it on a table (for example). - Position your face in the top box and shoulders in the bottom box. - Push 'Start' and keep still while the measurement is in progress. - Your pulse and respiration rate will be displayed. - Select \"Switch camera\" from the menu to change the camera (on supported phone).How it works: - Movement of your chest is used to measure respiration rate. - Small changes in reflectivity from your face are used to measure pulse.  Each heart beat our faces pulsate - changing in reflectivity by about 1%, if these changes were 2% then we would be able to see them with our eyes, at 1% they are just detectable with a smartphone camera (after a few seconds of measurement).Disclaimer: This remote sensing software is fallible and so it is not recommended for important measurements.Requires a phone with a front-facing camera and Android 2.3 or higher.",
