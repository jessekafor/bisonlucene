        "comment": "Full points in the brush response. It\\'s the third best I\\'ve  experienced so far on my Samsung Note. (behind Autodesk Sketchbook and the short lived TVpaint beta)   Layer palette with the blend mode options is great. And I really like the symmetry tools implementation.  A couple of suggestions:  An option for each brush to reset to original default values. A view option to hide the bottom corner control icons until the centre puck is tapped (it\\'s great that they duck out while drawing but little distracting)",

        "comment": "I\\'ve used EVERY drawing app on Android, in search of \\'the one\\'. And I suspect this might be it.   Layers are vital in a professional painting app. They\\'re here, and they\\'re excellent. Easy to use, easy to manipulate.  The user interface is gorgeous. Borrows a bit from Infinite Design, using flyouts. Easy, inconspicuous, ready for action.  The only thing that would make it better is faster control of sizing the brush. (And it might very well be there. Maybe I just need to discover the mechanism.)  Excellent!",
