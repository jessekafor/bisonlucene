        "comment": "I am a fellow dev for android and I have a daughter and saw this app on youtube so i downloaded first on her Tablet 7 inch and the screen was way way too big i think it would only work or be compatible with 10 inch which is something you should consider.. After i then downloaded the ABC version which i assumed is for phones but... Again Failed on the phone in the ABC wont boot and I Have Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (trust me it can do everything) But you app doesnt work.. I started to jus download the cracked version but wasnt worth the time if it fails on my tablet and my Note 2. I think you should take the app down and work out the kinks and bugs. .The idea its selft and the layout has GREAT potential but as is now.. sorry to say better off with regualr kids apps that actually function properly on android devices.. 5 stars after bugs are worked out",
