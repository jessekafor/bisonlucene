        "comment": "This bad app is a \\\"3\\\" because my city\\'s good response to my reports. Otherwise it would get a \\\"2-minus.\\\"   I sent CitySourced a bug list nearly 2 months ago and none have been fixed.  Problems with v1.5.1 include: (a) Map doesn\\'t always show up.  (b) If you manually type an address because the map is acting up, the app ignores the typed-in address and uses whatever crazy location the map thinks it is at.  In my case, this meant a wrong city, so my report was never seen by my city.  (c) Boxes disappear.  (d) I can\\'t turn my phone sideways to use a wider keyboard.  (e) When I click on Reports...List View...and select one of my reports, it shows the correct photo.  When I click on the photo, it shows the photo of another report I\\'ve submitted.  (f) You get alerts when a case is closed. Click on the alert and it disappears without telling you which case closed.  (g) The app says you\\'re limited to 3 attached photos per report, yet I can attach 4.  I would like more than 4 in some cases.  (h) It takes much to many clicks to attach multiple photos to a report. - - - - - If you are a city, you want people using the app and I can see people not using this app because of its faults.",
