        "comment": "This is def one of my favorite games I can literally play it for hours I highly reccomend it. It does get a bit chellenging after level 60 only thing I would change is that you should be able to bypass levels if you cant beat them and then come back to it later but other then that its great",

        "comment": "Once the new wears off using the accelerometer having to tip the tablet to scrolls is just time consuming and tiring. Drag would be So much better. Also the tip just seems backwards to me. Lastly when I got to level 27 it appears to have a bug. Everything goes where it belongs but the game says I still lose. Really wish I hadn\\'t bought this.",
