There are two control schemes(swipe and on screen buttons)to try out to see which is better for you. Gems are everywhere even when destroying environment and for $2 you can double the collection rate. Heman is powerful but shera is quicker and jumps higher. Thanks to support for detailing the iap(3 types)for me before buying the game. Very happy with the $3 I spent.",

There are some minor inaccuracies with the He-Man universe in the game, but the quality of the game more than makes up for that! Highly recommended!",
