Go to \" Channing Tatum Live Wallpaper\" and press \"set wallpaper\".Channing Matthew Tatum (born April 26, 1980) is an American actor and film producer, best known for his roles in Step Up (2006), G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), Dear John (2010), The Vow (2012), 21 Jump Street (2012), Magic Mike (2012), and G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013). He has also appeared in films such as Coach Carter (2005), She's the Man (2006), A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints (2006), Fighting (2009), and The Dilemma (2010). While known for his dramatic performances in Dear John and The Vow, he has also ventured into more comedic roles. Earlier in his career he worked variously as a dancer, model, and stripper.In 2008, Tatum co-starred in director Kimberly Peirce's film Stop-Loss, about soldiers returning home from the Iraq War, and in director Stuart Townsend's film Battle in Seattle, about the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. Tatum played in the short film The Trap.Tatum and Dito Montiel, who worked together on A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, reteamed on the action drama Fighting for Rogue Pictures. Tatum starred as Sean McArthur, a young man who scrapes up a living scalping tickets in New York City. Tatum next appeared in writer/director/producer Michael Mann's 2009 crime drama Public Enemies, playing the 1930s American gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. The same year, Tatum starred as Duke in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Paramount Pictures' live-action film based on the popular Hasbro action figures. He was initially reluctant to take the role as he feared the movie would glorify war. However, he overcame his reluctance when he read the script. He played a soldier in Dear John, a Screen Gems film based on a popular Nicholas Sparks bestseller. He later stated that he accepted the role to learn from Lasse HallstrÃ¶m as he had never studied at an acting school.Jenna Dewan, Deborah Scranton, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, documentary subject Jean Pierre Sagahutu, producer Reid Carolin and executive producer Tatum attend the premiere of Earth Made of Glass.In an interview with Details magazine, published in early 2012, Tatum said he wants to produce all the films he stars in, \"I really don't want to be in any more movies that I don't produce. Unless it's with one of the 10 directors that I really want to work with, I don't have any interest in not being on the ground floor of creating it.\" He, his wife Jenna Dewan, and their production partner Reid Carolin signed a two-year production deal in 2010 with Relativity Media for any movies they may develop during that time.In 2012, Tatum hosted Saturday Night Live and appeared in four films. He co-starred in Steven Soderbergh's Haywire, The Vow with Rachel McAdams, and 21 Jump Street (the film adaptation of TV series of the same name) with Jonah Hill. He also starred in Magic Mike, a film about his eight-month experience as a male stripper in Florida. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh, was co-produced by Tatum and Soderbergh, and starred Tatum as Mike - one of the central performers at a Tampa, Florida, male strip club who takes a younger dancer (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing in hopes of showing him how to hustle \"on and off stage.\" The film's cast also included Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, and Matthew McConaughey.Tag:- Channing Tatum Live Wallpaper, Channing Tatum Wallpaper, Live Wallpaper, G.
