Whether it be a stream or a road, it just looks like someone rubbed there finger there the art before it dried. Can play thru but just annoying. I even bought the game. Buying doesn\\'t stop the adds as advertised either. Still asks me if I want to get rid of them but then tells me I already own them. Such a shame the game is fun. Trued uninstalling and reinstalling, no go",
