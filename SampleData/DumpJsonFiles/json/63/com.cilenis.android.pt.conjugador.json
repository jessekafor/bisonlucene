    "description": "Learn, check, and discover all forms of the verb you are interested in. Just, insert a verb in infinitive form, and Portuguse Conjugator will show you all forms of the variety you have previously chosen (European or Brazilian, before or after Orthographic Agreement). Moreover, you can verify whether the verb is known (accepted by a specific Orthographic Norm), and, even if it is not the case, you can conjugate the verb as well, since Portuguese Conjugator is an automatic system based on rules. And remember, Portuguese Conjugator conjugates both European and Brazilian Portuguse, both before and after the Orthographic Agreement.  Portuguese Conjugator also has a web version at your's disposal, free and without ads, which is provided by Cilenis. The system is based on free software conjugue, corrected, improved, and enriched by Cilenis. The application for Android was developped by GalApps for Cilenis.

        "comment": "This app is not bad. I have been searching for an alternative app to Robert Muth which is good and this app will do the job. However I would say that it does not have all the tenses and requires internet connection which isn\\'t ideal but it works fine... If these 2 things were changed this would be the best Portuguese verb conjugator.",
