        "comment": "This app is a real time-saver.  It\\'s fast, there are no ads, and you don\\'t need any weird special permissions to run it.  It\\'s clear where the attack bonus is, but it\\'s a little boring?  Maybe make it bigger?   Also, it\\'d be great if the app would save your settings when you close it, although it\\'s extremely easy to set it back up, especially since it loads so quickly.  I like the icon.  5/5",
