Two taps on your iPhone is all it takes.Hereâs how it works:â¢ You're out late and you lose track of your friends. Use Circle of 6 to send your circle a âcome and get meâ message- with a map using GPS to show your precise location.â¢ You're on a date that starts to get uncomfortable. You need a polite way to excuse yourself. Use Circle of 6 to alert your circle to call you and interrupt the situation.â¢ You're seeing someone new, but you have some doubts about how things are going. Use Circle of 6 to access a wealth of online information about healthy relationships.â¢ In critical situations, use Circle of 6 to call two pre-programmed national hotlines or a local emergency number of your choice.About us:Circle of 6 is a project of YTH (formerly ISIS) and Tech for Good, Inc.

        "comment": "Actually, you don\\'t need 6 people to use this app. You can fill in as few as you want, and double up to complete the number 6.  Discovering and using this app has been such a great safety net, especially living in NYC. I have found it extremely useful in getting out of  uncomfortable social situations with drunken men. Also recently, I was followed by a creepy man from the subway, but thanks to circle of six, my neighborhood friend was waiting for me in front of my apartment by the time I arrived.",

As others have said, it would be much better if you had the option to use less than 6 people or maybe even have the option to choose one of the 6 instead of sending a message out to everyone. Also, I think you should have the option to edit the text message that the app sends out. As for things that should be fixed or looked into, when I go to the settings menu within the app, nothing happens. I would also like to see this app be able to be moved to the SD card.",

I think this app would be great to have, and I know it\\'ll save people from disastrous outcomes, but making it unusable if you don\\'t fill in all six contacts is very effective at defeating the purpose of the whole thing.  Please remove the mandatory \\\"filling all six slots\\\" requirement; it\\'ll be far more helpful for people who aren\\'t lucky enough to have that many trusted people.",
