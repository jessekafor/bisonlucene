This one is flexible enough to allow parents to track patterns and comment on whatever the concern is. The highly visual traffic light system is easily understood by the child without having to labour the point. Sometimes a little confusing navigating though historical data but overall my favourite behaviour app.",

I needed something that was quick, but also allowed me to communicate with parents and behaviorists.  This app has saved me so much time and allowed me to track their behaviors more efficiently.  I love the graph and the ability to send others an email with the tracking data.  It has helped me to document and to gain services for my students.",
