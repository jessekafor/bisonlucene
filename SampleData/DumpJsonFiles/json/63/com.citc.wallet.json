    "description": "ABOUT POCKETPocket allows you to safely store all your sensitive data such as bank account details and passwords on your phone. Pocket is also useful for remembering all those bits and pieces of information in one place from frequent flier numbers to contact lens prescriptions.SECURE YOUR INFORMATIONPocket is all about security. Many people still store their sensitive information under contacts, which can easily be seen if your phone falls into the wrong hands...ouch! When you use Pocket, your data is encrypted using the industry standard AES-256. Only you will be able to access your data via a master password. Even if you lose your phone your data will still be safe. For extra security, Pocket doesn't store your master password locally on the device, but rather as a SHA-512 hash. In addition, Pocket self-locks after a timeout period and clears the clipboard to ensure your data is protected.ONLINE DROPBOX BACKUPPocket provides an option to automatically backup your wallet to your Dropbox account. All communication to Dropbox is over HTTPS and the data itself is encrypted so that even if your Dropbox account is compromised, your data is inaccessible without the master password.DESKTOP VERSIONNew beta desktop version now available. (Click 'Visit the developer's web page' for the download links).PRO VERSIONGet the PRO version key to remove ads.",

There are no XHDPI resources so the app UI looks very blurry on current devices. Wallbase has nice fresh interface but here is nothing about Holo. Support simple not answer for my questions. Sync features not offer all current possibilities. I bought it long time before but even there are no new version for separate new cost. So seems the product is almost dead.",
