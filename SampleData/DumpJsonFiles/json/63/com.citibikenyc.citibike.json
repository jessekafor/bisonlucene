    "description": "Note:  As updated station and bike information becomes available, it will automatically be reflected in the app.The official Citi Bike App is the perfect co-pilot for all your biking adventures in the city. From station locations to bike availability to route planning, and now with tips from The Scoop by The New York Times, youâll even know where to find a great lattÃ© or steak. Youâll have all the info you need to unlock the possibilities of New York. With 600 planned locations in New York, there'll be more Citi Bike stations than tattoo parlors. To find one, just explore the map, which shows every station in the city with a simple pin that also gives bike and dock availability. Or use the search bar and check out all the stations near your chosen location. Soon you'll know your way around town better than a New York cabbie. Just tap a station pin or location and the app will sniff out the quickest way to your destination before you can say, \"Hey, I'm early again.\" Whether you're searching for Citi Bike stations, restaurants, stores, museums or anything else, there's nothing you won't have an answer for. The search results will always list stations at the top of the list and include bike/space availability at a glance.",

For me, typically, there are more bikes available and fewer docks that reported in the app.  (b) Functionality -- it seems like a no brainer to have a bike lane routing function in the app.",
