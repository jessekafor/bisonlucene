        "comment": "After quite a few updates, some that rendered the app almost unusable, we seem to finally be back at a decent, stable version. The new ability to shift time errors in the settings is very welcome.  Now I just have to wait to see if the ever present bug that was plaguing push notifications is still present, I also see multiples for some shows of the same episode. None of these are deal breakers though. This is once again, a fantastic app.",
