    "description": "Drum Set Wallpapers and Theme ApplicationA drum set is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments set up to be played by a single player. The traditional drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones. More recently kits have also included electronic instruments, with both hybrid and entirely electronic kits now in common use.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
