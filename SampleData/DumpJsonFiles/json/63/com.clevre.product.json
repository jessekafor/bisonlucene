Any given input that produces an output field will be displayed immediately, saving time and efficiency for eCommerce invoice creators. It is perfect for consumers who place phone call orders worldwide as you can now provide them with exact details of their order without the hassle of creating an official invoice or using a calculator. You will no longer need them to hold the line while you figure out the details of their order. There are many options that you can customize, such as applying tax on just the price of the item(s) or applying it to the price plus its shipping. This system is set up to instantly convert all tabs to any currency of your choice, making it convenient for buyers in (for example) the US to purchase items located in Canada.Key words: sales calculator, shipping calculator, discount calculator, invoice calculator, invoice creator, tax calculator, tax sales, purchase calculator, purchase invoice, calculator sales, purchase order, order calculator, billing invoice, product calculator, freight calculator",
