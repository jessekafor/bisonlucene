The film was directed by Blake Edwards and released by Paramount Pictures. It is loosely based on the novella of the same name by Truman Capote.Hepburn's portrayal of Holly Golightly as the naÃ¯ve, eccentric cafÃ© society girl is generally considered to be the actress' most memorable and identifiable role. She herself regarded it as one of her most challenging roles, since she was an introvert required to play an extrovert. Hepburn's performance of its theme song \"Moon River\" helped composer Henry Mancini and lyricist Johnny Mercer win an Oscar for Best Song.In 2012, the film was added to the US National Film RegistryOne early morning, a yellow taxi pulls up at Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, and elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. Standing outside the shop window looking into the windows, she nibbles on pastry and drinks coffee she brought with her, then strolls home to go to bed. Outside her apartment, she fends off her date Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud) from the disastrous night before, who has been waiting in his car overnight. Later in the day she is awakened by new neighbor-tenant, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), ringing her doorbell to get into the building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a mobster incarcerated at Sing Sing prison. Tomato's lawyer O'Shaunessey pays her $100 a week to receive \"the weather report.\"Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly.As she is leaving for Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), who Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, Holly goes out onto the building's fire escape to elude an over-eager date (Mel Blanc). She peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving money and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly enters Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who has not had anything published in five years since writing a book of vignettes titled Nine Lives. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money in order to support her brother, Fred, when he gets out of the Army. The pair fall asleep, but are awoken when Holly has a nightmare about Fred and leaves the apartment. She later buys Paul a new typewriter ribbon to apologize and invites him to a party at her apartment. At the party, Paul meets her Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl into Manhattan socialite. He is also introduced to JosÃ© da Silva Pereira (JosÃ© Luis de Vilallonga), a rich Brazilian, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), a rich American.",
