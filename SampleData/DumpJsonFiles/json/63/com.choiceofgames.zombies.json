        "comment": "It was an entertaining game, and I\\'m glad I bought the special forces add-on - frankly, playing through it as a trigger happy special forces character was hilarious. That being said, I was pretty disappointed with the game overall. It lacked any real tension, and the character interactions were hollow at times. I wanted to get to know my fellow survivors, but was never given the chance. They\\'re pretty much there just to fill space/fill a role. There was also a lack of romance options. In general, the whole story felt rushed. It doesn\\'t hold up well compared to their earlier games.",
