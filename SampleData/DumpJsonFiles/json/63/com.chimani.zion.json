        "comment": "The app is an awesome idea and the trail descriptions are very helpful and detailed. In practice when using it the map would just be blank when the my location feature is used (nexus s), when zooming the map and then scrolling the zoom level was reset each time So it has a lot of potential but needs some polishing",
