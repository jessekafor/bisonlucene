I\\'m not always required to stay on these calls, so it would be great if they allowed me to choose one person to be presenter and a separate person to be host. Also, why doesnt the host have the option to record to the webex server if using the mobile app?",

Listening to a meeting is a whole other story in itself. Quite disappointed actually. I will be uninstalling this app and will not be using it on either my mobile or tablet until they fix the whole audio thing. Meetings I attend dont even have the call in feature to utilize that as an option to listen in. And i can imagine how much extra work that is just to ATTEND a meeting. Citrix, do what you do best...stick to computer software. Maybe apps just isnt your \\\"thing\\\".",
