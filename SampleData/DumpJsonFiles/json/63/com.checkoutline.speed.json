    "description": "Its the classic fun card game \"Speed\" with decks themed as the joker cards of Insane Clown Posse's Dark Carnival.Requires two players but only one android device.Race your friends, great for parties.Rules: both players are given 20 cards, only 5 at a time are faced up. 2 cards are faced up in the middle, the 5 cards in your deck that are facing up can be placed onto the 2 cards in the middle if they are the next in sequence in either ascending or descending order. There are two piles of cards faced down at each side, only if neither player has a card faced up that is next in sequence to either of the 2 cards in the middle then 2 cards from  faced down ones at the sides are placed face up onto the 2 cards in the middle when the middle button is pressed. First player to get rid of all their 20 cards wins!!Restart the game by turning the screen vertically up and then back to horizontal.rate this shit 5 stars bitch.but fuck this app, checkout my magazine app series \"FuckMTV\", its free and its all kinds of fucked up, so download it then tell your bitch ass friends about it. oh yea, but download this one too:",
