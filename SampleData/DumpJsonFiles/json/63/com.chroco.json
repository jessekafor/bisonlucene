This app is easy to use, with a clean UI, and has EVERYTHING I need; multiple counters, adjustable increments, start at and add any amount, and best of all can exceed 7 digits, which you won\\'t find in any others. Add to that a log you can export, plus it\\'s free and ad-free. NOTE TO DEVS; please don\\'t abandon this app, people would pay, it really is best in class. Thank you ;-)",

        "comment": "I wanted a tally program to help me keep track of several different things to help me change my habits, from the amount of time I spend in front of the TV to how many calories I eat in a day. This app can be tailored for just about anything you can think of in terms of counting. For time, you can set the units to minutes/hours/days/etc. It\\'s got units for calories, distance, weight, dollars, cigarettes, laps and more. You can even define your own units. You can also define the size of the increments, for instance, I wanted to count my time spent in front of the TV 15 minutes at a time and this app does that. It also lets you define the reset value; if I wanted to limit myself to 2000 calories a day, I could set the reset value at 2000 calories and then count backwards to 0, then the next day when I hit reset on the counter, it resets back to 2000. The interface is clean, simple and elegant. You can even put a widget for each counter on your home screen. The author of this app thought of just about everything and you\\'re not going to find a better app of this type. Even better, this app is free, though I would pay money for it without hesitation.",
