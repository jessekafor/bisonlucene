        "comment": "Great app all around. Instead of just helping me pick one good activity like most apps, this one helps me string together a full day of things to do.  It factors in what kinds of things I like / want to do (i.e. museums, bars, parks, restaurants), where I am starting and ending my day, how close things are together and their open hours, etc. The app then matches up all that up with user ratings and gives you a full itinerary of activities, personalize just for you.  You can then edit the itinerary once you\\'",

        "comment": "Very useful way to make the most of a trip to San Diego. App lets you pick what you know you want to see and suggests other destinations for you, then lays out a plan that puts everything in the best order with appropriate time at each destination and travel time in-between. Tripadvisor, Yelp and Facebook reviews are included in the profiles of each destination (and there a a wide variety of them) so it saves a lot of research time deciding where you want to go. You can customize suggestions by letting the app know whether you have a car or like to walk, are traveling with kids, on a budget, etc. Slick design too. Nice job - I\\'ll look for more smart guides from these guys for sure.",

        "comment": "I travel quite a lot, and while sometimes I like figuring out all the logistics and details of what I\\'m going to do, increasingly I\\'d just rather focus on the doing-- and this app helps me do just that.  The interface is super intuitive, and in just a few clicks I can get some information targeted to my interests and logistical requirements-- something that would otherwise take me ages of cross-referencing google maps, yelp and other rating sites, public transportation schedules, and so on.  It just cuts out SO many annoying details that, for someone like me who can get a bit hung up on making the  \\\"right\\\" decision, take on the extra burden of stress.  The app is such a relief!!!",
