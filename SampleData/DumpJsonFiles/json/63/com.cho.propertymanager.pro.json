        "comment": "I appreciate that the developers are actively working on updates and improvements for this app. I\\'m giving it 5 stars because even though there are a few minor things that need work... I am confident that it will be perfect in no time! There is only one other app available that I can find made for landlords and it will not work on my tablet and they are making no effort to improve it. I\\'m glad I found this app.. it sure makes managing my rental properties easier!!  I love the new update for tablets....it works great on my Toshiba Thrive tablet! Keep up the Good Work and I look forward to future updates!!!",
