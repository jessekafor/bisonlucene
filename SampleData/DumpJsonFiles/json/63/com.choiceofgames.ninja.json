But the diction level is only moderate, it can be a little vague at times, there are a couple grammar/spelling errors, it\\'s slightly linear and it\\'s pretty short with an ending that\\'s more abrumpt than a cliff hanger.",

        "comment": "The concept is good, well written, and well thought out but the execution leaves a bit to be desired. While its easy to get immersed in the world, you find that the ending is abrupt and there are too few paths explored and relationships unfulfilled. This story had the potential to be one of the best CoG but the author left too much of it unexplored which left me wanting. Still, its a good story but only average because of the execution.",

        "title": "Kinda mediocre",
        "comment": "Great idea and was getting good but then a rather rushed and abrupt ending hit like a What? Moment. More accurate score is 3.5 honestly though the quality of the post-free CoG like Choice of Vampire etc that has been released, has been mediocre down to straight poor. Exception would be Choice of Kung Fu, Heros and the Zombie one only as that seemed to be the only 5 from CoG in a long time.",

Each choice seemed only to affect the outcome of that situation, with a few throw away choices where the effects were interrupted by the story on the next page. Overall it felt like a short story with a few minor sidetracks instead of a full Choice Of game. I recommend this publisher, but not this game.",
