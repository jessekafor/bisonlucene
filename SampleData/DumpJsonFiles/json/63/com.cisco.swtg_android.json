Sometimes, I need to start a case for a customer who has a 4-hour SLA and simply can\\'t get back to my desk or boot up my laptop to start a TAC case. This app allows me to start, finish and resolve a case without ever touching a physical keyboard. I haven\\'t tried any of the features listed in the latest update, but I\\'m sure I will, given my past reliance on it.   Note: I have used the IOS version of this app more extensively. Recently switched to an Android phone.",
