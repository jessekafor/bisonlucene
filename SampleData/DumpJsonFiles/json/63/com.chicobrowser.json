        "comment": "The browser seems reasonably good in most ways. But it doesn\\'t prompt you to set it up, and it\\'s default setting is NO FILTERING. I didn\\'t notice this until today. My teen-ager has had access to this browser for a week because I thought it was safe!   Also, this isn\\'t really a free app. It\\'s a free trial. With other great free choices, why should anyone pay for this one?",
