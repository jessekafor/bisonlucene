        "comment": "I love most of the other CoG games but this one is definitely a step down. It\\'s rather short and very linear. IMO, not really worth the $2.99.  Maybe .99 at most.    It\\'s not bad, but it definitely could be fleshed out a bit more, especially the relationships with your crew and the ambassadors, as well as the battles. If this was done, then the price would be justified I think.",

        "comment": "After the last release, City of the Clouds, I thought COG was gonna take a nose dive and never recover again, but the fleet seems quite good, actually.  Just a bug to report, after I spoke to the empress of the Alliance, I found that my force had turned to elegance.  A major problem as I next had to make that speech about force over elegance.  P.S.  Us it possible to be a military dictator?  Overthrow the alliance, take over with the lieutenant?",
