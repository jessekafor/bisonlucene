    "description": "** This application is not endorsed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints **Have you ever wondered what it would be like to travel in Nephi's footsteps?  What would it take to actually follow your father, Lehi, into the wilderness with your family?  Would you be able to leave all of your possessions behind and travel into the wilderness?  Here is your chance to find out...Play the part of Nephi as you travel into the desert, from leaving Jerusalem to gathering the plates and Ishmael's family to building the ship to carry you to the promised land.  Find out what it was like to follow the Liahona, make a bow and go hunting with no guarantee of finding enough food to live to see tomorrow, or build a ship large enough to carry you and your family across the sea.Feel like being mischievous?  If you prefer, play the part of the opposition.  Will you be a Jerusalemite, comfortable with the status quo even though your city is about to be destroyed?  Or will you be a Babylonian, ready to conquer the entire Arabian peninsula?  Maybe you will choose to be a Desert Raider and pillage and loot whomever you can find, whether they cook their food before eating it or not.  Or you may choose to be a Merchant, selling food, camels, and arms to whomever is in power at the moment... or to whomever wants to be in power.  What will you choose?No matter which of the five heritages you choose, you won't be alone.  The game is entirely social, so you don't just perform quests by yourself.  Band together with your heritage, create a clan or join one, and go raiding as a group, all online at the same time.  Send messages to a specific player you have met in the game, your clan, your entire extended family, the region in which you live, or use our forums to spread your message to all players at once.Communicate with each other to plan strategy and attacks, or to plan a defense against them.  Or is that new player a spy from a rival family?  Boost the stats of your friendly players, but be wary of those trying to weaken you and your clan.",

One wrong move can mean all your experience vanishes and it can take months to get back to where you were. An inconsiderate player getting a high rank could mean you can never progress past the first quests.",
