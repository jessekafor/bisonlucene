On the desktop version you choose a ranking to play against which is a lot better of a system, especially for people who want to play a casual game, not some hardcore computer stuck on max difficulty.",

The Play Online part is the really the useful function from the app. I don\\'t see myself every playing Live Chess on the phone screen.",
