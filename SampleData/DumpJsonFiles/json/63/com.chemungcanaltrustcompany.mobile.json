        "comment": "A more clear picture of what the account looks like would be nice....not just a running log of deposits and withdraws.  Having a running balance rather than just the amount in the listed at the top would help out.  Also, the ability to click on a transaction (like a check) so you can see what it is.  I don\\'t run around all day with my ledger in hand so being able to see the check that cleared while on the road would be great.",
