    "description": "Life should always be this easy, this fun and this free.Unchained from the norm, Conway's Life GL will do more than play a simple set of rules: With it you can ultimately shape your automata's destiny. Empowered with the ability to choose any and all combinations of life and death rules, we place no restraint on your exploration in the mathematical labyrinth of cellular automata.This fun app is a full featured Life Game, allowing the user to change the birth and survival rules to see the full range of two-dimensional cellular automata systems. See chaotic systems and slowly emergent systems, depending on the rules chosen. Vary colors, speed and shapes. No other Life Game implements rule setting.",

        "comment": "Things seem to have improved since the last time i used it. The touch is still inaccurate, but better than before. The annoying startup ad is gone.  One glitch is that when you pan with two fingers, occasionally it makes a few random pixels of life. Zoom could also be integrated into the two-finger gesture. *Old review: The app starts with a plea to click an ad. Random always seems to create two gliders at the exact same position. Touch controls are off by half an inch, and there is no way to zoom in or out",

        "comment": "Start the app, receive a plea to click an ad, simulation starts with two small designs that crawl across the screen diagonally from upper right to lower left and wrap around. I stop it and hit random. Same designs, same locations, so I get the same results. Again and again I try and that is all it produces. Lame. I had to program an implementation of this in high school in 1993. It worked better than this (granted, just about any other implementation would, however). If only I knew how to program for Android... Uninstalling. There are much better (that is to say, working) implementations of this in the Play Store.",
