It was caused through a chain of circumstances. First the Vietnam War caused distrust and peaceful rebellion within the younger generations of Americans and Australians. In 1973 they brought the symbol and message to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin Australia. From there it became a household symbol around the world. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. It is incorporated into business logos or in business advertisements and listings in telephone books. It is also seen on clothing. Versions of this include an Ichthys with \"Jesus\" or \"ÎÎ§ÎÎ¥Î£\" in the center, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself.People might also search for this under God, Easter, Crucifixion, Jesus Christ Live Wallpaper, Jesus Live Wallpaper, Jesus Fish Live Wallpaper or Bible live wallpaper.This is built in celebration of peace and love around the globe.",
