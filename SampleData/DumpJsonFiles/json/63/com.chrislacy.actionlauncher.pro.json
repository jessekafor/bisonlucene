Also, the search function in the action bar is still borderline unusable.  It stalls and halts the phone as much as it ever did.  This is something basic that needs to be fixed if the developer is going to be asking 5 stars from his users.  This app has been vastly improved, but still has a way to go to get to Nova Launcher\\'s reliability.  Also, it still needs unread counts.  This is something that Nova and other launchers have had for over a year.",

I hope multiple docks are added, as well as more transition animations. Other suggestions: option to add contact search to the left homescreen sidebar. Option to have dock and action bar as overlays so that more home screen room can be used for widgets. Thanks dev, it\\'s great so far!!!",
