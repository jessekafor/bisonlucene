Categories will be automatically identified if its expense exceeds its budget. Any of your expenses can be tagged with tax codes/sections which help in filing taxes. Keep track of your expenses whether they are reimbursable or not and cloud integration for your data backup is available in future. Pictures of receipts can be saved along with their expenses. Xpense Manager is the smartest and friendly app at your service. Featuresâ¢\tYou can add new categories and sub categories which can be edited or removed later. However, you cannot edit or remove a default category in the app.â¢\tYou can assign a budget to your categories and sub categories every month.â¢\tOnce your actual expense exceeds the budget, that category will be highlighted.â¢\tApart from the categories and sub categories for tracking expenses, the Xpense manager provides you with an option to tag it with your tax codes/sections.
