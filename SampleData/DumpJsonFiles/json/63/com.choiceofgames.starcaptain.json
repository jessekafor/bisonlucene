    "description": "Fight on the front lines of the war between humanity and the hideous Blobs. (Not that anyone has actually seen a Blob up close, but everyone knows they have tentacles. Surely theyâre hideous!) Go on stealth missions, run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, \"aided\" by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer. Choice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.For example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do? A) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moonâs gravity well. B) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if heâs so smart. C) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moonâs surface instead of attempting a risky escape. D) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloydâs screen with a torque wrench. Humanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race? The choice is yours.",

I can\\'t quite express why I didn\\'t enjoy this one as much, I found it annoying that you are only given one scenario to use each chosen trait, [i.e. if your fitness is high you have one opportunity to shine, then that is it.] No disrespect to the writer, as I know they took the time to write out this storyline, but since I paid thought some constructive criticism couldn\\'t hurt.

        "comment": "I thoroughly enjoyed this app & would recommend it to anyone looking to recapture the feel of old gamebooks & CYOA novels. The story is well written, original, & very humorous. Compared to similar apps it has a far better standard of English (i.e. it has actually been proof-read & edited), provided an ample amount of content for the price tag, & had less scope to randomly kill the character requiring a restart. Linearity is its only (slight) fault.",

        "comment": "I would say that the strong points of this piece are its clever humor, good writing, interesting characters, and its length.  There\\'s plenty of laughable moments, but I never felt like it was too much.  The story was engaging, with well thought-out choices.  I am very much a fan of Loyd, it wouldn\\'t be the same game without him!  I\\'ve run into a few game-books that were disappointingly short, whereas this game was long enough to develop a good story.  The only big thing I have to say against it is this - the plot is very much linear.  Not that it is a bad thing, first time through, but it doesn\\'t make it very re-playable.    That being said, it is definitely worth the purchase, as a clever and well written piece of work.",

I understand that, most of the time, a choice in a game is pretty much an illusion of choice (a la The Walking Dead or even Mass Effect) but this game didn\\'t always do a great job of keeping up the illusion. The characters were interesting though, and I liked the various outcomes at the end. A good story that could\\'ve benefited from some extra options and more interactions with characters, and perhaps even a romance subplot.",
