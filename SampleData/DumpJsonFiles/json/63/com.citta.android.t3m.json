    "description": "The Three Musketeers Game is a new strategy game that is extremely simple to learn and play and yet very hard to master. You play by moving one of your figures either forwards or backwards one or more squares, but only up to the maximum allowed: The Musketeers and Guards can move up to 4 squares, while D'Artagnan and Rochefort can move up to 5 squares. The King and the Cardinal can only move one square at a time.The objective is to push the opponent's figures to the back line. When that happens the opponent cannot move and loses the game.It looks simple, but try to beat the computer, even at the Beginner level ... and then there is Advanced and Expert!To make sure that no side has an advantage, the side that goes first alternates with every new game.",
