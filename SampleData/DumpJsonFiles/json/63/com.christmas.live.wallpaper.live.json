It is a celebration of love, joy and unity; symbolized by familiar images that are designed to conjure up warm feelings of home, new beginnings and a giving spirit. It is celebrated on December 25th of each year - the day Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. There are many different customs and traditions around the world. What would the holiday be like without decorations, lights, caroling, and all the other symbols we've come to know and love? Let's mention some of them.\"The Christmas tree\" has become a prominent symbol of the holiday. It is an evergreen that is decorated with ornaments during the festive season. Poinsettias are now widespread as a beautiful holiday decoration. They are native to Mexico. Candy canes have been around for centuries, but it wasn't until around 1900 that they were decorated with red stripes and bent into the shape of a cane. They were sometimes handed out during church services to keep the children quiet.Santa Claus is a much beloved mythical figure appearing during the Yuletide season. He goes by several names including Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, Santa. He is the jolly old gift giver that comes during New Year's Eve to give children around the world toys of many kinds. No Xmas would be complete without the figure of Santa gracing greeting cards, shopping malls, decorative ornaments. His popularity remains intrinsic to the spirit of the holiday because of what he symbolizes, that is, the true spirit of giving. The traditional Yule Log is another popular symbol. While burning the log is restricted to places that have a built in fireplace, it is still a great custom that may be used to celebrate the holidays. Basically once the log is burning no work should be done. During this time friends, family and neighbors gather to sing, dance, listen to or tell stories, eat and partake in any activities that will allow them to enjoy the brief period of merriment as much as they can.Enjoy watching great pictures of these symbols on your new live wall paper any time.Ads information:=============This app is ad supported.
