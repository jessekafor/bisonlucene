It introduces way too many new characters, and locks a lot of potentially interesting information behind stat walls.   The political aspects of the game are disappointing - you can\\'t really change any of the events. In fact, that goes for the entire game in general - you can control what your character says to an extent but everything else is completely railroaded.",

That being said, the second installment completely disappointed me. The story is incredibly short, the characters have very little importance (or need to get to know them), and your choices just don\\'t impact the storyline. I felt like I was simply reading a novel (albeit short), not playing a CoG.  I\\'ve been waiting years for this. I even bought a Google Play card the day it came out so I could get this.  Not only do I regret the $3 I just spent, but I\\'m also worried about where Choice of Games intends to go from here.   Simply put, don\\'t waste your money. I\\'m only giving it two stars because of the amazing part one. :(",
