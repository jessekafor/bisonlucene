Roddenberry, Rick Berman, and Michael Piller served as executive producers at different times throughout the production. The show was created 21 years after the original Star Trek show.The show is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, approximately during the 2360s (about 100 years after the original series) and features a new crew and a new starship Enterprise. Patrick Stewart's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose, updated from the original to represent an open-ended \"mission\", and to be gender-neutral:    Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.It premiered the week of September 28, 1987, to 27 million viewers with the two-hour pilot \"Encounter at Farpoint\". With 178 episodes spread over seven seasons, it ran longer than any other Star Trek series, ending with the two-hour finale \"All Good Things...\" the week of May 23, 1994.The series was broadcast in first-run syndication with dates and times varying among individual television stations. The show gained a considerable following during its run and, like the original series, remains popular in syndicated reruns. Three additional Star Trek spin-offs followed The Next Generation: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993â1999), Star Trek: Voyager (1995â2001), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001â2005). The series formed the basis of the seventh to tenth Star Trek films, and is also the setting of numerous novels, comic books, and games.In its seventh season, Star Trek: The Next Generation became the first and only syndicated television show to be nominated for the Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Series. The show received numerous recognitions, including Emmy Awards, Hugo Awards, and a Peabody Award. The Next Generation made several publications' lists of the best television shows of all time.",
