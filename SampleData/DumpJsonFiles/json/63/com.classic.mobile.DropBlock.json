        "comment": "It would b a great game, considering I love tetris, however, once u get into playing it, (I.e. over lvl 2), the block r not in a straight line (computer glitch maybe) I dwnloaded it a couple times. Same thing. And there r invisible piecs I guess. Plus without proper instruction on all piecs, like what do u do with the bombs that pop up, cuz u can\\'t blowup anything that I could tell, then they disappear too. Anyway, its very hard to figure out this game and there\\'s something wrong with it.",
