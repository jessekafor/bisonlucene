I\\'d like to see a RESET button DURING the elapsing stopwatch time so I immediately can start another session without having to first hit STOP and then RESET.  I\\'d also like to see a lock screen feature.  One \\\"bug\\\" is that on the landscape view of the stopwatch the buttons disappear on at the bottom requiring I turn it back to landscape.
