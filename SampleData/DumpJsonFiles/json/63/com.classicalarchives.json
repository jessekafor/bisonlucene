        "comment": "I have been a member for 20+ years, going back to MHS, which this organization is an evolution of.  I have 1,000 CD\\'s, listen only to .WAV files, and have been listening to classical music since I was 17: I am now 60.   This app has changed my daily music listening experience.  For one week now, I have been listening three hours per day to Haydn masses and other sacred works.  And then another week for 1/2 of his string quartets!  Huge breadth of composition choices of great Western composers including great minor ones such as Henry Purcell.  AND you can choose  the conductor and performers for each composition!  Hopefully, the app in future will add tweaks.  It needs a menu and settings for functions such as \\\"clear queue.\\\"  The functions now are more or less intuitive but also hidden.  Nevertheless, this is such a robust app that I am giving it five stars.  There is so much music here, that I\\'ll be listening at least for a year, hours per day, to say nothing of repeating works.  Bravo ClassicalArchives!  Kurt Jensen",

        "comment": "I\\'ve been anticipating this app for years, and it\\'s a good start.  I\\'d like to see an album-oriented option as well. Perhaps selecting an album cover would display all its tracks and permit queuing any or all, as can be done with the PC application. Also, it would be nice if composer name searches did not require correct accent marks. (It took me a while to find Bartok.)",

        "comment": "This app allows to SELECT what work you want to listen to in this gigantic library! (So it\\'s not a radio!) Two main modes: In The Library mode, you can select the performance (album) of the work you want to listen to. To do this in The Library, either select The Greats for quick access to the really greatest composers, or you can search by composer name. In the Must Know mode, you are presented with the latest releases of the most important works. Again two methods: by the Must Know composers, or you can search for these \\\"must know\\\" works by Period and/or Genre (like Late-/Post-Romantic + Stage/Opera). The app\\'s Queuing Player is beautiful to look at and allows you to add many tracks, even complete works, to be played one after the other.    New! Now with playlists management! Cool!",
