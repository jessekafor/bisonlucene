However, male reindeers shed their antlers around Christmas, so the reindeer pulling Santaâs sleigh are likely not male, but female or castrati. Interesting, right? Also, Norwegian scientists have hypothesized that the red nose on one of the most famous reindeer, Rudolph, is probably the result of a parasitic infection of his respiratory system. Bet you didnât know that!The story of a traditional candy cane is a more amusing one. In a small Indiana town, there was a candy maker who wanted to spread the name of Jesus around the world. He invented the Holiday Candy Cane, incorporating symbols for the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus Christ. He began with a stick of pure white, hard candy to symbolize the Virgin Birth. The candy maker formed the stick into a âJâ to represent the name of Jesus. It can also represent the staff of the âGood Shepherd.â He thought the candy was too plain so he stained it with a red stripe to symbolize the bloodshed by Christ on the cross.Despite what you might think about Santa's ability to visit every good boy and girl's home in the world in one night (and if you're over the age of 10 and still scratching your head about it, you might want to evaluate your priorities), it's not as astronomical of a feat as you might think. Technically, he would have 34 hours to complete his task and his sleigh would only have to travel at 99.999999% of the speed of light assuming he only visits 800 million houses over the entire surface area of the Earth.However, with Christmas Magic Live Wallpaper, you donât have to think about either presents or candy â they are at the tip of your fingers!
