It also has a good break down of the areas or the different categories you can choose from to find what you are looking for or what is in the area you are in. The best part is that once downloaded you don\\'t have to usr internet to keep this app working which is good due to the spotty cell phone coverage in the park and mountains and such.",

        "comment": "After trying repeatedly to download the maps for offline use I\\'m pretty much ready to uninstall this app. My understanding is that cell/data coverage is sparse to non-existent in Yellowstone, so I wanted the maps for my upcoming trip. Unfortunately I\\'m not even sure how large the map files even are, I\\'m only guessing that the number given is in kb, making it about 80MB, no big deal. I finally decided to try downloading via 4G, figuring that\\'s faster than the wi-fi at home. It was moving any faster, so I gave up. The app used nearly 50MB of data, yet when I check the app settings, the app is only about 20MB, and the data files are less than 3MB. What was is downloading if it wasn\\'t the map files?  Absolutely worthless to me at this point, and I had such high hopes for it. Figured I would keep trying to download the maps since I have some time before my trip. It downloaded all night, and several hours into the day, and it keeps the screen on, but don\\'t dare turn it off or the download stops. It finally got to 59%. The network connection was lost, which meant that I had to go back in and try to download again. Where does it resume? 18%. Seriously, what\\'s with that.",

        "comment": "Lots of great information about Yellowstone park. The map can get quite detailed with contours and topo. The map allows you to filter what types of points you want to see (I turned off fishing, picnic areas, bicycling). There are a lot of geysers and other features listed, and you can click on them for more information and pictures. You can set them as favorites so you can find them again. It also lists trails, with descriptions.  The biggest problem, especially with Yellowstone, is the park is HUGE, the size of the state of Delaware. So there are 80,000 map tiles to store, covering all 7 different resolutions, down to being quite detailed. And it takes a *long* time for those to download. Worse, there is a function to download all of the maps, but it might only get 100 at a time before timing out (set your device not to sleep; you can get 1% in 30 minutes). After 3 days of playing around with it and trying numerous times to get everything, including scanning around at different zoom levels, I got up to 7% map coverage (covering most of the road). Then something happened and all the maps were lost. Sometimes only part was lost. 2 GB of data transfer over a week, all gone. Useless.",
