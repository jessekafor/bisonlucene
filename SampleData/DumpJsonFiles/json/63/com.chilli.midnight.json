    "description": "Mike Singleton's '84 classic Adventure Strategy game, brought to and updated for Android. \"The Lords of Midnight is not simply an adventure game nor simply a war game. It was really a new type that became known as an epic game, for as you play the Lords of Midnight you will be writing a new chapter in the history of the peoples of the Free. You will guide individual characters across the land of Midnight on vital quests but you will also command armies that must endeavour to hold back the foul hordes of Doomdark, the witch king. Yours will be no inevitable victory.\" - Mike Singleton 1984 I've tried to make this compatible with as many Android devices as possible without actually owning them all. Hopefully we won't have too many hiccups along the way! If you have any issues please please contact me through www.thelordsofmidnight.com/support so that I can work with you to resolve them.Reviews for the iOS version====================\"Lords of Midnight does story-based, large-scope, high-fantasy warfare better than most titles I can think of, iOS or otherwise.\" - Rating 4/5- PocketTactics.com \"This is an outstanding remake and developer Chris Wild, should feel very proud of creating such a superb celebration of the manâs work.\" - Rating 8/10 - Metro \"#1 - Top 5 iPhone and iPad games of the week\" - AppMyWorld.com \"If you're interested in classic games, especially fantasy and/or strategy games, Lords of Midnight is a must-have.\" - Rating 4/5 - TouchArcade.com \"App of the Year!\" - Rating 5/5, Mirror.co.uk \"It's an unmissable remake. Few titles weather the storms of time as well as this solid-gold classic.\" - Rating 4/5 - PocketGamer.co.uk \"A must own title; pure genius and extremely entertaining. Recommended.\" - Rating 98/100 - Arcade Life âMade of extremely bright colors and clean lines, a stylistic choice that was and still is very original.â â Multiplayer.it \"Despite the perfectly adapted touch controls and crisp graphic presentation, this is a proper 1980s they-donât-make-âem-like-they-used-to game\" - PocketTactics.com \"#3 - Top 10 iPad games and apps of December 2012\" - QualityIndex.com \"If you love a game, love the gameâs creator and want to produce an updated tribute â hereâs your benchmark. Almost thirty years old and yet it feels fresh, relevant and completely at home on a touch screen. Recommended without reservation â so good it makes me want to cry.\" - Arcade Life \"Original, longed for and a perfect adaptation of a legendary game. Unlike those Spectrum conversions that are strictly for nostalgia lovers, Chris Wildâs Lords of Midnight will enthrall any gamer who thinks he has what it takes for a true battle of wits where only the most brilliant commanders will survive.\" - Louise Mensch, Mirror.co.uk \"Lords of Midnight is an experience that everybody with a remote interest in games should have, buying into your characters and developing your own war stories is a wonderful thing. It is a game with hidden depths that deserve to be plumbed and I cannot recommend it enough.\" - KoruCottage.com iOS Best Port/Retro Gamer of the Year\" - Arcade Life Please check out www.thelordsofmidnight.com/blog for news on updates and new features to come...",

The stylish graphics look great, while retaining the iconic look of the original. The new features - especially the map and lord grouping - are welcome additions to the original game.

        "comment": "So glad I pushed the button on this, especially as it cost me less than the original! I am always wary of  \\\"tributes\\\", \\\"re workings\\\" etc, as generally they end up pants, and I am left with a slightly soiled feeling. This one has given me a blast of anti cynicism worthy of the term epiphany. Glorious graphics, touch screen loveliness and enough refining of the interface to truly feel like it is a build and enhancement of the original. I still get the same \\\"oh no\\\" moment when I see strange flags unexpectedly, and my old tried and tested techniques don\\'t work as well as I remember! And I no longer need a pencil and map! Huzzah - as the days of me bothering with that are long gone. Also impressive is the developer\\'s response to feedback and suggestions. I have waited a while before reviewing to judge this and its pleasing to see the way this is handled. A real labour of love, and the carefully crafted hand of a true fan is obvious throughout. Thank you - now where was that vengeful daughter again?",
