        "comment": "#1) This app is good for booking tee times, and is one of the most enjoyable ways to book. I love it.  I also like having the course yardage map handy, I find it nearly as useful as the GPS feature, which I only bother with occasionally because of item #2 below.  #2) Where the app falls down is in the EXTREMELY SMALL buttons. It is a 50/50 shot to push the microscopic GPS button and not get the audio walk-through instead.  #3) When using GPS, the App Crashes. A lot.  I stop and start the app many, many, MANY times during a round. I have a Samsung phone, maybe that is the problem?  #4) The App does not remember where you were when the App was last open. So when you\\'re on the 12th hole, every time you re-open the app you are at hole #1 again, and have to skip-skip-skip-... if the App is going to crash constantly, it needs to have the previous hole cached in memory.  #5) There is only one direction to page-through the course map, again, starting at #1 every time. Why no arrow allowing you to back through #18 on down? It\\'s the same interface, just put a button going the other way folks!",
