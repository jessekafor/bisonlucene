    "description": "Grocery Price Comparator is a light-weight, offline comparison tool to find out which item(s) of a given type of product would be the cheapest by calculating the price per quantity of the product. If your grocery store doesn't have a price per quantity (with some measurable quantity, like fluid ounces), you can use this application to store prices with optional labels to compare products and quickly calculate the best deal. Convert products with pesky measurement differences (gallons vs. quarts, grams vs. ounces, etc.) to find out your best option for saving money.If any bugs/crashes occur, please contact us by e-mail: support@chris2.net",
