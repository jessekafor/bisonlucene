    "description": "Chrome Tips Application provides you Tips and tricks to optimize your Chrome Browser by making optimal utilization of it setting options.Chrome Tips is tips and tricks to optimize Chrome Browser and is not a Chrome hacks application.What is Chrome BrowserGoogle Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google that uses the WebKit layout engine. It was released as a beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008. As of February 2013, according to StatCounter, Google Chrome has a 37% worldwide usage share of web browsers making it the most widely used web browser in the world. Net Applications, however, indicates that Chrome is only third when it comes to the size of its user base, behind Internet Explorer and Firefox.In September 2008, Google released the majority of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium, on which Chrome releases are still based.Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple and stable. There are extensive differences from its peers in Chrome's minimalistic user interface, which is atypical of modern web browsers.For example, Chrome does not render RSS feeds. One of Chrome's strengths is its application performance and JavaScript processing speed, both of which were independently verified by multiple websites to be the swiftest among the major browsers of its time. Many of Chrome's unique features had been previously announced by other browser developers, but Google was the first to implement and publicly release them. For example, its most prominent graphical user interface (GUI) innovation, the merging of the address bar and search bar (the Omnibox), was first announced by Mozilla in May 2008 as a planned feature for Firefox. Both Internet Explorer 9 and Safari (version 6) have since merged the search and address bar.No security vulnerabilities in Chrome had been successfully exploited in the three years of Pwn2Own from 200911.However, Chrome was the first browser to be defeated at Pwn2Own 2012, by a French team who used zero day exploits to take complete control of a fully patched 64-bit Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxingA study has shown that users are four times more likely to be tricked into downloading malware than be compromised by an exploit. A May 2011 study reported Chrome 10 blocked only 13% of malicious URLs, the same as Safari and Firefox, behind Internet Explorer 9 which blocked 92%, and 100% with application-based filtering enabled. Referring to that study, Ars Technica wrote in July 2011 that \"Even with the false positives, Microsoft's approach appears to be more secure.\" A February 2012 study reported that Chrome 15 had a 34.1% malware-blocking rate.Neither study analyzed exploits that install malware without the user being aware (for example clickjacking and drive-by downloads).Google introduced new security functionality  download scanning protection  in Chrome 17Keywords: Chrome Tips and Tricks, Optimize Chrome Browser, Best Browser for Mobile, Moble Browsers, Optmize Mobile Browser",
