        "comment": "Outlook has presented problems on every platform i\\'ve owrked with. You always have to put together non-perfect solutions to make it work. ClearSync has created one of the best calendar syncing solutions I have used. While it is not perfect. It is a really solid first version. I am VERY much looking forward to the outlook contact sync product. I think the company could do a little more work on the user interface and flow of the product. I hignly recomend it to anyone!",
