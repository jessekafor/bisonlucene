        "comment": "it needs to handle the ending of the timed games differently. An easy fix would at least be to move the buttons for saving and trying again somewhere else rather than right where you tap the answers, since in almost every game i end up trying to tap one of the answers when the time runs out and i tap the save or try again without seeing the score!",
