However, after contacting the developer with my problem, I was very impressed with the very prompt response and  he immediately worked on a fix for this. Well done.    Lesson learnt for me, though, is that it is a good idea to save anything important to another location, as things can sometimes go wrong.",

I really enjoy the transparency of the colored backgrounds, although some of the colors aren\\'t truly as described--e.g. \\\"light yellow\\\" is anything but that color.  Not docking a star for this, but hopeful that the dev will expand the app to allow for more accurate colors.  Definitely worth the price as it stands.  Runs beautifully on my phone, and the notes are highly visible even with 8 pt. font.",
