This quiz will not only test your knowledge, but teach you about the respected apostles and prophets we follow.Too often they are just a name or a face, let's put the names and faces together and learn about their teachings and examples.There are two groups to be quizzed on. Either select to be quizzed on current (living) apostles by selecting the apostles tab, or select the prophet mode and you will be quizzed on presidents of the church. There is also a study mode which will list all the current apostles along with their names followed by all the latter day prophets or presidents of the church. There are also multiple levels to each group. Face to the Name - the original. Pick the right apostle/prophet from 4 images (multiple choice) when given a name.Last Conference - the latest (or last) General Conference message.
