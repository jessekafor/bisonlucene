The first decorated bush was in Riga, Latvia in 1510. Besides evergreens, other types of trees such as cherry and hawthorns were used for decoration in the past. Using small candles as ornaments dates back to the middle of the 17th century. Thomas Edison's assistant, Edward Johnson, came up with the idea of electric lights for decoration in 1882. They were first mass-produces in 1890.Artificial firs were developed in Germany during the 19th century and later became popular in the United States. These were made using goose feathers that were dyed green and attached to wire branches. The wire branches were then wrapped around a central rod that acted as a trunk. Today, most artificial evergreens are made from PVC plastic. They are fire-retardant, but not fire-resistant.Some of the studies have shown that firs remove dust and pollen from the air.221-foot Douglas fir that was displayed in 1950 at the Northgate Shopping Center in Seattle, Washington was the largest evergreen ever cut and used for decoration.The traditional three colors of Christmas are green, red and gold. Green has long been a symbol of life and rebirth; red symbolizes the blood of Christ, and gold represents light, as well as wealth and royalty.Another fun fact is about mistletoe â it comes from the Anglo-Saxon word misteltan, which means âlittle dung twigâ because the plant spreads though bird droppings. Ancient peoples, such as the Druids, considered mistletoe sacred because it remains green and bears fruit during the winter when all other plants appear to die. Druids would cut the plant with golden sickles and never let it touch the ground. They thought it had the power to cure infertility and nervous diseases and to ward off evil.Download Christmas Tree Live Wallpaper and enjoy the beauty of âChristmas holidaysâ right now!Ads information:=============You may also get notifications and shortcut icons about similar free and sponsored apps.
