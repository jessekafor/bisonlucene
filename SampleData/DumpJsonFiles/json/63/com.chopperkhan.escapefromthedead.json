        "comment": "Yes, the game is short but quality is not sacrificed. This point and click adventure is intriguing and challenging enough to justify a 5 star rating.The $1.00 spent is well worth it. I have spent a lot more on games only to be extremely disappointed. I can\\'t wait for the next chapter and will have qualms about purchasing it. Great Job DIGI-CHAIN GAMES.",
