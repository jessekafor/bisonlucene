    "description": "Artemis is a digital director's viewfinder designed for cinematographers, directors, and anyone interested in filmmaking, photography, cameras, and film. Artemis works in much the same way as a traditional director's viewfinder but more accurately and with many more features.If you have any issues please email us anytime for support. We are very happy to help!android@chemicalwedding.tvBy selecting your camera, an aspect ratio and a list of lenses, Artemis allows you to compose shots with the same field of view as the camera/lenses you will be shooting with. You can then save images, complete with focal length, GPS data, compass heading, tilt and roll, date and time, camera/lens information, and much more. A great tool for any level of filmmaker, Artemis is perfect for location scouting, storyboarding, blocking, rehearsal and preproduction.For lenses wider than the your devices camera's field of view, Artemis adds \"padding\" on the screen. While this is not ideal, it's our best solution for getting around the limitations of the camera in your device.Artemis has been field tested with every camera in our database to make sure that the field of view is correct. No other multiformat director's viewfinder has as many camera specific formats or lens sets.Please note that field of view is measured from the \"nodal point\", roughly mid way down the length of the lens, in keeping with the method used by lens manufacturers. ***Major update coming soon! With new user interface, custom camera calibration, custom lenses, and many other new useful features!***Camera Formats Include:-Film-35mm Film Standard, Super & Anamorphic16mm Film Standard, Super & 1.3 Anamorphic8mm Film Standard, Super, 1.36 & 1.44 65mm Film-35mm Digital-ARRI Alexa, Alexa Plus, Studio, D-21RED One, Red Epic, ScarletSony F35, F3, F65, NEX-10Panavision GenesisDigital StillsCanon 1D, 5DMkII & 7D, C300Nikon D seiresPentax series-High Speed Digital-Phantom HD, 7.3, 710, 9.0, 10,  FlexWeisscam HS-1,2-2/3\" Digital-Thompson ViperVaricamSI 2KSony F23Sony SRW-9000-1/2\" Digital- Sony EX3 & EX1-1/3\" Digital-Panasonic HVX200Sony HDR-FX1, HDR-Z1U*Also you can add any Custom Camera manually*Lens Sets Included:Generic 35mm & 16mm LensesCooke PanchroCooke S4/iCooke S5/iPanavision PrimoPanavision Primo DigitalPanavision System 65Zeiss Master PrimesZeiss StandardZeiss Super SpeedZeiss Ultra PrimesZeiss DigiPrimesZeiss SLR LensesZeiss/Arriflex 65mm primesZeiss Compact PrimesLeica Summilux-CElite S series Mk1vHawk V-Lite 1.3x AnamorphicsRed ProCanon HD-ECCanon EF CompatibleFujinon E-SeriesGeneric DSLR LensesBausch & Lomb Super BalterSchneider Cine-Xenar MkIINikon Dx & Fx CompatibleAnd many others...If your camera format or desired lens set isn't included or you believe a camera format isn't working for you, we include a custom camera feature that allows you to configure Artemis to any camera system.
