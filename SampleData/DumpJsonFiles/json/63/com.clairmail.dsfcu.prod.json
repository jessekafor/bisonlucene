        "comment": "I\\'ve been using the app for several months now and find it useful and simple to navigate. It would be useful if other Desert Schools\\' member accounts that are linked with my accounts could receive transfers as on the website. The  app only allows transfers betwee my own accounts. Also, the deposit feature is buggy; as soon as I take a picture of my check, the app completely closes and returns me to my phone\\'s home screen as if I exited the app myself. It has done this consistently. Fix please!",

        "comment": "The app in itself is solid and does everything I need it to from a mobile banking standpoint. Check balances and transfer money. I do not use the deposit function so I can not comment on that. This app desperately needs to be updated with a whole new UI though, this looks terrible and just in general offers a very low quality experience to the user and makes it seem like DS does not care about this app. Google\\'s new Holo UI is amazing and this seriously needs to be updated with the current guidelines. Please look into this.",
