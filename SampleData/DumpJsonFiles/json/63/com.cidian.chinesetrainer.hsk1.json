Without properly learning the correct tones, it changes the meaning of the word. Therefore it is critical to fix th end volume within the program. Please allow an adjustable volume within the program.  Thanks.",

        "comment": "A couple words omit pinyin in multiple choice mode (e.g. Daughter in hsk1). Sometimes 2 identical answers are listed as multiple choice options. It would help me if I could reverse multiple choice-i.e. show the English word and 4 mandarin multiple choice answers. Also, I wish the multiple choice would be more similar, e.g. 4 particles or 4 multipart words. Also, I wish the multiple choice answers would only draw from the pool of words in the set. These are all minor/moderate quibbles & this app is great.",
