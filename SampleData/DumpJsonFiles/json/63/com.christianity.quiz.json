It is significantly larger than the second largest: Islam. About one third of the world's population currently identifies themselves as Christian.Christianity is the largest in the U.S. and Canada, with profoundly deep influences on American and Canadian culture and politics. The sacred text is the Bible. Christians believe in Jesus Christ and follow his teachings. They believe Jesus is Godâs own son, sent by God to become human. In particular, conservative Christians provide the main opposition to freer abortion access; equal rights for gays and  lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, including the right for same-sex couples to marry etc. Countries with the largest number of Christians are the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and Russia. It appears that there are thousands of Christian churches. There seems to be a church on every other street corner in city after city.Some studies say that Brazil has twice as many Roman Catholics as Italy, while Nigeria has double the number of Protestants as Germany, where the Protestant Reformation began. About 50% of persons who identify themselves as Christians are Roman Catholics.Many people regard their own denomination or faith group within their own religion to possess the totality of religious truth; they view other denominations as teaching at least some error. Other people go further, and consider others to be in serious error and sometimes to be in opposition to the truth. Within fundamentalist and other evangelical Christianity denominations, others are sometimes referred to as being led by Satan or some of his demons.According to the membership, second place takes Islam but third is Hinduism. Persons with no formal, organized religion include Agnostics, Atheists, Deists etc. Their numbers are growing in Europe, North America, and other places. With the collapse of Communism in the USSR, the total numbers worldwide dropped precipitously and are now increasing.  There is no consensus on the number of Buddhists in the worlds.  There is no consensus on the data of founding of Judaism as well. Some claim that Adam and Eve were the first Jews, and lived circa 4000 BCE; others suggest that they and all biblical persons prior to King David are mythical; they never existed. Some would place the date at the time of Abraham, circa 1900 BCE. Many, perhaps most, followers of Chinese folk religion follow a number of different philosophies including Taoism. The number cited for Taoism is an estimate of the number of individuals who follow only Taoism.Ads information:=============This app is free and ad supported.
