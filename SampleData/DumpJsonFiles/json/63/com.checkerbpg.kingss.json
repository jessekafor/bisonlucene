    "description": "Author Steve Broomeâs story of what happens when the world's only superhero dies, and its population tries to fill the void with science. After a devastating tsunami, the body of a supernatural being is found. Questions among the population fly: Who was he? Are there more of them? And, what kind of technology do they possess? This prompts a bidding war among superpowers to acquire the body in order to run scientific tests on it, but the results of the tests could uncover a government conspiracy and jeopardize the lives of everyone.",
