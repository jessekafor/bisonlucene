        "comment": "This app has a lot of helpful information displayed in an easy-to-use format. Hikes are sortable by time, distance, difficulty, or height of climb. The map is detailed and interactive, and the shuttle schedule gives you the time of the next bus and even tips if you miss the last one with your bike. It is very helpful, but has a few bugs - the app asks you each time to download \\\"AirMail\\\" to use the notifications, but that app is no longer available - just disable notifications in the settings window.   Also, when first downloaded, it stores the images, audio files, and maps offline - this is over a 100MB download, which would kill a cell phone battery if not on wifi - it takes a while to download (in the background), and it should give you the option to download it or not for those on a 3G connection...",
