It fully works with both the built in Music app & the Google Play Music app. After using Album Art Grabber, you just have to select your preferred music app from the \\\"manage apps\\\" on your phones main menu and clear the data then run the music app and it will read your music library and every cover art will be applied! Great app! I highly recommend this app to anyone who can\\'t get their music album art to work initially.",
