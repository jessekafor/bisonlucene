I get its supposed to be end-of-the-game-highstakes kind of thing, but maybe we should have three tries instead of one. Or just tell ME how to prove him wrong and I\\'ll be content.",

The only thing was that in the end if you don\\'t guess the right inconsistency in the killer\\'s story the murder is ruled as suicide and you have to start ALL OVER AGAIN if you want to complete the whole thing. I played this 7 times to get the whole ending; you should be glad I had so much patience. Of course taking notes is also an option but that is also very tedious. Please make it in the end you get more chances to guess so people don\\'t die of frustration, ;D thanks.",
