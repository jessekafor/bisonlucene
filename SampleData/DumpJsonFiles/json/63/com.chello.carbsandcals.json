Don\\'t waste the money, this app will help you loose four pounds but it won\\'t be in weight.",

I\\'ve only downloaded it today but I\\'ve noticed a fouple of things not working as they should. Firstly the feature where you take a photo of the food you are adding is not working.  It takes the picture but does not save it. Also in the diary, where it keeps track of your daily carbs, it seems to add 1 carb on top of your daily amount so is inaccurate, but this is just a minor quibble. If these issues are fixed as well as the database updated with more branded items and takeaways, it will be a 5 star app for me.",

        "comment": "I know fellow diabetics that rave about the book, but I didn\\'t want to carry around in my ever increasing bag so thought this app would be an awesome idea.  Previously I only used free apps and am used to them having blips etc but assumed that was because they were free.  From this it seems paid ones are no more reliable or professional.  The \\'download all pictures\\' option only seems to download 1/3 of pics despite there being plenty of space on my phone and card.  This means eating out in areas of poor signal you spend so much time waiting for photos to download to gauge your portion size that the meal is cold before you get to eat it!  It also eats your data usage, and battery life.  My phone won\\'t last a full day without charging now if used at every mealtime - nothing worse than thinking you have the tool in your handbag but when you get your meal out you can\\'t use tool as either no battery or signal!  The variety of meals/foods I thought would be larger than the DAFNE app but I still find it lacking and can only work out half of my meals from it - and I don\\'t eat unusual things!  Would stick to book if you want the portion sizes photos, otherwise download DAFNE",

        "comment": "I have type 1 Diabetes, and this can be helpful out and about. Sadly, the app is let down. Search is not very good, a search for \\\"Honey\\\" will bring up many results before actual Honey appears. The UI is out of date and, I\\'m going to be a little blunt here, looks ugly. Custom foods is a good feature, but I feel it could be better implemented, I shouldn\\'t have to know the specific weight of food. Adding images to custom foods does not work. Downloading all images hangs at around 35/36mb.  Needs fixing.",

        "comment": "This is an excellent app but its 2 biggest drawbacks are A) When you add your own food to compliment the vast range that is already there you can take a photos of the the food you want to add BUT the photo doesn\\'t show up on Android phones so all you get is a question Mark. It appears to work fine on Iphones B) No Exports to Excel, CSV etc. bad move. Is it worth \\302\\2434 for the android version? Absolutely not. If the photo display issue is fixed then yes but it should be a free app on Android. \\\"On Track\\\" is a good free app and is on a par with Carbs&Cals (unless C&C can get the photo issues sorted and then it\\'ll be 5 stars plus",
