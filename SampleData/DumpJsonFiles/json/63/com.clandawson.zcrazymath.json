    "description": "I first wrote this application for my Android phone when my kids came home in 1st grade, and had to practice Rocket Math.  It has been reasonably well tested on 2.3.3.  Rocket math is something used in Arizona schools to drive home basic math facts in primary school kids.Since then the school has decided to switch to a more traditional way of teaching kids math (that I don't really agree with) but essentially they get drilled on 1+1, 1+2, 1+3 etc.  As of August, 2012 the application has been expanded to practice that too!The game itself is actually 5 games checking the 4 basic operators, +-*/, and a final game checking all operators together.  Each \"game\" has 10 levels, starting with 123, and ending with all numbers 0-9. At it's most basic level, the game checks addition of the numbers 123 (1+1, 1+2 etc).The object of the game is to answer 25 questions within 60 seconds.  When that point is reached, the text on the numbers for that level will turn \"Green\" indicating that the level has been completed.How to play:When opening the game, select a user (Add a user) and then hit \"Play\"Game Choice:- Select the operator you want, then hit the numbers you want to practice / play  + On this screen, the numbers will turn \"green\" when you have successfully finished the operator / number combination within 60 secondsPlay Game Screen:- The top half just shows the game you are playing- The lower half of the screen is where you answer questions  + If you don't answer within 5 seconds, an orange \"Hint\" appears.  The point is to teach kids the answers, not make them suffer.  They still have to type in the answer, so hopefully they learn.Hitting back will always take you one step backwards",
