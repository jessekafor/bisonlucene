If we approve the check, it will be loaded on your VISA prepaid card in minutes for a reasonable fee.  Once Ingo loads the money from an approved check, itâs yours to spend - Ingo will never reverse the load, even if the check is bad.  How great is that? Ingo can review any type of check for approval up to $2,500, whether itâs from your employer, your neighbor, your customer, the seventeen parents in your childâs class at school, or even your Great Aunt June.

Then finally said the check is too old.  It is a 14 day old payroll check.  I called customer service and they say checks cannot be more than 5 days old.  What BS\\'!!!!!  Don\\'t use this it is not worth the aggravation.",

There are no set amounts on what they take from your check, it seems the less the check the more they take, doesnt make sense! I had loaded a $600 check and they took $7, then i tried a a $300 they wanted $17 then i had one for $400 they wanted $12. Now its telling my im not logged in or gps issues! Ill just go to the bank, they charge less!! App sucks!!!",

They were incredibly helpful and directed me to the people who could help me figure out what was wrong. Turns out there was an issue with the image processing and they were able to pinpoint and fix the issue. Then I had an issue with the load going onto my card, which turns out was the CARD companys issue, not Ingos, but they worked with me to get my card company to fix the problem, and touched base with me several times throughout to make sure I was getting help and answers. Friday I was able to load my paycheck FLAWLESSLY and in less then 5 minutes. They even called me after to make sure everything went OK and that I was happy. Some bumps in the road since downloading, but the A+++ customer service more then made up for it - and now the app works PERFECT for me! Thanks :-)",
