The latest AI update has really spoiled the party. I now struggle to win whereas before I could often win in 10 seconds. It\\'s a shame I can\\'t play the new one as a different game because I feel I have lost the old game I fell in love with. I am not certain but feel like AI is cheating now. Would be 5 if I had option to toggle between old school and new versions.",

At first I thought this game was a bit too fast and hard after about 10 games. Now I am ranked #16 on the 300-500 ladder. It\\'s just awesome. Challenging, but doable. I did not like the point system from the start, but now when I am (almost) mastering the game, I appreciate it. I love the balance between simplicity and challenge. There is only one game element, still, endless fun.",
