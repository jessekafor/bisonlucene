    "description": "Classic Snake 3 is a completly new Snake type game which base on experience and user feedback from Classic Snake 1997 and Classic Snake 2, earlier versions of this game that earned a great success.Classic Snake 3 new features:- Labirynth Mode- New skins- Main menu- Resetting best scoresClassic Snake 3 isn't only new version of Classic Snake 2, it is a completly new application and our main targets were improving funcionality of classic Snake game mode and searching possibilities for making gameplay more playable.We've reached that effect by developing completly new game mode which we named Labirynth Mode. Earlier on choosing a labirynth was possible only from dedicated menu. Now we improved it and develop  funcionality which finally came as a Labirynth Mode.Labirynths are making completly new Snake game type and by passing levels game is now getting harder and harder because of labirynths which you have to steer your snake. Finally can also be not so easy.We didn't forgot about Classic Mode game type, which Classic Snake is famous of. It has been improved, we added new skins which reminds classic mobile phones from years. New funcionality is resetting best scores, completly independent from game mode, which now is possible from settings menu.New Classic Snake 3 was developed as a independent platform, which we will be improving by next few months to increase number of players that are using Classic Snake game family. We've already reach over a milion users!",
