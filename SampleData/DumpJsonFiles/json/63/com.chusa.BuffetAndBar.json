    "description": "Buffet And Bar Wallpapers and Theme ApplicationA buffet is a system of serving meals in which food is placed in a public area where the diners generally serve themselves. Buffets are offered at various places including hotels and many social events. Buffets usually have some hot dishes, so the term \"cold buffet\" has been developed. A bar is a retail business establishment that serves alcoholic drinks â beer, wine, liquor, and cocktails â for consumption on the premises. Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, go-go dancers, or strippers. Bars which offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as music bars or nightclubs.",
