        "comment": "I wanted to be able to read aloud textual content that I\\'m working on when I\\'m reviewing my work. This provides a really simple way to selectively do so. I installed Ivona TTS, since the engine that comes with my Nexus 7 doesn\\'t seem to work with this app. I like that the basic user interface allows you to turn clipboard reading on and off, because I wouldn\\'t want this happening all the time.",
