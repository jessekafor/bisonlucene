It is frustrating, the constant restarting and rereading the same story over and over again. Ending is slightly anticlimatic but still worth playing. Not as good as others in the series. Also how is an Irishman outside the walls of Christian society?",

Being very intersted in dreams and psychology my self, it really struck a cord with me. However because of how short this game is and the fact that you often have to completely restart the game after mistakes, I can not give it a 5 star rating",

Minus 2 for the constant replaying and retrying with some of the answers.",
