        "comment": "It really needs to sync with some external source - google calendar for example.  This is the only program I\\'ve found that puts task and events on one calendar.  Since tasks do take time, and don\\'t seem to get done if they are not scheduled, this is the most important feature to me.  But as I work at my desk I like to see a blown of version of my day - either on screen or printed out.  So the inability to sync is a real drawback for me.  When does the google sync that is \\\"coming\\\" going to go live?",

        "comment": "Earlier today I said it crashed when trying to set a recurring event. Hours later the developer released a patch, and now I CAN set a recurring event without crashing it. Now my only small issue is that when I set a recurring event, it only repeats on the same day of the week, so to set a daily recurring event, you have to create it for each day. I can live with that, but it would be nice to be able to specify the days of the week it should recur. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Best UI for a task manager/calendar. Very easy to use and no unnecessary fluff. It was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately whenever I set up a recurring event, it crashes. I tried creating it first as a task, then as an event. Either way, once you check the recurring box, it crashes. Even rebooted the phone to make sure. Fix that problem and this is a definite 5 star app.  Samsung Galaxy Nexus ICS",
