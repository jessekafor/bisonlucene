Musicians Recorder allows you to record any single audio input over any background music.Great to record vocals over existing background or accompany tracks using your devices built in microphone.What makes Musicians Recorder unique is its ability to accept any audio input source. With a custom cable you can now plug your keyboard, guitar, external mic, or any other audio input into your device for recording.Musicians Recorder even has a Monitor feature that allows you to monitor your input signal in real time through your headphones! Works best with a phones hands free headset with a built in mic. Awesome for recording on the go this way!Note: the Monitor feature is better suited, and has less delay with Android 4.1+",

        "comment": "This doesn\\'t deserve any stars! This is the WORST app I\\'ve downloaded and used EVER!!! And when you listen to your voice while recording, I havs to take my earbuds out and turn off that feature because it echos after your voice and completely distracts you from your singing. DON\\'T EVER INSTALL!!!",
