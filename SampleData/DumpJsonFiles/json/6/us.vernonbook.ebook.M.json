    "description": "MORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.1 - GLASS HOUSES, THEFrom the author of the popular Weather Warden series. Welcome to Morganville, Texas. Just don't stay out after dark. College freshman Claire Danvers has had enough of her nightmarish dorm situation, where the popular girls never let her forget just where she ranks in the school's social scene: somewhere less than zero. When Claire heads off-campus, the imposing old house where she finds a room may not be much better. Her new roommates don't show many signs of life. But they'll have Claire's back when the town's deepest secrets come crawling out, hungry for fresh blood.MORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.2 - The Dead Girls' DanceClaire has her share of challenges. Like being a genius in a school that favors beauty over brains; homicidal girls in her dorm, and finding out that her college town is overrun with the living dead. On the up side, she has a new boyfriend with a vampire-hunting dad. But when a local fraternity throws the Dead Girls' Dance, hell is really going to break loose.MORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.3 - Midnight AlleyClaire Danvers's college town may be run by vampires but a truce between the living and the dead made things relatively safe. For a while. Now people are turning up dead, a psycho is stalking her, and an ancient bloodsucker has proposed private mentoring. To what end, Claire will find out. And it's giving night school a whole new meaning.MORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.4 - Feast of FoolsMORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.4 - Lord of MisruleMORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.6 - Carpe CorpusMORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.7 - Fade OutMORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.8 - Kiss of DeathMORGANVILLE VAMPIRES, V.9 - Ghost Town",
