        "comment": "First of all in order to get some money you should give at least 3 days trial so people see if its worth it. Second of all it force closes a lot, so fix it. And third of all if it doesn\\'t come with arguments about picks this app is zero.  So fix all these and then expect people to buy it. Untill then, to other people interested in this kind of apps I recommend Bet2Win. I bought them all and they\\'re worth every cent!",
