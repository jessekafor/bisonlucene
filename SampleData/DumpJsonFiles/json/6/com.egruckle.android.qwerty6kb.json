    "description": "Qwerty6 Keyboard (Q6KB) is the familiar qwerty keyboard with a twist. It puts all the letters in the familiar qwerty order, but it has just 15 big letter keys. Each key tells you how to type its letters:> To type the large letter, touch the key.> To type the upper letter, swipe up.> To type the lower letter, swipe down.It's a little easier to touch than to swipe, so the designer took the letter frequency of the English alphabet into account when deciding which letters you type by touching & which you swipe. Look at the QWE key. We use E 5 times more often than W & 130 times more often than Q, so E became the touch letter. With the help of 10 digits & a few punctuation marks to stretch things out, 15 of the 16 most-used letters became touch letters. So you touch 88% of the time & swipe only 12%.Some of the coding of this app is based on the SlideType keyboard by Alejandro Grijalba (in the Market). Q6KB uses the QwertyX Keyboard Design (copyright Â© 2011 by Ernest Ruckle). ATTENTION DEVELOPERSWould you like to use the QwertyX Keyboard Design in your own keyboard app? It's free for free apps. Contact us.SAFETYThere is no safer app than Q6KB. For proof, click the PERMISSIONS tab. The warning you'll see when activating Q6KB is the same for all keyboard apps. Only word prediction keyboards collect your personal information.WANT EVEN BIGGER KEYS?There are 3 keyboard apps based on the QwertyX design:> Qwerty4 Keyboard - For small phones, 4 keys wide, swipe 29% of the time, very large keys suitable for people with bad vision.> Qwerty5 Keyboard - For mid-size phones, 5 keys wide, swipe 17% of the time.> Qwerty6 Keyboard - For large phones, 6 keys wide, swipe 12% of the time.--------------------------U S E R - G U I D E--------------------------TO ACTIVATEIn settings, depending on Android version, go to Locale & text, Language & keyboard, or Language & input.

Notice the location of the numbers & these characters: !?@\"()&',.HOW TO SWIPETo type a Q, put your thumb on the middle of the QWE key & immediately move it towards the top of the phone. Lift your thumb when you've moved it about the height of the key. Swipe down for the W. A short, quick swipe is best.SPECIAL KEYSTo activate one of the narrow keys (Shift, Delete), don't try to touch the middle of the key. Touch the border between the key & the edge of the screen.> Shift key - Touch to toggle shift mode. Swipe up to toggle numbers & symbols.

Hold down for more punctuation marks.> Delete key - The only key that repeats if you hold it down.POP-UP CHARACTERSWhen you long-press most of the keys, a small pop-up keyboard will appear. The letter keys have accented letters for Spanish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Maltese, & more. The 0H& key has Spanish punctuation. The Space & R keys have extra English punctuation.The M key has math & currency symbols. The number keys have symbols related to the characters on the key.
