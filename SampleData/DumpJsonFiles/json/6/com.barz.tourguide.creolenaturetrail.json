    "description": "Welcome to your personal tour of Louisianaâs Creole Nature Trail All-American Road! From your vehicle, the wild and ruggedly beautiful wetlands of the Creole Nature Trail appear peaceful and tranquil, but donât be fooled. Known as Louisianaâs Outback, this fertile world where land and water merge is teeming with life and activity. In fact, the area supports 28 species of mammals, more than 300 species of birds and 132 species of fish, not to mention the largest American Alligator population in the United States. From Lake Charles to the Gulf of Mexico, the Creole Nature Trail traverses more than 180 miles (including four wildlife refuges) in Southwest Louisiana. Outdoor adventures are the top draw, naturally. Oak cheniers and world-class bird and alligator populations are a natural wonder. Top-notch fishing, hunting, crabbing, boating, nature photography and other outdoor opportunities distinguish the Creole Nature Trail as a recreational paradise for all ages.Through both audio and video content, the Creole Nature Trail is designed to bring to life this vast wilderness area. The hardy and extremely resilient people who choose to live in these wetlands. The wildlife, both land and aquatic, who thrive in this unique ecosystem, ultimately providing valuable food for the entire United States. The vast mineral resources and the underground pipeline systems which bring energy to the nation. And the almost yearly impact of hurricanes on a disappearing coastline. For your ease and safety, the Creole Nature Trail Tour Experience is automatically activated based on your GPS coordinates regardless of whether you are driving or strolling out into the marshlands at several handicap accessible boardwalks.Come on, experience Louisianaâs Outback via your own personal guide. Or, as we in south Louisiana like to say, Laissez les bon temps rouler! (Let the good times roll!)",

How could the beggar Stir when the spider with diamonds Had chained him thus? What a feast, What an orgy of color is here Spilt into a beggar\\'s eye! Look! A fountain turned upsidedown Spraying comets and crystals on the world! A garden In the sky filled with giant Roses that open and close As the sky breathes! Here he Lies...Drunk with the evening...FROM J.M. CHAPESKIE",
