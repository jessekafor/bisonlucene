Now, if there was a way to integrate savings goals and reports into the app and make it more useful, more so than functional it would deserve five stars. For my troubles, ill give it 3.",

Do wish I knew last week when I was out of state in Washington state as I only made it to a branch because I drove by one & did not know I would be near one. I was glad because I did not want to carry such a large check for a long time with no good way to secure it.",
