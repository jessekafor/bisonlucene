    "description": "My Summer Vacation, Everything that I did during the greatest summer ever!This is a total fake book! The content pages of this book are totally blank. There is nothing on them. Because ... as the punch line page shows, Yep, that's right, I did absoluetly nothing! Prank anyone into thinking this is a real book and watch their reaction as they change blank page after blank page. It is totally hilarious â¦ This blank book has 2 blank pages. If you want to have more blank pages, then check out the Fake Book Builder application where you can build your own fake books.>> Other Fake Book Pranks:+ Men On Women+ Women on Men+ Teen Mind+ College and Me+ Back to SchoolIf you have any issues, please send us an email fakebooklibrary@gmail.com.
