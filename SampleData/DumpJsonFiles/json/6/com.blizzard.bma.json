        "comment": "I don\\'t know which ridiculous policies Blizzard follows, but it is impossible to get your account back once you lose access to the authenticator. First: you can\\'t even create a ticket without an account. And once you manage to do so anyway, they ask you for a scan of an ID. And because you can\\'t respond to that ticket, you have to create another one, just to find out that all of your three IDs are not \\'nationally accepted\\' (not even an European passport). They don\\'t even state why, and of course to ask you have to create a new ticket.",
