    "description": "A collection of 41 Headings you can use to organize your homescreens. Each Heading comes with two hotspots (1 over the text and 2 over the icon) and the line & text colour can be changed (See pictures)You MUST have UCCW 2.1.2 or higher installed on your device or this skin WILL NOT work.GMAIL HEADING OVERLAP ISSUE - SETUP GMAIL ACCOUNT FIRST - When you place the widget on your homescreen, tap on Hotspot 1 or 2, to open the UCCW Editor. Scroll down until you see Gmail 1 and tap on 'set gmail account' Select which account you wish to use and which label.....inbox, all mail etc etc then press the home or back button to return to the homescreen****This skin will only appear in UCCW after you place a widget on your homescreen. It does not appear in your app drawer or if you open UCCW from your app drawer****Two Hotspots available1. Open UCCW Editor2. Open UCCW EditorEach Hotspot can be assigned to a different app/shortcutAdding skin to your homescreen1. Add a 4x1 or 5x1 UCCW widget to your homescreen by long pressing the homescreen or browsing widgets in app drawer2. Select one of the Headings from UCCW menu3. Resize before hitting \"Touch Here\" (This is so that the Hotspots will be correctly aligned)4. Hit \"Touch Here\" to load the skin ****I would recommend, if you are using Nova or Apex or any other Launcher which supports Margins, to disable the vertical margins so the heading widgets reach the very edge of the screen (See pictures)****If you have any problems or queries please do not hesitate to email meEnjoy and thank you :o)",

        "comment": "This skin definitely completes the look that I\\'ve wanted for my N4. Any chance of making a heading for \\\"Shopping\\\" or \\\"Stores\\\"? I use a bunch of apps for shopping such as Amazon, eBay, and Slickdeals and it would be really nice to have a heading to represent those types of apps. Thank you. Update: Wow, that was quick, Dev. Thank you for responding to my request.",

        "comment": "I\\'ve always loved the minimal themes and I typically go as minimal as pure B&W, so the moment I stumbled across \\\"Headings\\\" I loved what I saw. I see from the reviews how attentive the Dev has been by meeting so many requests, and I do have one myself. I would like to see a YouTube heading and possibly a Pocketcasts heading. Even heading that says Podcasts would work well and probably accommodate other users for varying podcast apps. Thank You Dev!",

Had a couple of other ideas for headings but I can\\'t remember them right now, I need to take notes of stuff like this :p Thanks Mr. Dev ;)  Edit: remembered one of the other headings I wanted to request, an \\\"internet\\\" heading, for browsers/flipboard/twitter/etc. Also, thanks for the reply :)",
