    "description": "Vintage Spouse Test is a modern delivery of \"Tests for Husbands and Wives\", originally published by Dr. George W. Crane in 1939.  It's an amusing and illustrative glimpse of the \"chief merits and demerits\" of spouses as reported by the 600 participants Dr. Crane interviewed.  Each merit or demerit has a point value, and the grading scale minces no words:  scoring less than 24 points is FAILURE!The original test was highlighed on tech/geek/maker blog Boing Boing:  http://boingboing.net/2011/02/16/spousal-irritation-c.htmlAll 100 original questions - 50 for each spouse - and the original points and grading scale are in this simple and free Android app.  Some questions are hopelessly outdated (wives lose 5 points for wearing red nail polish!) while others are timeless and completely applicable today.Please enjoy this amusing and illustrating glimpse into the not-all-that-distant past.",
