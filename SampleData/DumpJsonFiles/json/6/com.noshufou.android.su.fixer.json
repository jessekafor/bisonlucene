    "description": "** Requires root **This app is designed to fix update problems that come from mismatched signatures between Superuser.apk on your phone, and Superuser.apk on the Market. If successful, this app will let you update from the market even if you've had trouble before.Special thanks to JoÃ«l Bourquard for technical help writing this, and @fitsnugly on twitter for the icon.Note: This app requires busybox. A static build of busybox is included in the app, but is only used if you do not have busybox already installed. The included version should work on most phones. If it does not work for you, please email me at the link below so we can get it working.Support request emails that simply say \"Doesn't work\" or something to that effect are automatically deleted by our stupidity filter and will not be answered.",
