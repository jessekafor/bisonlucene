However if I go to delete old messages from the inbox, they will delete from the list, but if I refresh or get out of the app and come back in they are back. They never actually get deleted. The app is good for using the conferencing features and such. Just not as good as their actual service.",

I\\'d give the company a 5 star rating for service, etc.  BUT on the mobile app, while you can VIEW a fax, you can no longer send a fax!   You can\\'t even go to the website directly because it\\'ll throw you into the mobile login page. The mobile site lacks the fax functionality that you can still get on your laptop! I\\'d use my laptop except I\\'m no longer at my laptop!   I\\'m thinking of canceling my account now.",

I know that wasn\\'t the intention of this app but you may have stumbled upon something.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of people.like me who would love to pay a small monthly fee to be able to use a local number on our existing phone without having to change our main number.  You should look into creating a prison calls app.  I would do it myself but don\\'t.known how. Thank you!!",

Lots of taps required do basic things and no ability to switch between functions (like searching the phone book) except backing all the way out to home screen of app. Then when returning to do a phonebook search your previous efforts are not preserved. App has functionality- but needs some UX attention.",
