    "description": "Wallpapers for both boys and girls! Have fun with your adorable cartoon characters! The most beautiful  princess in kingdom, the sweetest  creatures  or  maybe the bravest hero? - pick the one you like most  for your screen . Keep in mind that there are a lot of them waiting their turn!  Stay forever young with the cartoon wallpapers! -Easy-to-browse interface enables you to find the desired background in no time!- Customize the wallpaper to fit your taste and screen!- Zoom, un-zoom, rotate, move, scale, adjust brightness, add various effects and save your background design!Cartooning is one of the most exciting and fun ways to express yourself through art. Itâs also one of the easiest ways to break into the art field. Cartooning is a form of art, like painting or sculpting. Some  dictionaries describe it as a âsketch or drawing, usually humorousâ which symbolizes or satirizes some action. However, cartooning is so much more than just drawing.  It can be simple or complex, and can be drawn in almost any style; but itâs not an exact duplication of reality. Itâs a representation of the artistâs perceptions of the world, and every person sees the same thing differently. People specializing in drawing cartoons are called cartoonists. Cartoon characters are as endearing to adults as children. Many times we can relate to them. Most of the time we just love to laugh at their antics and misfortune.  Can you imagine a time when Batman wasn't the Dark Knight we know now? Hard to believe the many transformations this superhero has seen through the years, especially on television. Joyful and lovable Mickey Mouse came into our hearts and minds decades ago and still reigns supreme. Heâs like the Jesus of cartoon characters. Homer made us all feel A-OK about being overweight, gluttonous and idiotic. Thanks buddy.Popeye showed us that all you need is a heart of gold and youâll be just fine. A pair of killer pipes donât hurt either.Mischievous and scheming but adorable as well, Garfield has had us grinning for years and years.Many of us had at least one thing with a print of the feathery and friendly Tweety bird, gifted at the art of escape!However, the most memorable cartoon among all generations is Tom and Jerry.  Their polar opposites provided and still provide some great laughs during their constant fighting. They cannot live without each other but we cannot live without their fighting as well. One of the most popular characters is undoubtedly Bugs Bunny -super intelligent and calm. He always seems to know whatâs up â¦ Related to him Elmer is a lovable dope with an unmistakable voice. His mission in life? Shoot Bugs Bunny dead. Itâs been seventy years and heâs still trying.In the late 1930â²s, Daffy came along and established himself as a hilarious and lovable screwball. Weâve been laughing with and at him ever since. He wears a hat and a shirt but no pants. Donald is another character born in the 1930â²s that has stood the test of time with flying colors.Download the wallpapers and have fun!",

        "comment": "Very disappointed with this app. Most of the images don\\'t show up when you click on them and the ones that do aren\\'t even in the right ratio... these are clearly intended for computers rather than phones and you don\\'t get the option for resizing or changing which part of the image is viewable. It does have some lovely images but come on at least make them the right size for a phone if there\\'s no option for resizing.  Also a lot of  pop ups at inappropriate times as well as lots of crashing, uninstalled!!",
