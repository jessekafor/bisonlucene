Also manual chalk is a pain if you forget like I do but this is automatically done on full game. Graphics are superb and game play very smooth. Loads of milage in it compared to most before you get bored of it, if ever. Well done. Wish they were all this good but then again I\\'d be skint. One of, if not the best billiard type games I\\'ve played.",
