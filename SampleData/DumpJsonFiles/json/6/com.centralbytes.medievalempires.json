        "comment": "The only problem I am currently having is that it freezes up every now and then. Other than that I think this app is awesome, simple enough for a mobile device, but holding true to the strategy side. The difficulties hold true to their titles, and give fair competition to you, whether beginner or hardcore RTS gamer. Custom games would be a nice feature, too.",
