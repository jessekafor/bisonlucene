        "comment": "The app works as advertised, with options such as selecting between the low and high bandwidth/quality streams and access to most options also available online. However, the Pause button on the lock screen does not work, it responds to a headset\\'s smart key only to pause but not resume, and if data connectivity was lost - ie you walk into a building with poor reception - it does not automatically resume when it is restored. This requires constant fiddling on the go. Edit 1 May 2013: I\\'ve taken it down from 3 to 2 stars. There is quite a frequent need to force-stop the app, and makes it even less enjoyable than it already was (which was poor).",

When you do pay you can\\'t make a playlist and play only certain songs. I don\\'t care to listen to individual songs I can pay 10 bucks and do that on Spotify. It does appear scrobbling has been fixed on ICS. Overall this app is very laggy as well.",
