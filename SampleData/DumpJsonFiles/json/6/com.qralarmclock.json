    "description": "http://makemyandroidapp.commakemyandroidapp@gmail.comThis is the second step of what I plan to implement(Hint: These plans come from the comments, if you have idea's for what you'd like this app to do or how you'd like to interact with it, please do share =)This app is an alarm clock with a catch. The only way to turn it off is to scan a specific QR Code. You can print the QR code and put it up somewhere in your house that is not next to your bed(Bathroom, Kitchen?). This way when your alarm goes off you will have to get out of bed to turn it off.Perfect if you abuse the snooze button.You can download the QR you need from this website:http://db.tt/8PHTKGcYou must have 'Barcode Scanner' installed to use this application.Props to Havchr, he had this idea originally. I've just made it slightly more user friendly. http://www.havchr.net/Email me if you'd like to see any additional features.@mattanja there should be an \"Email Developer\" button in your market somewhere. If not I can be reacehd at:MakeMyAndroidApp@gmail.com",

        "comment": "QR = Best Ever feature for alarms.  I\\'m surprised that among allllll the alarm clock apps out there, not too many support QR.  Those that do tend to be bulky and overkill for my use.  Early Bird is hideous IMO.  Sleep-as-an-droid does it but that\\'s obviously secondary.  And so on.  This app on the other hand, is QR at it\\'s core.  As others have said, custom audio, standard interface, and a default volume level would be great.   This and multiple alarms would make this a six-star app IMO and all other alarms would be moot for my needs.  Either multiples or custom audio would make it a 5 star.",

I have used other alarm clocks from the market and they all have a standard interface similar to the built in alarm. Changing this and adding more sounds (i.e. the native Android alarm sounds) would raise this to a 5 star app.",
