        "title": "Great app!",
        "comment": "(EDIT) all issues below are fixed! Yay!  This app (version 2.2.1-115) works superbly, but does not appear to cache anything.  At the start of each song, it downloads the song.  So if you pass out of solid connection range, the music quits.  And it needs a solid WiFi connection -- a 4G connection from a car works poorly if at all.  A simple cache of the last 250Mb of song files would make  improvement in functionality.  And it should pre-load the files in the queue.  With that, I\\'d give it a 5",
