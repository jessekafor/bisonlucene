Give gamers more/extra coins and gems for completing goals and expanding their restaurants 2. Give gamers the option to buy and put as much items (ie. Stove, oven, etc.) in their restaurants as they want/like 3. Give more options on timing of making foods - shorter times (1 min, 2 mins, 3 mins, etc.)  Thank you.",

You can\\'t get more than 3 stoves before level 10 but can have 8 counters. What I can\\'t understand the most is why if I cook the same meal it doesn\\'t add to the exact same meal already prepared?! It takes up space on another counter that can have room for another meal. Makes no sense smh If these things were available I\\'ll give it a 5 : D",
