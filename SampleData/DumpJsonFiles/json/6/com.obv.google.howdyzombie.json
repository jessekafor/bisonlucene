Cowboys and Zombies combines RPG, real-time strategy and beat-em-up game mechanics to create a unique experience.  Play Cowboys and Zombies for free!Horror in the Town of PalmtonWelcome to the quiet town of Palmton, a collection of hovels and misery out on the Great Plains, where drifters come to find a little hope, a lot of trouble and, occasionally, a one-way trip to the big ranch up in the sky. See the dingy saloon, the gunsmith shop, the corralâ¦ in this dismal setting we encounter Jackal the bounty hunter, a gun for hire like so many others who have walked the muddy roads of Palmton. But today itâs a different story entirely.Romero, the old gravedigger, recounts what he saw: âLong-time goners from the bone orchard clawed their way outta the dirt! They gone up an' started gnawing each other like they were hungry 'nough to eat a saddle!â The undead had arisen.Not Your Average Shoot-OutSpilling out into the town, the horrible fiends claim their victims. Panic, fear and terror spread through Palmton. Rotting animals and birds soon join the horde of human corpses. The dead of all species walk in Palmton, thirsting for blood.Meanwhile, Jackal the bounty hunter is idling the night away in the saloon in the company of Jane the bartender. When the screams begin, the two of them high-tail it out of the saloon, guns at the ready.Fight like Kilkenny CatsPalmton will soon be overrun by the undead, but Jackal can help! Lead the ace bounty hunter and his rag-tag team of huckleberries as they fight to prevent the ghastly ghouls from taking over Palmton.

Would be better as a more ff style turn based game, there is too much going on to micro manage and trying to select targets amongst a huddle of layers not so fun. Get used to it tho. Other then that the skill sets are cool and I like the idea of the bartender as a healer",
