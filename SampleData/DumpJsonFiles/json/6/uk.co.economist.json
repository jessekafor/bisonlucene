Yesterday the Honeycomb support came out, now it works not at all.  --- I bought a new tablet after losing my old one. Yes, it crashed frequently on ICS and Jellybean, however, I could still read.  However, they have decided you can\\'t even install it for an unknown time-period until they get around to fixing it.  I wonder if they will support a 4.x version of Android before Google STOPS supporting it as outdated.",
