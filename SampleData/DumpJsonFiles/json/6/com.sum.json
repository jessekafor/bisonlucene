    "description": "ATMs offer extraordinary convenience, providing anytime access to cash and account information in the smallest towns and the biggest cities. However, if you use an ATM not affiliated with your own financial institution, you might be required to pay an additional fee for the convenience.The SUM Program allows you to save time and money by offering surcharge-free access to a wide array of ATMs. If your financial institution is a SUM Program member, you can use any SUM-designated ATM without paying a surcharge.Finding SUM ATMs has never been easier when using our ATM locator App. From the convenience of your phone, you can find the location of the closest SUM ATM by entering an address, Zip Code or your exact location using the GPS on your phone.The SUM ATM locator is easy to use and offers these benefits:â¢\tSearch for SUM surcharge free ATMs using your current location, or enter an address or simply a Zip Codeâ¢\tProvides addresses and distance information to closest ATMsâ¢\tProvides convenient turn-by-turn directions to the ATMâ¢\tProvides a link to Google Mapsâ¢\tItâs free",
