Only requests would be 1) to allow a playlist so people can stack tracks. 2) To allow people to browse the program while playing a track, as opposed to having to stop the track just to browse the program. This is an amazing (and totally free) app that I will definitely recommend to friends.",

Plus, there\\'s a forum, which allows you to get more involved in binaural therapy, and really adds a community aspect to this application, making it even more exciting to use.",

I dont fall asleep fast enough to use some of these, plus theres no way to \\'auto repeat\\' or extend them once they end while i sleep. Also i could do with a lower frequency beats that don\\'t sound so loud. Will change rate to 5 just for an \\'auto repeat\\' function though.",
