    "description": "Got a tablet? Check out the tablet optimized version of Sight Words for Reading here:> > click here for HD Tablet version < <This app helps students learn to read sight words, the most common words in children's literature. It covers a few words from both the Fry's and Dolch reading lists. Kids learn to read words presented in context in fun videos. This helps learners understand the meaning of the words, which aids in reading comprehension. After watching the videos to learn new sight words, learners can test themselves with a flash card quiz. The words are presented in a random order, so the quiz is different every time! This free app covers six words from Rock 'N Learn's popular Sight Words DVD program. For more sight words, try these apps: >> Sight Words 1.2 <<.>> Sight Words 1.3 <<.>> Sight Words 1.4 <<.Look for more Sight Words apps coming soon!",

        "comment": "My daughter really enjoys this and repeatedly wants to play this game. The game makes learning fun by including some rather addictive music with the learning of \\'sight words\\'. Its good value because it gets used. Also the practice reinforces the words and the app focuses on common words. By the second game, full sentences are already demonstrated.",

It\\'s really cute and well thought out, but six words?  I\\'m scared to pay for the next version because if it is only six words, that would be a rip-off.",
