I also couldn\\'t find how to create/edit my own layouts, but I think this might be a paid-version-only thing.  However, all I wanted was a keyboard/mouse remote, and this does the job with very little hassle in setting up. The only part of this which I wasn\\'t provided with (which is where this app lost a star) is that there is no Dvorak keyboard built-in, nor is there the option of using the one I already have installed on my phone.  I imagine the Dvorak problem is very simple to fix, so once that\\'s done it\\'ll definitely get a fifth star from me!",
