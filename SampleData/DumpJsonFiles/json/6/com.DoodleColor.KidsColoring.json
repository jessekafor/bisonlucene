    "description": "Doodle Color!â¢ - Kids Coloring Your Photos app is simple & fun for kids of all ages! No upper limit ;) (for Androidâ¢ 2.0 or above)Kids Coloring Features explained:â Simple photo color up method for kids, lets kids easily do color splash effect of object or person they trace/color in the middle of an otherwise black and white photo.â Kids can draw colors on any pictures in your gallery that you screen and select for them using \"Add Pictures\": meaning they can even color InstagramÂ® pics located on your device/sdcard; the app scans for photos and lets you choose which ones to let the kids see and paint colors back in on. Images are loaded in black & white and colors will reappear wherever the kids doodle with their fingers.â Save! Kids' artwork can be saved to your gallery. The original photo is not edited, it remains untouched, just a snapshot of your kids' coloring is saved to a new file.â Multi-Touch! Kids can draw with more than one finger, depending on your phone/tablet's support for multitouch.â Sound Effects! They can be turned off by turning media audio volume control all the way down on device.â Solid color scratch & reveal mode button included, users report its popular with younger kids and even toddlers, especially with the sound effects volume control turned up! This button simply calls a random solid color and when kids draw, they scratch away the solid color revealing a picture.â Brush size: There are three paint brush size options, small brush, medium brush, and large brush.â Easy for kids to use, even younger kids who can't trace well yet or draw within the lines, yet fun for even adults!A more complex feature full version for grown-ups will be released soon! (See doodlecolor.com for info.)If you prefer to let kids color on provided content other than your own photos, try our Doodle Scratch!â¢ Kids Color Draw app instead. Also, please try our Doodle Toy!â¢ Kids Draw Paint drawing app which is popular with children and adults alike! For more mature kids, teenagers, or adults, please try our Doodle Gram!â¢ Photo Collage SMS app :)If you have any feature requests, comments, or suggestions please email us at kidsversion@doodlecolor.comOr contact us online at http://kids.doodlecolor.comor http://www.doodlecolor.com/kidsversion.htmlLegal disclaimer:* All trademarks and copyrights referenced are the sole property of their respective owners.

        "comment": "I was not able to color on my own pictures that I loaded.  Also sound on every touch is annoying.  Had some cool pics  included but not what I was looking for...  EDIT; I tried new version, still not impressed. Still has anoying sounds on every touch, can load my pics now, but they are always upside down or streched.  Kids can\\'t choose colors  or anything, it just displays picture in black and white and finger swipe restores original colors.  Uninstalling again.  I recommend Coloring Pages color and draw by PINADDON for a good kid friendly coloring app instead of this one,  that is the best one I have found.",
