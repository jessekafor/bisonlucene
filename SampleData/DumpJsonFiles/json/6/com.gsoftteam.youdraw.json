    "description": "This is a quick and simple drawing app for your phone. â â â  FEATURES â â â â  You can choose the drawing mode from the four available. â  You can draw freely. â  You can sketch with lines. â  Or you can draw rectangles or rectangles' frames. â  You can set the pen size.â  You may choose a different drawing color. â  Use the reset button  to clear the drawing. â  Use the undo button  to undo a draw action. Although simple this app can help you create beautiful drawings if you just try.We love creating apps, and want to keep them free forever. In order to keep our development running we are using a search service to generate some revenue from this free app. This app will add a couple search links on your device in the form of an icon, bookmark link and browser homepage. You may delete them easily (drag to the trash or delete the link for the browser), if you choose to use them, thanks!NOTE: This game requires additional libraries. Nothing to worry about ! A service called Ministro will download the necessary Qt libraries and install them for you. These libraries will be downloaded once and used by every future Qt app you will install.Become a fan on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/GSoftTeamFollow us on Twitter:http://twitter.com/GSoftTeamTerms of Use: http://www.gsoftteam.com/eulaPrivacy Policy: http://www.gsoftteam.com/privacy",
