    "description": "Clue Loops is THE math puzzle game to exercise your brain!!!!Similar to Sudoku, Clue Loops challenges you to fill in all of the rows and columns of a grid so that no row or column has the same number twice.However, in a Clue Loops puzzle the regions are not limited to squares or even rectangles. Any shape made out of the right number of squares can be a region!The sub-regions must also be filled so that they do not contain any repeated numbers.The Clue Loop regions are helpful hints that show you what the sum of all of the numbers inside of that Clue Loop should be.Clue Loops puzzles are an improvement over Sudoku puzzles for several reasons:1) They come in a variety of sizes: Four rows, five rows, six, seven and eight rows!!2) They are ideal as core activities as well as fillers for students who finish work early.3) They vary in appearance and in types of symmetry.4) They are highly effective reinforcers of all of the following crucial math skills and concepts: addition, subtraction, number fluency, fact families, consecutive integers, triangular numbers, integer partitions, symmetry, shape division, square numbers, concave and convex polygons, multiplication and division.5) Because they are so educational, they are not busywork.Get in the loop now with Clue Loops!!ATTENTION Tablet Owners - We are aware that Clue Loops may not not resize to fill the full screen of some tablet devices.
