    "description": "Digital weather and system info clock widget with size 4x1It features:12/24 hr + Color options on all info displayedSystem Stats InfoHigh resolution weather iconsOption for minutes color to be the same as hoursOption for alternative forecast layoutWeather & Forecast (International)Two weather forecast layoutsInteraction:+tap center->preferences+tap weather icon->forecast+tap Hours->launch anything!+tap Minutes->launch anything!Widgets on Android work a bit differently than a normal application. Unlike regular programs they don't just install themselves in the application tray so you have to add them manually. They will not open or launch.Here's how to add a widget on your Android home screen.STEPS HOW TO ADD A WIDGET==========================1.On your Android home screen, tap any blank or âemptyâ area with size 4x1 and hold down your finger.2.An âAdd to Home screenâ window will pop up. From that window, tap âWidgetsâ.3.Youâll be presented with a list of all the installed Widgets on your Android device.4.Select the clock to add to your home screen by tapping it.Notes=====\"Time frozen/not updating\"-> taskiller killed the clock(exclude it from taskillers)When phone starts, clock starts in less than a min too.ROM users-> make sure the clock is NOT moved on SD card.Widgets are not supposed to be on SD card. Move it back to the phone storage.Weather hint: For world destinations with two words in the name, type in the box the words with a plus sign.For example \"Buenos Aires\" type \"Buenos+Aires\",remember the \"+\" sign -no spaces, don't include the quotes.Email problems/suggestionsCheck our website for more help.EXCLUDE IT FROM TASKILLERS!!!Be polite, this is a free app :-)VIDEO HOW TO ADD WIDGETShttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpMLF9b2aTQ",
