    "description": "Well no one did the icon Vote... :)   Too ambitious!  I'll figure one out on my own ...------  Explanation of problem #2 still applies...Here's the deal with the app name.  The app name has to be unique, so it doesn't clobber other apps in the market.  Check out some of the custom launcher apps, like LauncherPro, which let you rename apps to whatever you want in the launch screen, if you want to call it something besides Mashcord.---------------------------------APP DESCRIPTION:Ever wonder why you never end up recording the things on your cellphone you really want to record?  Maybe it's because it takes for freaking EVER to get to the phone's Video Recorder function!  By the time you get it open and into video recording mode, whatever you wanted to record has already happened!Well now you can just open Mashcord, and go straight to your phones INTERNAL camera software's video recorder.  That's right, no third-party crappy encoding, you're using the same camcorder you always do, but it only takes one click to get there, straight into video recording mode!  Add a shortcut to your Home Screen for even faster access!---Features- Easy 1-click access to your phone's internal video recording mode camcorder- No third party encoding, low quality video, etc- Add a shortcut to your home screen for even faster access",

Works great with Jellybean on S III!  I don\\'t have to stop and save every freaking video!   Thanks, and great job.  Now if you could change the icon to some cool video camera pic and I\\'d be set!",

Ignore all the 1 star ratings, just morons who don\\'t realize it is just a shortcut for Android devices that do not have a camcorder shortcut already i.e. all of them not running an alternate home app.",

Sometimes when you exit out of the app, the resolution changes it\\'s self down to the lowest setting on my galaxy s2, so that the next time you open to quickly record a video, instead of recording in HD, it records in 171r. I have lost a few good moments due to this. This is the only issue i have encountered after 7 months of use. Letting you guys know because i see its still not fixed and not sure if yal are aware of it.",
