I\\'m not sure how you handle the polling for internet connection, but I think it would be helpful to add an option to set a timeout timer so the app isn\\'t running in the background constantly. for example my work router assigns leased ip addresses at 20 minutes at a time. so if I could set a timer for 20 mins after the app last ran, it would only need to poll for connection a very short time before having to sign in again.",

Set up the AP at Starbucks and recorded my login and left - went to Barnes and Noble - and it recognized my attwifi SSID from Starbucks and logged me into BNs access point.  However, when I drove around the corner to Home Depot - they use attwifi as well - and their script is slightly different than Starbucks and BN and the authentication failed - I recorded the login there and it overwrote my Starbucks/BN settings.  I then drove to McDonald\\'s and when i connected to attwifi - the settings from HD were not sufficient to pass on the appropriate credentials to MCD.",

        "comment": "As one of the other reviews points out, this application works fantastic, except there\\'s no mechanism to have different logins for the same SSID.  This is problematic for me with the \\\"attwifi\\\" SSID, since Starbucks, Home Depot, and many others use the same SSID, but have slightly different landing pages.  Basically, the app that\\'s supposed to automatically sign me into WiFi fails on one of the most common free WiFi providers because of this.  It really needs a way to distinguish which script to run by something in addition to the SSID (say, a tag on the page like the <TITLE> element, or something).",
