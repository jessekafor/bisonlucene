    "description": "Rob's is back!Rob's Place Chat was one of the first and most popular chat sites on the web in the '90s. When other rooms used simple HTML and refreshed only when you posted, Rob's already was fully streaming and uninterrupted. Because of this it had thousands of regular users visiting daily, resulted in numerous friendships and relationships, and dozens of marriages too!And now Rob's is back at the leading edge of technology once more, with streaming Ajax chat on virtually all mobile devices from phones to tablets, including Android (and iPhone shortly), as well as PCs and Macs.Whether or not you are a previous user of Rob's, come and see the new chat room and try it for yourself. You can join in the chat using this free app or by visiting robs-place.com on a PC or Mac.Please remember, though, that this is a relaunch, so be patient as the number of users builds up again. In fact you can help by telling your friends and meeting them at Rob's.One more thing. Just like the old Rob's, this new chat service will evolve according to what the chatters want. So you'll be able to tell Rob all the things you want in the chat, and if others agree they'll be added. Just like before, the end result will be the culmination of the wishes of the Community of chatters in Rob's - so everyone will be right at home in a place they all helped to develop.Come and get in at the start (again) - see you in Rob's!",
