        "title": "A pain to locate comics stored on an external SD",
        "comment": "I store my comics on an external (removable) micro SD card. If you do too, Comica has no browser to locate the folder. You must type the path out in a text box. Strike one.  When I did type in the path (/mnt/external_sd/comics), it told me there was no such folder. Strike two. Perfect Viewer had no such problems and let me browse to the folder. And no ads. Sorry Comica. That\\'s just one, two, three strikes you\\'re out.    UPDATE: I did manage to get the program to recognize my folder. And once it works, the UI is beautiful. However, I still say there needs to be a simpler way to add an extra folder. Having to type out the path sucks. Also, in my Comics folder I have series in sub-folders and one shots just in the main folder. Comica had issues with that and hid all my one shots, though in Perfect Viewer and Komik that wasn\\'t an issue.    And some files it just would not open, though PV had no problem opening them.",
