The game was initially announced by its creator, Phil Fish, on TIGSource.com on July 17, 2007. It was later announced that the game would come to the Xbox Live Arcade in early 2010, but it was pushed back. The game was released on April 13, 2012 for Xbox Live Arcade. A Microsoft Windows version will be available on Steam and GOG.com on May 1, 2013, Mac OS X and Linux versions are currently in production, and Fish is working with Sony to identify potential releases to the PlayStation consoles or handhelds. Phil Fish and the later stages of development of Fez were featured in Indie Game: The Movie.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
