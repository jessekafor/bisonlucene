I bought a hotspot for it and my netbook anyway, so I paid the $20 for this and use it exclusively. I intend to replace my phone with it next month and just use the tablet and this for everything. It works for free, but the paid version gives me a number I can give to others. UPDATE: Months later and still using it. Even moved it to another tablet and had it working flawlessly on both for a couple of months.",
