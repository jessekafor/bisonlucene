        "comment": "I don\\'t like knowing that the game is a numbered game or that it has been solved N out of M times. Especially when playing Vegas rules, I want a randomized deck. This game encourages things I would consider cheating, like undo back to some point of a choice and trying the other way. Undo should be for when you realize you just made a mistake, not to try and retry the same game. But, that\\'s what the game encourages by telling you there are a specific number of possible outcomes and some smaller number win.  Otherwise, the game is fairly decent. The controls are OK, though not perfect. It\\'s too easy to accidentally hit something that causes you to exit the game. Then you have to go back in. And, it takes too many clicks to start a new game.",
