It\\'s too bad compal had to mess this up, another person said this too, they force us to use their chinese sites and other garbage! If there is a way to delete/remove them, I sure as heck can\\'t find it. You delete/remove other things, you would think they\\'d have it so you can delete/remove anything you don\\'t want, like it was before and like most, if not all other browsers.
