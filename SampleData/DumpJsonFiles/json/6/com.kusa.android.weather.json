I got the alert the first time, and the second time, and so on and so forth. Unless something changes in the alert I shouldn\\'t be constantly notified about the alert. It\\'s kind of frustrating! Please address and resolve! Thank you.",

        "comment": "There is virtually no way to get this app to stop running other than to uninstall it. I was ok with it for the most part but recent stormy weather triggered an \\\"Alert\\\" notification on the app which began sucking the life out of my battery. The battery drain seemed to be minimized upon acknowledging the Alert, but subsequent Alerts (for the same previously acknowledged alert) restarted the battery drain. Nothing like going from 100% battery to 15% in the span of 30 minutes. Once I might think it was something else with the phone but seeing it over and over again is enough proof for me. I\\'ll just visit the website if I need the weather instead of using this battery sucking app.",
