    "description": "Play the popular game \"Rock paper scissors\" against your friends.The advantage over common games is: It is not necessery that your opponent is online during the game. Just choose your moves and send your challenge. As soon as your opponent is online next time, he can see your request (but not your moves) and choose his own moves. If your opponent has chosen his moves and the game is finished you can see the results in the category \"New finished challenges\". So keep an eye on it!On questions or suggestions please feel free to post it in the 4Q3E-Forum (http://forum.4q3e.com) in the category \"Android Apps\".",
