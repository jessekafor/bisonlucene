    "description": "Please send bugs to the support email with device type so it can be fixed! There are over 2200 Android devices, so it takes time to support them all. Thank you for your patience!A REAL interactive multi-sensor and data visualization scanner with a sci-fi look and feel. This scanner has 9 modules: Solar, Geo, Weather, Audio, Gyro, Mag, GPS, Cam, and Device, three of which are free. Full HD graphics!SOLAR MODULEGraphs the last 96 hours of solar wind plasma readings from the US ACE satellite and displays the most recent Solar X-ray. Measured parameters are Proton Density, Bulk Speed, and Ion Temperature.GEO MODULEDisplays animated global satellite data from NASA on a 3D globe. Last 10 months of land surface temp, sea surface temp, vegetation index, and chlorophyll concentration.WEATHER MODULEDisplays current meteorological conditions from closest weather station. Temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, humidity, precipitation.AUDIO MODULE (requires low-latency hardware, experimental)Displays a spectrum readout of the microphone's audio, as well as current dB levels and Hz frequency. Some Android phones lag or crash on this feature (those without low-latency audio or with lots of background services running).MAG MODULEDisplays device-relative magnetometer readings. Comes with a spheroid visualization and raw microtesla vector and total field data.GPS MODULE (free)Displays WGS84-corrected coordinates on a 3D globe based on NASA satellite images. Zooms and rotates. Also displays readout of latitude, longitude, and altitude values and has a working compass.GYRO MODULE (free)Displays device attitude in real world space (3-axis bubble level). Includes gyro sphere pointing to world up and numerical data for world up vector.DEVICE MODULE (free)Displays device data (unique ID, system memory, graphics memory, graphics API, OS, processor name, number of cores, device name).CAM MODULE (experimental)Turns the scanner screen into a live movie feed. Also displays raw RGB levels of your phone's camera.QUALITY BUTTONAdds screen FX to simulate a CRT monitor. The noise and chromatic aberration effect tax the GPU, so \"high Q\" may not work on all phones.SND BUTTONToggle computer beeps and scan hums. RECOMMENDED TECH SPECS-Low-latency audio pipeline (for Audio Module only). This allows for live analysis of microphone data.-Screen resolution larger than 480x800, 300+ ppi.-If you experience crashes outside of the Audio module, quit other open applications (in Android's Settings menu) and try again, as this is typically due to an out-of-memory error. The app will also continue to be optimized over time to accommodate older phones.Verified on following devices:HTC Nexus OneMotorola ElectrifyLG RevolutionPhoton 4GSamsung Galaxy S3Cam Module may only show black on:Samsung Galaxy NexusSamsung Galaxy WLG Optimus Thrill 4GAsus Eee Transformer TF-101Motorola Droid-xHTC One XSHARP AQUOS PHONE 102SHNexus SAny phone without a camera (naturally)LEGALThis application is not in any way affiliated with any property other than that of its creator.",

Android closes things automatically to make room for the foreground app.  Also, my sgs3 has tons of ram.  Potentially a 5 star app.  Keep going!",
