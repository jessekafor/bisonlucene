Send some greetings and wishes to your friends and families and they will love it!You can attach voice comments to each RIXA moment and interact with other users. You will be able to contact interesting people and make new friends!Whether you love cinema, concerts, theater, animals, cars, bikes, photo, music, dating, surfing or basketball - with this app you can express your passion in a quick, fun and creative way.How does it work? There are 2 ways:1) You take a picture and add a voice comment.2) You record a voice comment and add a picturePictures and sounds are compressed, so the app should also work in locations with low bandwidth.Give it a try! Have fun!tags: Audio, Voice, Chat, Voicechat, Sound, Radio, Dating, Greeting Card, Picture, Photo, Sharing, Rixa, Rixa.com, Rixa.net, fun card, digital postcard, letter, sound card, talking pictures, SoundMomentWe often get questions about the nature of our service. Our view: RIXA is not only for pictures like Instagram. RIXA is not limited to 140 characters like Twitter. RIXA is not a social network like Facebook. RIXA is not a social music network like SoundCloud. RIXA is not on iOS like Digisocial or Vine. RIXA is not like Snapchat. RIXA is not like GroupMe. RIXA is not doing videos like Keek. RIXA is not like QWIKI, Dubbler, CB or Eevzdrop. And RIXA is not like Voxer.Recently we have been compared with Samsung Galaxy S4 Sound and Shot. We feel honored and are proud that we have invented the Rixa Moments first.RIXA is RIXA and we love Android!",
