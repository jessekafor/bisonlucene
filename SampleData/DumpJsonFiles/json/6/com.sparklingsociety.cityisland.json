        "comment": "I love this game,  but the update has frozen it. Is there a way to force it to close?  I\\'m hopelessly addicted and really enjoy planning and rearranging the city. Does this new update provide more shops and houses? I was thinking that city bus stops, an antiques store, a public beach sign & life guard station and a bait & tackle shop might be great additions. And please, more houses.  Is there anyway to buy gold with the cash you\\'re accumilating from the businesses? Im just about at the point where the only way I can continue is to slowly wait for the gold pieces to collect.  Love this game and hope you\\'re able to do something about the game freeze.  I wish I hadn\\'t checked yes when it asked me if I wanted to update.",
