    "description": "Use your phone's GPS to track your runs when you ski or snowboard. Find your friends while you're on the mountain and playback your day seeing the run names and their difficulty. Our charts show your steeps, speed, and run difficulty. Share your adventure with your Fresheez Friends and on Facebook, Twitter, and soon Google+. Besides skiing and riding, Fresheez is great for hiking, biking, running, golf, sailing, horseback riding... anything outdoorsy.Best of all is Fresheez SnowQuest: Compete with your friends just by skiing and riding, on day out and over the entire season! Play Top Dog (difficulty of runs), Scorched Snow (top sustained speeds), Slacker (last one down the mountain wins!) and The Long Slog (distance). With SnowQuest you also get a trophy case for your achievements on the mountain. SnowQuest: the game is real.Fresheez supports resorts in the US and Canada, as well as around the world.
