        "comment": "That\\'s a fantastic app. Thanks for developing it. But here are some recommendations. First, please integrate other languages than English. I usually switch between various languages, but cannot do so with ShareKM. Second, if I want to disconnect the mobile phone safely after I have used SharedKM, Windows will not allow me to do so due to some ADB process unless I kill the process by means of the taskmanager. THird, sometimes the program kept on connecting and disconnecting to the phone.",
