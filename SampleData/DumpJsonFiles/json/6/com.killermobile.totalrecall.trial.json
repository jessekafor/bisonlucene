    "description": "Total Recall Call Recorder for Android 14 Day Trial | No Spamware. No Ads. No Spyware. Just the Best Call Recording App on the Planet!------------------------------Now Recording Calls on the Samsung Galaxy S3 / SGSIII (root required with Jellybean devices)!------------------------------Unlike many other Call Recorders on the Market Total Recall is designed to record your call directly from the line NOT the Mic, resulting in higher quality audio on compatible devices. Many other devices that do not support this can still configure the app to record from the mic, resulting in lower quality (however useable) audio. And unlike many Ad-based or so called \"Free\" applications, we don't eat up precious Data or Battery Life by constantly downloading new ads, and with Total Recall you can rest assured there's no spyware or other types of malware. Killer Mobile has been building and supporting our mobile apps since 2003.--------NOTE |Galaxy S2 users (including those running ICS/4.0)  please download our Call Recorder specifically setup for the S2 here:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.killermobile.totalrecall.s2.trialGalaxy Note users go here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.killermobile.totalrecall.note.trialTotal Recall is the most Popular, Feature Packed Call Recorder on the Planet and has been since 2004.

Plus, Total Recall is one of the few Call Recorders that actually records from the LINE not the MIC (on compatible devices).Key Features------------> Manually or Automatically Send your recorded audio via Email/Gmail or upload to your Evernote Account> Smartly Named Clips include the Contact Name/Number, Date, Time & More. Easily Rename clips to whatever you want> Automatically Record Calls Or Manually Record Calls from a Notification bar> Optional Dialogs letting you know when the app is recording> Record All Calls, Incoming Calls, Outgoing Calls or only Certain Numbers or Contacts> Widget for quick recording of Voice notes (perfect for Lectures, Meetings, Classes, Memos, Reminders)> Record in AMR, WAV, MP4 & 3GPP (formats)> Play back recorded calls directly from the appWe're constantly updating Total Recall to support new devices and OS versions, adding new features (including many user requests).  Have a request? Let us know we're listening!---------------IMPORTANT NOTES---------------** Please confirm the legality of call recording in your local jurisdiction prior to use.** Not all Android devices are capable of Call Recording while others only support call recording via the Microphone, which can sometimes be improved by putting the call on speakerphone. Please test Total Recall prior to purchase** Some devices will be unable to record calls while using a Bluetooth Headset or Handsfree car kit, however an option is available to automatically NOT record calls while using a BT device.TOTAL RECALL RECORDS CALLS GREAT ON-----------------------------------> Galaxy S2 & Note> Droid Inredible 2> Samsung Galaxy S Plus, Galaxy S (running OS 2.1) Galaxy Tab (running 2.2 & 2.3), Galaxy S3> HTC Evo, Hero, Dream, Inspire, Tattoo & Others> Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 / X10 Mini / X10 Pro / X8> Sony Ericsson Xperia Pro / X12 / AnzuTotal Recall Call Recorder is Just Another Killer App by Killer Mobile (R)!

Instead of answering your questions directly, they give you the run around. It\\'s also not the number one call recorder. It\\'s about the tenth, if you search the Play Store. This recorder sucks and the makers know it, despite lies to the contrary. Nuff said.",

I found no way of knowing the answer to that question without leaving the screen and going to Records. Once there, I found it to be empty so I  assumed that it did not work. When I went back to the test screen, it starts all over again so you cannot answer the question. Not impressed.",
