        "comment": "I don\\'t understand how this app has a 4.7 star rating, but I wish those folks had given a small sentence about how to use it. I\\'ve installed twice, unless I\\'m missing something, but do not see the app\\'s icon in my downloads, and when I click on it in the Play Store downloads, I get this screen????? Don\\'t download if you\\'re short on phone space..not worth the extra never erasing bloatware when you uninstall it.",
