    "description": "Turn your phone into a real universal remote with IR Universal Remote! You can control your own devices or play a funny prank on your friends. There is no need for any additional software, accounts, or attachments. This application will save you $$$ on replacement batteries alone. The best part is, IR Remote can be updated at anytime with new features and graphics for free! How many of your current universal remotes can do that? This application is meant to be an easier to use Peel and Watch On alternative.*NEW as of 09/05/2013 as Promised- Online Remotes! Over 10,000+ new supported devices! Online Remotes do require an internet connection. I will work on the ability to save remotes locally. (That way you only need an internet connection when you want to save a new remote.) I will also update the graphics to match the original graphics. The online remote section is still in beta and will be updated with many improvements in the near future! I have been working on implementing the online remotes feature for a few weeks now so I have not had the time to respond to all of your emails.. Sorry for that.. there are a lot of user requests and only 1 of me.. I hope this makes up for some of the missed requests! Thanks for all of the positive feedback it really helps! Don't spend hours manually typing IR codes! Simply find the device you want and start clicking with IR Universal Remote!This application was developed for Samsung devices that have an IR Blaster sensor. HTC One is currently not supported.Galaxy S3 is NOT supported. The GS3 does not have an IR Blaster..What users are saying!âââââ Ryan Hastie on Jul 31, 2013 at 9:27 PMAwesome   Works with my 6 series samsung lcd tv. Laziness has come to a whole new level in my life now! Cheers, I can freak my flat mates out now hahaâââââ Jake Melkowski on Jul 21, 2013 at 10:51 PMWorks great!\t   I love this app. I always have so much fun in the bars making people wonder why the TVs keep going off!âââââ Jeremy Douglass on Jul 7, 2013 at 11:33 PMNice    Great app dude, was at costco today... im sure you see where this is going, funny seeing everyones reactions when all the tvs start randomly start tuning off haha. ThanksIR Remote was initially built for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Currently Samsung Galaxy devices that have built in IR Blaster sensors are supported. If your phone (or Tablet) has an IR blaster and you would like to try this application on your device then feel free. Search on google first to see if your device has an IR Blaster sensor before trying. Please do not leave spam comments if your device does not have an IR Blaster sensor.Note: IR Remote was not developed by a team or a company. IR Remote was developed by one person who also has a completely separate full time job. I can only build on this application during spare time which is usually the weekends.. I just noticed a lot of emails saying \"you guys\".. but really it's just me! :) Please.. If you have any trouble using IR Remote or you have a device that is not currently supported, then send me an email. Please do not just leave a poor comment or rating. I will be more than happy to assist you!",
