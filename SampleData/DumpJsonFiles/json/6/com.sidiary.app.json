    "description": "In case of incompatibility please have a look on our website: http://www.sidiary.org/customerservice-faqv6-2088.asp?IDSprache=2To work with a diabetes logbook on your Android device is very simple with SiDiary. You can track all relevant data for your therapy like blood glucose, carbohydrates, medication like insulin and so on quick in a simple data mask to make it visible on your Android device. You can analyze it with the statistic function or with our trend analysis.If you already use the PC version of SiDiary to read out your meters, insulin pump, etc. - you can add this data also to your Android device by simply synchronizing it with SiDiary Online.The features of this app so far:â¢\teasiest entry of all data with the numeric keypadâ¢\tall data can be tracked with a scrollable input maskâ¢\tclearly arranged display of your daily data in SiDiary's typical styleâ¢\tlots of statistic-graphics (pie chart, line graph, modal day and detailed statistic)â¢\ttrend analysis (how was the progress of your therapy in the last days/weeks/months?)â¢\tfast synchronization of your data with 'SDiary Online', from where you are able to print your data stand-alone from your operating system or synchronize the data with your desktop computer version of SiDiaryâ¢\toption for automatically synchronization (after shut down the app and/or at midnight)â¢\tuser defined data types, which you have defined in your pc-version can also be used on the Android after a synchronization with 'SiDiary Online'â¢\tblood glucose values can be entered in mg/dl or mmol/lâ¢\tbody weight can be entered in kg or lbsâ¢\tcarbohydrates can be entered in gram or any other exchange unit (such as BE/KE, etc.)â¢\tdate format dd.mm or mm-ddâ¢\ttime format 24h or 12h am/pmâ¢\tdata rows that you don't want to use can be hiddenYou can use 'SiDiary Android' stand-alone, but this version can also enhance the pc-version - e.g. you can download readings from your blood glucose meter, insulin pump, blood pressure meter or pedometer with your pc-version and enter additional data on the way in your Android version. After synchronizing your desktop computer and your Android both with 'SiDiary Online' all of your data will be merged into one logbook. Since synchronization with 'SiDiary Online' will be started manually - you always have the full control of possible costs for your online connection.You can use the app in the adware mode (with commercial ads) as long as you wish. Please note that in this mode only the last 7 calendar days can be synchronized with SiDiary Online.The app claims for the following rights (legend in brackets):â¢\tread phone state and identity (to build the apps serial number)â¢\tyour roughly estimated (network-based) location (for commercial ads in your language)â¢\tfull internet access (download ads and transfer data on demand to SiDiary Online)â¢\tstorage (to store data locally on your device)â¢\tpaid services (send short messages: optional, must be turned on first: when the blood glucose is exceeding or falling below the limit values a SMS can be send to a predetermined number (eg, to the parents or the diabetes team)â¢       system tools (to establish Bluetooth connection to Fora Diamond Mini BT glucose meter by request)",
