You only get the bedt board , Rider and tricks in the last few levals. So why are there not entire upper upper levals. I would pay to play them after u beat the game whice i can now do w my eyes closed. I keep uninstalling and reinstalling this game becuase its the best one and its been that way for at least two years. OH YA WHERES THE HALF PIPE TOO.",
