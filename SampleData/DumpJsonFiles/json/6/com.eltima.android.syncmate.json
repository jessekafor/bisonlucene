        "comment": "It\\'s one thing to have an app that doesn\\'t work very well, or crashes, or is hard to use.  It\\'s a whole other thing when it trashes important existing data on your smartphone and computer.   This app has basically made my existing calendaring function and data completely unusable.  There is massive amounts of duplication that happens when you sync calendars - it does not recognize existing info.  In some cases I now have 8 instances of the same appointment.  You have to go through your entire calendar and delete all dups manually every time it syncs.  Then for reoccurring appointments - it gets it wrong - putting them on the wrong days, weeks or months.  Are you kidding?  They are actually trying to sell this stuff - it\\'s the worst app I\\'ve ever used.   After reading the other reviews - I see that this is a low quality product put out by folks who obviously don\\'t know what they are doing and don\\'t care what damage they are causing to their users.  Otherwise they would have fixed this - and it\\'s not that complicated to fix.  I\\'ve been a software engineer for 35 years - and know that this is due to bad software design and coding - and could be fixable.  But they have not.",

So if you can not connect to the web or Eltima decides not to support SyncMate anymore or Eltima gets shut down, you can not start your desktop client anymore. Money completely wasted. This is about the most paranoid developer I have ever seen. And this for a third-class little helper app, its ridiculous. It is so customer unfriendly that I can only recommend: hands off! Also: It does not update detail informations, for example if you add a phone number to an existing contact on the Mac, the change does not get synced to the mobile.",

Plugged in, turned on USB with debugging as advised in the application and connected. Took 2-3 minutes.   I enquired about an issue with external SD cards and mounting them and had a proper helpful e-mail response in about 15 minutes actually answering my question and resolving it. So clearly Customer Service is working.   SyncMate is so much better than the standard Android Mac file transfer which is basically rubbish.   Its made pretty clear that this is a paid for application, why do people think it should be free? Grow up, read the web site and try it out.   I don\\'t need it to sync calendars or contacts as I have separate applications that link into my corporate mail and calendars.   The new version they sent me handles internal and external SD cards correctly. I use that to move music around as I actually don\\'t want to auto sync given I have 100GB of music.  I use this on two Mac\\'s as per the license and had the same easy experience.  So overall I find it works well, is easy to install, the customer service has been good for me.",

        "comment": "No customer support! I purchased the expert edition (v3) for $40 a few months ago this year. I had a problem with my computer and asked for them to send me a copy of v3. They\\'re telling me that now they have version 4 and no longer support v3 and I have to pay an additional $40 to get the expert edition! WTF! Additionally, it will cost extra for CD copies, lifetime upgrades, etc... Now I\\'m stuck with a fully paid product with limited use!",
