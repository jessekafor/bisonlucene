    "description": "MyCEDict is a Chinese-English Dictionary. There are 2 main functions, the dictionary powered by CC-CEDict and the translation powered by MyMemory. You can search with Chinese characters (both traditional and simplified), pinyin, english or using voice recognition. In case you want to translate a whole sentence, choose the translation tab and input the whole sentence. It is bi-directional, that means you can translate Chinese-English or English-Chinese. It would be better if you use written form rather than spoken form. e.g. use \"I have had lunch\" rather than \"I've had lunch\". Furthermore, you can jot notes by copy and paste into My Notes.  Number of vocabs: ~103,000 Chinese vocabs.Source of dictionary database: CC-CEDict (http://cc-cedict.org)Source of translation API: MyMemory (http://mymemory.translated.net)",
