        "comment": "First of all, to all the haters who complain about the app functionality, and the fact his website crashed (in turn making all apps crash) because it got TOO POPULAR for the bandwidth... for ONE day... and it wasn\\'t even a Sunday... you all can suck it.  For anyone who wants a real, unbiased look at Fantasy Football, with strategic, smart and priceless advice to boot... this IS the app.  It\\'s not just about one guy who thinks he\\'s a fantasy god, it\\'s about a community of fantasy junkies who use Mr. Guru as a channel in which to communicate breaking news directly related to your teams success. It\\'s about a real look at rankings, who to cut, who to buy, and who to incubate...  I believe that the Guru, the true center of the flourishing community, cares about nothing except football and OUR teams. I believe he sits, in his underwear, with a box of pizza, a thousand televisions, in his mom\\'s basement, making his wife communicate to him via notepad, eyes bloodshot, laptop in lap, and never sees the light of day from August to February.  Go from beginner to pro, go from veteran to wise. I did. Pay the 10 bucks, you\\'ll want to pay more. He won\\'t remain a well kept secret for long.",
