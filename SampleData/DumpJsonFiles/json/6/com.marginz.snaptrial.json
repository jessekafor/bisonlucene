    "description": "This is a trial version of Snap Camera.It has all the features of the paid app but will only start if your device doesn't have an internet connection.Enable airplane mode (or disable all data connections) to use this trial app so you can decide if you want to buy it.The best possible camera experience with regular updates and new features added all the time.Snap Camera lets you take pictures and record video with a single click, no cluttered preview screen, just the two buttons you really need. Snap Camera's interface is based on the camera included in Android 4.2 (jelly bean) on the Nexus 4 but with many extra features.Snap Camera has a simple, powerful user interface featuring:  * Touch to focus * Pinch to zoom * Swipe to review * Long press to adjust photo settings with the photo controller. The photo controller includes settings for: * Colour and Contrast (if supported by the hardware). * Silent Shutter * Burst Mode * Self Timer * Panorama mode * Flash mode * Whitebalance * Exposure * Grid lines * Fast picture mode * HDR * Additional SettingsThe additional settings menu gives you access to many extra settings. * Picture and Video Size * Scene mode * Self Timer delay * Burst Mode settings * Time Lapse * Still and Video Focus Modes * JPEG Quality * Effects * ISO  * Anti-banding * Scene Detection * Video Bitrate  * Audio SettingsThe photo editor lets you: * Add colour effects * Add a border * Crop, Rotate, Mirror * Straighten * Add image effects * Histogram Modification * VignetteAdditional Features - You can see what effects will be applied and undo an effect at any time from the history menu- Share an image with any other app such as Facebook or Google+ by clicking on the share icon- Create panoramas by selecting the panorama icon (Android 4.0 and above)- Fast picture mode instantly captures photos at the preview resolution.- Capture still snapshots during video recording (if supported)- Use the volume buttons to focus and take a picture- Auto torch mode for low light video recording- Use the advanced video settings to record video in resolutions not allowed by other cameras. For example, this gives you 720p video recording on the Nexus 7.High Dynamic Range (HDR)HDR is a feature that lets you take pictures of scenes with very dark and/or very light areas. Swipe up on the controller to enable HDR mode. The app takes two photos at different exposures and combines them to make one HDR photo.See here for details of HDR:http://marginz.co.nz/index.html#HDRHDR mode is still experimental and only supported on ARMv7 devices with NEON, let us know if it doesn't work well on your device.Snap works best on newer phones but will still run on older models.Some features are only available on phones that support them. Camera apps are notoriously difficult to make compatible with all hardware.Please install and test the trial version first before you buy the paid app.The trial version has all the features of the paid app but will only start in Airplane mode.Please visit our website for tips and more details about the settings and features. There is a discussion forum here:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2055140Please use this to report bugs, ask questions and suggest new features.This app will install 2 icons in your launcher, one for the Gallery and one for the Camera. Some launchers also put the Gallery icon on your home screen.If video recording does't work on your device, try these suggestions:http://marginz.co.nz/index.html#videofailIf the preview doesn't display correctly try enabling safe mode:http://marginz.co.nz/index.html#safeCheck out our great video to see Snap Camera in action.",

It be nice to have options hidden that your phone does not support.   I like the quick access to different camera modes though.   Thank you for offering a free trial as I\\'d of been quite dissapointed if I bought the app.  Remove the HDR option though as its a waste of time and just looks noisy and washed out.   Kudos for giving us all another choice though.",
