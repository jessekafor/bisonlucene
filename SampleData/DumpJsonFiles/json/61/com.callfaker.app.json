        "comment": "I have been a paying customer for over 1 year now and this app has been great WHEN IT WORKS, however, that is only about 50% of the time. Now they\\'ve added ads to the app that are still there even AFTER you pay for it. The site seems to crash multiple times per week and a lot of times you may try to make a call and it will just hang up on you or ring and ring forever or some weird automated voice will come on saying, \\\"press 1 for....\\\" and say something that has nothing to do with the app. The worst part is, it charges you tokens that you\\'ve paid for, even when it doesn\\'t connect. Now when the app does work, it works perfectly. You can call from any number and have it show up on peoples caller ID\\'s as whatever you want and it will actually show the name and number of the persons number you are spoofing as if it were them actually calling you. This is the ONLY app like this I have ever seen and I almost wish there were some competitors out there so these guys would step their game up and make the app flawless. For now it\\'s a 3 star app with the potential for 5 stars, without a doubt!",
