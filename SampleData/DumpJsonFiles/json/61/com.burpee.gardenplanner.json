Locks up often and has to be force closed to get back into app. No alphabetical sort option for plants in garden. It\\'s a list,  why can\\'t we sort it? Planting times are so general as to be useless. Tells me to plant anywhere from March to June. Jeeez! I need an app to tell me that? This app needs about 6 more updates just to be usable.",
