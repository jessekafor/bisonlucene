    "description": "Wanna transfer a file to your friend nearby you? But he or she is not in your contact list? This app may help you.SonicShare is a new way to send files. You do not need the wifi tethering, bluetooth, gps, nor input any ip, cloud link, email address, tel, id, nor select the names from a long contact list (but finally found that he is not in your list :P) In order to achieve a file transfer, the only thing you need is your friends are nearby you, both open this app, select the file/item, and click the SEND button. The file will be passed to your friends' devices. Simple enough?You can send any kinds of file. jpg, mp3, wmv, mp4, txt, xls, pdf, apk .... no format limitation. Besides the files, by using the interface provides by this app, you can also send URL, sms text, contact, android apps (apk), app market link, clipboard content, your predefined name card, web history, ... This app also supports 1-to-many transfer, which means if you want to share a file to 10 friends, you just send once, then all your friends will receive the sent file in a few minutes. Interesting?BTW, why do not use Bluetooth? Yes, bluetooth does the same thing. But it requires many approval steps and some compatibility problems between devices. Do you have any bad experience in sending files via bluetooth but fail finally after tons of annoying steps? I have many. :PIf you want to contact me or want to be one of the developers, drop me a mail at cantfactory@gmail.comThanks a lot of trying my apps.

Also, please explain How did you generate such high frequencies on android hardware currently available? How are you receiving such high frequencies on the target device(s)? Are there no filters(digital or analogue) available on currently available android devices for audio input and output?",

        "comment": "I cannot use this on my tablet, so I assume it is not ICS friendly even though it says \\\"Android 2.1 and up\\\". Can only use on my phone but would be nice to be able to do phone to tablet or vice versa. Also, you uploading files to the server and claiming to delete in 15 minutes is a bit scary to me. The cartoon GUI is kind of tough too deal with long term I think. Pretty cool idea, but without tablet or ICS support it is a little limiting and the file server upload could get dicey IMHO. That means.. they could peak at your dirty photos.",
