    "description": "------------------------ WARNING ------------------------THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE BETA! IF YOU ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS such as crashes or features not working as expected, please email what action caused the crash and your device type to support@andreapp.com so we can fix the problem.There are a few features that are not final. Please do not try this app unless you are comfortable with these limitations:- Limited documentation- A few UI elements need polishingThis is a free demo. All features are fully functional, the only difference is an occasional upgrade dialog message.The universal remote control interface for Android!Andre is a fully customizable, feature rich front end for controlling things. What things? Anything that can be controlled over the network, including home automation software (such as Promixis' Girder), IR transmitters (like the Global Cache IP2IR), alarm systems, media servers and players, IP controllable A/V hardware, and more.A handful of usage examples:- Universal Remote for home theater- Alarm system control/status- Whole house music control- Home/office monitoring from anywhere- Lighting and environment status & control- Weather station- Custom sound board- Music/video catalog- IT server monitoring and control- Router control interfaceAndre is server-agnostic and supports http(s) and TCP communication. For most uses Andre is paired with server software/hardware that is capable of communicating through one of these protocols such as home automation apps (Girder, PowerHome, HAI, HomeSeer, mControl, Control4, Vivint and many others), media software (XBMC, JRiver, MediaPortal, etc.), and alarm systems. More and more hardware is becoming controllable this way, including A/V receivers, set-top boxes and DVRs, weather stations, even alarm clocks and digital picture frames.  PLEASE NOTE: WHILE ANDRE *IS* CAPABLE OF A LOT OF STAND-ALONE FUNCTIONALITY ON THE ANDROID DEVICE ITSELF, MOST COMMON USES REQUIRE SERVER SIDE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE THAT IS NOT PART OF ANDRE. If you are unsure if Andre will do what you want please visit http://www.andreapp.com for more info or to ask questions. We will be happy to help!
