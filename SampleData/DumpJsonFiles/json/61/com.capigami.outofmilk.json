Makes it real easy to keep track of how much you\\'re spending and keep up on what\\'s on sale at all your local grocery stores. Shopping gets done so much faster now because I can keep everything organized, get exactly what I need, and avoid having to backtrack to get anything I missed.  The To Do List feature is also great. It\\'s like having a personal assistant without having to pay for it.  The \\\"Add from history\\\" feature is also great. Everything you enter is stored in history so when you need to buy that item again, there\\'s no need to retype it. You simply check off the items you need and then add them to your new list.  I\\'ve been using this app for several months and it is such a great help.",

I like that you can also have a \\\"to-do\\\" list, but figuring out how to delete a completed list took longer than necessary. (BTW, go to settings, customizations, to-do tap action, display menu; but even getting to settings wasn\\'t terribly straightforward)  But it\\'s still a good app.  Not to be confused with another \\\"milk\\\" app, which I tried over a year ago and didn\\'t like.  I didn\\'t think milk was all that popular in the real world...",

Our whole family is in college and our days are so busy between college and work.  ... This app is wonderful.  Whomever finds time to stop at the grocery store simply checks the list on their phone and checks items off.  Awesome!",
