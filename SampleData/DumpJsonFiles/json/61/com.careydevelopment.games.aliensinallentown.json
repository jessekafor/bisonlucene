    "description": "BACK STORY----------It's the near future. Allentown, PA has returned to its roots and become an industrial complex, providing jobs for thousands.Until the Second Great Depression.Now, most of the warehouses and office buildings are shuttered, leaving only remnants of a once great economy.As a result, labor unions protested and riots erupted.You are Lieutenant Rick Barrett, U.S. Army. You have been stationed in Allentown to help prevent further riots.But you never saw this coming: Aliens have invaded.But why, out of all the places on the planet, would they choose Allentown as a point of entry?GAME PLAY---------The joystick on the left controls your movement. The up arrow on the right is the icon you press to jump. The icon to the right of that, which looks like a splat, is your attack button.You're armed with a Beretta 198F - the most powerful shotgun in the known world.Of course, these aliens aren't from \"the known world\" are they?Scoring: You get points for killing enemies. You will also gain time bonuses for \"clearing out\" certain areas of all enemies. If you restart the level or the game, your score resets to 0. This is only fair, as we don't want people restarting a level over and over again just to gain a higher score. There IS a high score board!There is no health bar. You will instead hear your heart beat louder as you lose health. DEVELOPER NOTES---------------I do this as a hobby and the game is free - so no complaints! ;)Seriously, let me know if you find any lingering bugs. I will try to take care of them.I had to trim a lot out to make it under Google's 50Mb limit. Sorry, but I'm not going to try to deal with supplemental files in Unity. I have my sanity to preserve!I know that it is difficult to dodge enemy projectiles, especially with that joystick. So I have made those projectiles (with the exception of Species 42 projectiles) weak on damage.Still not sure if I'm getting old or if the joystick is just too sensitive. There's a careful balance between being able to move fast to dodge enemy projectiles and being so sensitive it's tough control properly. Perhaps I'm still on that learning curve.I don't like the pixellated particle systems. They don't appear that way on my PC, but they do on my Droid devices. That might just be par for the course with mobile development. I'm still new at this. LOL!I intentionally left out reloading. With most games, it seems to be just a formality, and I have limited real estate for icons on mobile devices.Following modern conventions in video game development, I have intentionally left out a \"health bar\". Instead, you will hear your heart beat louder as you lose health, until you die. No, the screen doesn't go black and white. I need Unity Pro for that.I plan on doing more with this. There are also a couple of other game ideas that I have in mind, so it's a matter of priorities.",

        "comment": "I am on an lg motion. Transmissions and instructions were scrambled and font did not fit the designated box. Motion control was a bit clumsy found it hard to turn around. Climbing the stairs was a challenge, when I finally made it to the top on to the building I ended up falling off frustrated I quit. I do not know all that goes into developing a game so all I can honestly say is it has potential.",
