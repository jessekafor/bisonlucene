    "description": "The Callcentric Android app allows existing Callcentric customers to place calls worldwide using their Callcentric account and save significant money over cellular carrier calling rates. This is particularly useful to customers who want to save money on international calls, or want the caller ID of their Callcentric account to show up on outbound calls they place instead of their Android phone number.Just download the app and configure your Android phone number, Callcentric username and password, and you're ready to start calling. When you place a call from the app you will first receive a callback to your regular Android phone number, and when you answer your Android you will be connected to the party you dialed.â¢ Traveling overseas?In many places around the world you can obtain a local SIM card either for your un-locked Android or a pre-paid and cheap GSM mobile phone. In many countries inbound calls to your mobile number are free, and by combining this with the Callcentric app you can place calls back home or worldwide for much lower rates than roaming with your phone, placing calls from your hotel, or even using a locally obtained SIM card.â¢ Use it from other phones!You can even set a different phone number than your Android phone number in the Callcentric app, and the number you enter will be called first to initiate your call. For example, perhaps you're staying at a friends house and want to place a call that doesn't get charged to their phone? Simply enter the phone number of your friends home phone in the app, and you can initiate a call that will first ring your friends phone, and then when you answer connect you to the party you want to call, all without your friend receiving any charges on their bill.â¢ Even call Callcentric 1777xxxxxxx numbers!Using the Callcentric app you can call any other Callcentric customers 1777xxxxxxx number, even if they don't have a \"real\" phone number. You can also place calls to other VoIP networks using Callcentric and SIP Broker.â¢ See your Callcentric account balance anytimeYour Callcentric account balance is always shown within the Callcentric Android app.â¢ Dial as you wishYou can dial manually from the keypad, from your recent call history, or by using the contacts on your Android.â¢ Want to use Callcentric directly over VoIP from your Android?There are many 3rd party apps available for the Android that will allow you to use your Callcentric account over Wi-Fi or 3G data and place calls using VoIP softphones.â¢ A note about charges:Please note that regular data charges may apply if using the Callcentric app over a cellular data network (2G / 3G), and regular call charges will be applied by your cellular carrier for receiving inbound calls to your Android or the number you enter as \"My Number\" in your settings. Calls placed from the Callcentric Android app will incur 2 charges on your Callcentric account: 1 for the call to your Android or number you enter as \"My Number\", and the 2nd for the call placed to the person you are calling, both at standard Callcentric rates.â¢ Note to Verizon / Sprint / CDMA network based Android customers:The Callcentric Android app uses data to communicate with the Callcentric network. CDMA networks (Verizon/Sprint in the USA) don't support using data (2G / 3G) and voice simultaneously unless you are connected to a Wi-Fi network. Because of this, CDMA Android customers may have difficulty using the Callcentric app, especially if you are using it while not connected to Wi-Fi AND while in a 2G (1XRTT) data coverage area.",

        "comment": "what a wasted opportunity.  this is just a generic softphone dialer with some dial-back functionality for people whose VOIP usage orbits around their cellular account.  what i would have wanted to see out of a \\\"CallCentric App\\\" would have been GUI\\'ed Android access to my CC vmail, call history and settings as well as vanilla dialing.  the \\\"history\\\" only shows the calls seen by the app while running; NOT the call activity seen by the DID.  the architect seems stuck in the 1990\\'s cell carrier mindset: the internet is just some pimple on a cell-phone.  this GalNote owner sees his Android device as a pocketable internet device that can connect over a cellular carrier, as well as wifi, and that allows voice communication as value-added.  this \\\"app\\\" shows all the design creativity of a \\\"Call-Centric complimentary grocery tote-bag\\\".  it\\'s a good thing that it\\'s free, although it\\'s still overpriced.",
