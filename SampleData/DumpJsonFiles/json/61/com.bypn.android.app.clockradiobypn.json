        "comment": "A nice enough app, with a simple enough interface.  Worked well for a couple of weeks.  During that time it once fell back on the default Android ringtone, but now it seems to be a daily issue.  I even tried to test the alarms, and created a new alarm as well.  The tests and new alarm all worked while playing with the app, but when left overnight to wake me in the morning, I was back to the default Android ringtone.  Not sure what the problem is, but it\\'s failing to wake me to my favorite internet radio station now, so I have to start searching for something that will.",

The option to turn off song display on the screensaver is perfect. Add multiple fonts and a color mixer and you have a winner for sure. Changed my rating to five stars.",
