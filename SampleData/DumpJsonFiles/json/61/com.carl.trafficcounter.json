It placed an icon in the notification bar and sat there - forever, telling me it was \\\"updating\\\". Updating what? It certainly wasn\\'t updating my traffic statistics all of which remained steadfastly at zero. As others suggest, this is now perhaps just spyware accessing your personal data. Perhaps the PRO version which you have to have for virtually any function other than the bare basics (perhaps even to have it count your data traffic - who knows) which the dev prods you toward all the time, gives you back your personal data and even a little bit of actual functionality - at a price? LOL. Tacky app. AVOID.",

It works perfectly well in the background, and in that it is unique among all cell data usage monitoring apps. There are fancier looking data apps out there, most of them being overloaded heavy pigs, which call back home frequently from the background and thus actually increasing data usage. Traffic counter uses only the permissions needed for it\\'s operation, as far as I can see. Traffic Counter could benefit from a little interface update. If the autor could consider upgrading also to display the applications cell and wifi usage separately, I will gladly pay for a Pro version. Since Onava has been \\\"upgraded\\\" to be useless it is the right time now.    Peter Kroll, Singapore",
