Do NOT download this product.  What\\'s wrong with these guys. Signing up customers is not rocket science. It\\'s a terrible business model to keep customers waiting for weeks for something that could happen over night in a more professionally run company. Wake up, guys. Look at the business you are scaring off with your lazy attitudes towards us.",
