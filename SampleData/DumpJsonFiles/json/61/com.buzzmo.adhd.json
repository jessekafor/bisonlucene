        "comment": "Minimal content, and what content exists is hidden between a \\\"Download a free game!\\\" popup.  1) The \\\"About ADHD Researcher\\\" link goes to an error page \\\"file:///data/data/com.buzzmo.adhd/files/resources/buzzmo/ADHDa/aboutpr.html\\\" is not available. I am guessing either they didn\\'t include the full URL for a web page, or neglected to include the \\\"about\\\" page in the download package.  2) The \\\"ADHD wiki\\\" link goes to a Psoriasis Wiki link.  3) \\\"ADHD: Research Updates\\\" goes to an Acne Research link.  4) ADHD Clinical Trials, Events, Forums, Podcasts, and Research all point to the correct pages, but with a popup offering a free game download. News points to the Forums page, with the same popup.",
