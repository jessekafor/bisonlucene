FYI, this will not save picture notifications. Just text and list :)Android Beam support! Tap on a notification (regular text only) to edit, but tap to another NFC-enabled phone to beam that notification right into the notification bar of the other phone!Create notifications hands-free with VoiceNotif! Just tap the microphone icon at the top and it will listen for a title and your content. It will create an expandable notification, just as if you typed it out yourself.Note: Updating the application will erase notifications. Sorry! I am working on a way around this.Note: If you are using a Sense device (HTC One X, for example), the UI will not expand any notifications except for the highest one. I cannot control this at all.

My only complaint is the app icon! Bring back the cube, it looks so much nicer on my main home screen! :)",

I had to get the pro for the additional features because I was using it so much. I asked for reminders and got it. In the list editing it would be neat if items can be crossed out once they are done (for shopping lists) But even without that it is still an amazing app. Good UI but I personally liked the old logo more. But it would be really harsh if I gave the app anything less than 5 stars.",

        "comment": "History is good, however it should be searchable. After a while you will have a huge history if you make lots of reminders. Also, would like a way to export the history somehow. (would really like to see this functionality)  App needs a more polish. I create a note  with reminder for 8/14/2013 and the reminder confirmation dialog says reminder set for 7/14/2013.  App should let you pick a default icon, or better yet a quick selection of maybe 4 or 9 icons (2x2 grid or 3x3 grid).   Inconsistent behavior when you tap on a notification. When you tap a text notification, a system dialog pops up (to edit). When you tap a list notification, it takes you to the app to edit. Should pick one or the other (I prefer app)  Giving this app 4 stars, it has potential to be a great reminder app",

I kind of really wish I hadn\\'t updated the app in the most recent one, because I wasn\\'t having issues really before that.
