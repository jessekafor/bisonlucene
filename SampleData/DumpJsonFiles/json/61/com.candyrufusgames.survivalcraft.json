    "description": "You are marooned on the shores of an infinite blocky world. Explore, mine resources, craft tools and weapons, hunt, make traps and grow plants. Build a shelter to survive nights and share your worlds online. Ride horses or camels and herd cattle. Blast your way through the rock with explosives. Build complex electric devices. Possibilities are infinite in this sandbox survival and construction game.This is the twenty third release of Survivalcraft, and it adds new survival mechanics, such as hunger and stamina! You can till soil and grow your own food from seeds. A large number of new animals have been introduced, such as orcas, zebras, lions, rhinos, and more. The animals now use pathfinding to locate their goals and prey. Boats allow you to visit remote islands far out in the ocean.Survivalcraft brings features you love in the PC version of Minecraft to your mobile device: infinite worlds, caves, logic elements (electricity), weather, boats, and many more. It does so while maintaining its own realistic, survival-themed style.Enjoy!Website: http://kaalus.wordpress.com",

        "comment": "This is the game that lets you get your Minecraft on with a mobile device, free from the 256x256 prison of the Pocket Edition. Unbounded world, actual 3x3 crafting, and much more feature-rich than MCPE\\'s current version. It still lacks a lot of things to make it comparable to Minecraft on PC, such as armor and bows, but the developer is always actively working to improve it - rideable horses and camels were added just a week ago. It also eschews Minecraft\\'s fantasy elements - there\\'s no alternate dimension,",
