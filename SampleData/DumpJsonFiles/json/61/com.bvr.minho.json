His family consists of his mother, father and one older sister. As a young child, Min-ho hoped to become a football (soccer) player, but an injury in the 5th grade of elementary school put an end to his dream. Min-ho, however, still keeps up with football and has stated that Cristiano Ronaldo is his favorite player.In his second year of high school, Min-ho turned to acting. By his senior year in high school he had joined Starhaus Entertainment with the help of an acquaintance. After going through training, Min-ho started auditioning and landed small roles in several television dramas. In 2006, his acting career was put on hold for a year following a serious car accident in which he was severely injured. Childhood friend and fellow actor Jung Il-woo was also injured in the accident.His breakthrough came in 2009 with the lead role of Gu Jun-pyo in Boys Over Flowers (KBS2), the Korean adaptation of the popular Japanese television drama Hana Yori Dango, which was based on the popular ShÅjo manga, Boys Over Flowers (è±ããç·å­ Hana Yori Dango). Min-ho is majoring in Film & Art at Konkuk University.In 2010 Lee followed up the success of Boys Over Flowers by staring in the MBC TV drama Personal Taste in which he played a ambitious perfectionist young architect who poses as a gay man to become roommates with a young woman leading to romantic complications. When asked about why he chose the role during an interview he responded \"I think I would do a better job playing heavy and more defined roles when I am older. I think \"Personal Taste\" was perfect because it is bright, cheerful but you can also laugh and cry over it as well.\" The series received above average ratings.In 2011, he starred in the hit action drama City Hunterwith actress and model Park Min Young. The drama's popularity throughout Asia has also contributed to Min-ho's growing popularity in Asia, most notably in Japan, Philippines and China. He took the number one spot for Best Hallyu Star in a Japanese magazine dedicated to Korean dramas in June of 2012.On April 6, 2012, Min-ho announced on his Facebook page that he would appear in a new drama called Faith (Hangul: ì ì, Rom.: Shinui), which aired from August to October 2012 in Korea.Tags : Lee Min ho, Live Wallpaper, Wallpaper, Korean Actor, Korea",
