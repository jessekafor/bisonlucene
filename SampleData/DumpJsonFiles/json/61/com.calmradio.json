We're in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and it's a place that cries out for calm. Best wishes for a happy and bright Christmas season. K Van Der Stoep***** This collection of music and your service is one of the best 'things' that ever happened in my life. 40 years of practicing medicine has left its imprint on my psyche...'wound up like a $2 watch' might be an apt descriptor. You help that. Thank you. M Daly***** You amaze me! You keep finding ways to improve. I love the new channel menu as well as the many new channels. Eric Harry & Calm Radio you just keep getting better! I think this is the first time I've ever written two letters of appreciation to a company. I can't help it. You keep getting better. You are the most welcome part of my work day. Thanks! Maggie A.***** Just letting you know we're getting Calm Radio crystal clear down here in the beautiful Golden Bay area of the South Island of New Zealand. I love the music stream and have just signed up for a 12 month VIP subscription. Ken***** Spa/ambient channel is the best! Has helped me a great deal with my anxiety. Gena from Lodi CA***** THANK YOU! - for everything... can't tell you what a difference \"CalmRadio\" has made - it has saved my sanity these past few weeks - especially the \"SLEEP\" channel has - helped met to cope and find moments of peace.***** I have to say that I am still amazed at your near instantaneous response! I have never had ANYONE answer a support request in such a timely - but more importantly, personal - and HELPFUL - manner! Nancy***** You're my parrot's favorite station when I'm away at work! Carrie..Portland OR***** Thank you a million times over for your radio station. Every type of music that I absolutely love is available any where I am at any time. You have to be the very best provider of music anywhere. Carol Lee***** This is the best \"music to work by\" that I have found! I'm an at-home \"virtual lawyer\". D. Scardilli, Absecon NJ",

        "comment": "-This app is indeed very good when it decides to work.  The music selection is very impressive but sometimes  you don\\'t know what are you listening  ( maybe needs a notification icon ?).  -The audio quality is decent, and is better when  you have a subscription.  - The interface needs a new style, the actual is very cheap.  At the end you will be loving this radio station, despite the random crashes.",

Calm Radio has the best selection of any similar app but still needs work. Put an icon in the Status Bar to remind you its running and make it easy to access. Separate basic controls (volume, timer, play/pause) from all that FB/Twitter button junk. Control buttons w/ white indicators should never have white backgrounds. Add an indicator that tells you a stream is loading not stalled. Close to great.",
