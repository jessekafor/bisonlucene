        "comment": "This app is so great for figuring out debt payment strategy but it lacks one major thing - the ability to change payment frequency. I pay many bills weekly or biweekly. To surpass this, I multiplied the amount by 52 or 26 and divded by 12 but I would prefer the option to change payment frequency and to see what impact changing my monthly payments to weekly or bieeekly would have. Otherwise, I found this app very useful and easy to use.",

So you cannot plan ahead. 3. Need per debt\\'s monthly transaction report showing for each month the payment, pre-payments, interest and balance.",
