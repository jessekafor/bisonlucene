    "description": "Parking Challenge 3D brings you two game modes in 3D perspective view. Drive and park 4 different vehicles from a standard saloon to a large bus with realistic physics, through turns and bends without bumping into objects and pavement. If you fancy something even more challenging then try the Xtreme 4x4 mode. There is no road, The goal is to get the 4x4 Jeep from the start point to finish without falling off, see if you have the nerves to try.",

        "comment": "I played the lite version and I enjoyed it,  so I decided to purchase the full version and it\\'s worth it but I noticed that there are bugs such as in some levels,  you can easily get 3 stars as long as you manage to park it inside the target area even though the car is not properly aligned and in some cases you will quickly get rewarded once the front part of your vehicle reaches the top  part of the target area. Also at lvl 24, there\\'s a bug that disables the bus from moving once it bumps its middle part.",
