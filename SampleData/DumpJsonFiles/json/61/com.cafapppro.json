        "comment": "...you need to find out yourself the information about caffeine eg. what\\'s the optimal level before unwanted side effects.  Graphs could have default/customizable information lines that you could activate, like \\\"get your caffeine level this low before 22:00\\\" or \\\"Shake hands time!\\\" or \\\"Blood pressure high enough for you?\\\". Not as an encouragement but so that you could try to avoid those caffeine levels.  Finnish cup of coffee has about 0,9mg/ml so I tried to edit the standard Coffee -drink from the drink menu. I found out that there\\'s no editing option so I had to just make new one and delete the old one.  Also have you considered the fact that caffeine probably takes also time to get in to your system? You could think adding an little side option for \\\"condensation\\\" notifications. It would be cool if my phone reminded me to drink more water, not just less coffee. :D   You have and great app going on here, I hope you have the time to develop it more inviting and user friendly!",
