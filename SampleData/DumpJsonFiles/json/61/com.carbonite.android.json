        "comment": "I had been using Carbonite for nearly 3 years. Despite being underwhelmed with the throttled (slow) backup speed, overall, I was satisfied with how it was working. Ultimately, you purchase a service like this in the hopes that you never really have to use it. By that, I mean, you hope you never lose your files or have a need to restore them. Well, that dreaded day came for me where my hard drive crashed & I lost all of my files. At that point, I was very glad that I had all (200 + gigabytes) of my files backed up to Carbonite. Unfortunately, this is where it all went wrong.    Not only did the restore take way too long, the desktop application also had many problems. For starters, I could only restore 2 \\342\\200\\223 3 gigabytes a day. I was told by Carbonite that some of their customers are able to restore up to 18 gigabytes a day. I can tell you first hand, don\\342\\200\\231t believe that! I can also tell you that the slow download speeds had nothing to do with my internet bandwidth. I have a DSL fiber-optic ISP with a constant 40 + Mbps connection; so, the bandwidth is there. It was so bad, I resorted to manually downloading my files directly from their website.",
