    "description": "BACKSTORYYou are Seth Serrenson, former mercenary and now a ward of the Viscountess Bayette D'Lasio. She provides you with free room and board in exchange for your services: You are attempting to uncover the truth about who it is that murdered her husband.Lately, though, your services have taken a different turn. You have been tasked with retaliating against goblins, whose raids on the nearby villages have become more frequent.So, armed with only your favorite hand-axe, you move in on a group of goblins to save a small town currently under attack.That's where our story begins.GAME PLAYGame play involves some action and fighting, but some of it is also problem-solving (read: puzzles and riddles). I tried to code the game so that casual gamers can complete it, but hardcore gamers can opt for the challenge of getting a higher score by killing more goblins in challenging environments. Most of the combat play should be fairly intuitive. The axe icon represents Seth's axe, and it is the only weapon he will use in this game. You have to, of course, be in close proximity to an enemy to successfully hit him when you attack him.The joystick on the left controls movement. There is also a jump button (the one that looks like a foot).Please note that there are also \"dialogue trees\" in this game. People who play RPGs regularly will know all about this. You will be having a conversation with someone in the game, and you will be presented with options for your part of the dialogue. You can pick any one of the options BUT YOU MUST PICK ONE. Simply touch the option to select it.I put some code in place to prevent the camera from going through the walls in the dungeon.  It works about 70-80% of the time. When it does work, it simply zooms in on the back of Seth's head. This is just to prevent the camera from going outside of the dungeon.  Sometimes it doesn't work, and I'll look at that for the next game. If this is received fairly well, I'll go ahead and crank out a sequel. I already have the outline for that in mind.As usual, I cut corners as much as possible to get under Google's 50Mb limit. And we just barely made it this time!Any issues, feel free to drop me an email.",
