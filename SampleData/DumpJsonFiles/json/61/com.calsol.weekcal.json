        "comment": "The updates are getting better.   New widget is really nice, I just wish it were smaller. You can resize it down to 3x2 but it looks odd. The buttons on the side take up too much space at that size and it would be nice if the current  date button stayed on at that size. 2x2 widget in the new style with buttons on the side would be amazing.  The only consistent bug I have noticed is that all-day events show up on the previous day in the widget.  Getting better :-)",

        "comment": "I don\\'t understand how one app from iOS can be so poor on the android. I thought it showed promise when they added mini month but it\\'s so buggy and unappealing to the eye. This looks more like a beta version than an app that should be on the market. I\\'m continuing to keep my fingers crossed since I used this app everyday for years when I had the iPhone.",
