        "comment": "I just downloaded this and it\\'s the most glitchy app I\\'ve ever encountered. Using the back button on the phone makes you reenter your pin, so every glitch when I needed to just go back one screen made me reenter my pin. It\\'s not syncing. Adding my other apps was a challenge because I would get a blank white screen, and want sure it had added. Overall, a good idea but it doesn\\'t work smoothly at all.",

Home screen of app is not comprehensive. On making goal for weight loss of 3500 calories it doesn\\'t take simple data of calories deficits from lose it. I would prefer to add exercise manually in lose it rather.",
