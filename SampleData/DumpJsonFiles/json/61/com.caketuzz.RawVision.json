        "comment": "On a recent holiday, I took a tablet and this app, instead of my laptop and Lightroom. For cranking out a quick jpeg with a few adjustments, this was great. My only criticism (author, please advise if I missed something here) is that my Sony\\'s raw files could not be extracted to a full resolution jpeg... even setting the extract option to zero which supposedly meant a full size jpeg would be created, did not do so. Largest jpeg I could get was 1080 px. But given that I just wanted jpegs to send to social media, this wasn\\'t a deal breaker. For others, it might be. Ymmv. In all, really happy with raw vision. Thanks.",
