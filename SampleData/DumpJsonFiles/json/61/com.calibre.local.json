    "description": "Update: Refactored! If you are using 2.3.3 and up you should see improvements and speed boost as well as a better over all layout. I will be ending support for 2.3.3 devices in general and will now move new updates to the app itself to jellybean and higher devices.  ***DESCRIPTION:If you are like me, you like to carry your books on your device, and if you have many books chances are you use calibre. Leger calibre makes it possible to view your nice calibre library on your device!Leger calibre includes: *Support for multiple calibre libraries in device.*Viewing of all tags, authors, and series and displaying all books with any particular tag, authors, and series.*searching your library*Viewing book information: title, author, publisher, tags, comments.*Viewing recently opened books.*Option to open books with your favorite viewer with the option to choose formats, e.g., pdf, djvu, cbz, cbr, epub, etc... (you must have the appropriate viewer of course)The name: Leger in Latin means \"to read\", this app reads calibre (whose name contains \"libre\" meaning freedom). Basically it reads information you wrote in calibre for viewing.I will try to update it and clean it up, specially with enough support and positive feedback, with that said:Please report any issues and allow me time to consider them before you post negative comments, Thanks!Note: Long Clicking on library produces a list of things one can do. If, say, you added books to library you can reflect those changes by selecting the option \"Refresh\".**Addressing common issues and comments: A) Please do NOT use the calibre sync feature. I repeat DO NOT USE CALIBRE SYNC. The sync option was not intended for this app.B) It seems that one of the most requested features is LAN support. That feature is currently not in the works--Please keep in mind this is a free app. There does seem to be paid app that offers that feature and would recommend you investigate that option if it's a make it or break it feature for you. Enjoy!****Finally, I want to thank all calibre developers, your work ROCKS! *****",

        "title": "Excellent on a tablet when combined with Dropsync",
        "comment": "This is an excellent app - very straight forward and very useful.  A good setup for using it is the following: On your computer run a copy of Calibre and place your entire library inside a Dropbox folder. Purchase the Dropsync app (which causes full syncing to your tablet) and synchronise to a folder you create on your SD card. Finally launch Leger Calibre and allow the library to be found automatically. After every update, refresh your library within Leger Calibre to see changes.  This allows you to access your entire Calibre library offline, but manage the library on your computer.",

        "comment": "I carry two devices, and this app lets me host my calibre catalogue, minus books, on my android tablet and use it to search my books by tags, author, title etc and then proceed to read the book on my ereader on an e-ink screen with huge battery life rather than a backlit screen with relatively low battery life (which tends to give me a headache). In other words it\\'s useful when I\\'m on the move and need to search my calibre library, but don\\'t have or want network access to use the calibre content server.",
