(HERO2 only).Although we try to optimise this as much as possible, the video stream has a short delay. This is partly due to how the camera compresses the videostream, which is something we cannot influence. This app is build by observing the original GoPro network protocol. As we have no influence on future firmware versions, we can only guarantee compatibility with the following firmware versions:- HD HERO2 Firmware version 8.12.222 + Wi-Fi BacPac version 3.4.1- HD HERO3 Firmware version 02.39The protocol is unlikely to change, but if it does, we will try to update the compatibility.Designed for use with GOPROÂ® products.
