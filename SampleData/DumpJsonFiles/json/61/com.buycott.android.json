We can\\'t always see barcodes, this would help workaround remaining bugs, and it would also help with devices that have no away camera for which the app is currently disabled.",

I officially tried it out for the first time today, and much to my dismay, found out that Honest Tea is a subsidiary of Coca-Cola, which I would have never known before using this app.  So now I know I have to be more cautious than before with products I buy.    I haven\\'t had an issue at all with the scanning of product codes, and the first time I tried it out, I actually Googled a Coca-Cola bar code on my wife\\'s phone, and it even scanned that one accurately.    So far I haven\\'t run into any bugs or conflicting reports with what I\\'ve scanned.  The only thing I wish this app had would be a search feature, and that\\'s the only reason I\\'m giving it four stars.  Once they implement that feature, I\\'ll give it five stars.",
