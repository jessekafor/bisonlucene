        "comment": "For a monthly plan (probably the same for no-monthly plan), when they calculate the fee, they apply 1.95% to each sales transaction amount and round up the fee to bring up the fee, e.g. 5.01 cents => 6 cents. On the average if you have two hundred transactions, this adds up to $1.00 daily. This is absolutely against the basic accounting practice and is cheating merchants.  Why not round off or apply the rate once to the total of daily transactions? \\302\\240I complained about it, so far no change. I think they are doing this intentionally, not by mistake. Please be honest.",

        "comment": "Spark Pay is a good system and has the lowest credit card processing fee rate that we have found around. It has very nice features on customizing the receipt, it is very quick and easy to use once you get the hang of it. The major problems as it relates to us are: 1- limited Multi User functionality. Currently there is only one level of access.  We need to have multiple users be able to use the system, which it does allow now. However we want to be able to limit the other users to see their own transactions only. We don\\'t want someone possibly void someone else\\'s transaction.  So we really like to see a \\'manager\\' level userid which can see and manage all of the transactions and users, and then we like to see a \\'user\\' level userid which can only charge the cards, see their own transactions and possibly Void their own transactions. We don\\'t want users to be able to Refund credit cards. 2- We want the \\'manager\\' userid to get all of the emails when users use the app and charge credit cards. currently only the users can get emails on their own transactions. This is useless to us.  If it wasn\\'t for these two major issues , we would give this app 4.5 stars.",
