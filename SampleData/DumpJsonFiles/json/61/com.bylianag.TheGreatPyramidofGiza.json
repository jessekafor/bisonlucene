    "description": "The Great Pyramid of Giza Wallpapers and Theme ApplicationThe Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis bordering what is now El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb for fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BCE. Initially at 146.5 metres, the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.This app will add a few search access points on your device.
