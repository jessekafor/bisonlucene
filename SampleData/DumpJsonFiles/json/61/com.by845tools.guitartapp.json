        "comment": "In this app I can edit, transpose, see chords, customize the look and upload my own songs. I have GT on my Lenovo ThinkPad tablet and it works great. The only thing that needs improving is when using ChordPro sometimes it takes several swipes to advance the page. On occasion it won\\'t swipe at all. Two of my friends in our band have OnSong on their iPads and if they hadn\\'t already purchased that app they would switch to GT.",
