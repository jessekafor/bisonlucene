        "comment": "Set up a zone to know when the kid is home from school, our primary use for the app.  This feature works very well.  The only problem I have found with the app is when our family is traveling in the same vehicle, all of our phones continuously alert that our group is in the same zone.  This quickly gets annoying and drains battery.  Hiding ourself from the group ceases the constant alerts but also stops updating locations.  Have emailed developer for suggestions.",

        "comment": "Fab. Track the missus or just wait for the zone alert before cooking dinner. Make sure the kids are safe on long journeys without having to rely on them texting. Set zones up when out so your partner knows you have arrived at zones like station and then work. Used for approximately 6 weeks. Love it. More importantly so does the other half.",

Either make your app truly free or change your description to reflect its actual use under free and add-ons  Update:  Again I am not against an app making money and by all means try to avoid ads (ads = death) but your description should clearly state what is possible with your app (free version) and then list out what may require fees.",
