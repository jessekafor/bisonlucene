        "comment": "App is easy and convenient to use. My only complaint about it is that it shuts down when you receive a phone call or text message and doesn\\'t save where you are in the run. So you have to stop running, restart the program, and fast forward through the workout until you get back to the place you were. I have discovered though if I put my phone on airplane mode it won\\'t do this, but then you can\\'t use any gps programs to map the run. I would give it 5 stars if the program stayed running in the background.",
