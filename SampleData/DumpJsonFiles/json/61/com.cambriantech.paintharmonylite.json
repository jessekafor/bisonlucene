        "comment": "Another paint app that has started on good legs but slightly misses the mark. Easy enough to navigate and straight forward, wider bar is a tad sensitive as you end up off a color completely rathe quickly. Again didn\\'t find away to see if two colors worked well together. Over all an ok app with room to improve.",

Another clue?  Perhaps.  I needed to match a color that I have in my home.   I scanned the color just fine.  I was excited to see what paint it would match with as I have my shoes on - ready to go out the door and buy paint.  However, onceI scanned the color, then the ap became utterly useless.  I figured I must have been doing something wrong.  You know...missing a setting or a button.  Something like that.  So, off to the developer\\'s website.  I got a fun little message.  Something about \\\"This is embarrassing...but we can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for. However, if you would like to download a paid version of our ap, here\\'s a link.\\\"  You scumbags!",
