The simplest photoreceptors in conscious vision connect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.",

        "comment": "After reading on my phone for just about forever, I used the free version, and it really helped relieve my sore eyes. They feel a ton better now.  ^-^  Also, as a suggestion, how about something that would prompt people if they have glasses or contacts (thinking that a good amount of people using this app probably have them), and if they did, add in a new exercise or too, or have a few new variations like \\\"Glasses on, glasses off\\\" and something similar for contacts.",

It would be great, however, to implement some kind of \\\"silent\\\" mode, when the app will simply vibrate (i.e. twice when you need to do something WITHIN the exercise and four times when you need to move to the next one) instead of \\\"saying\\\" something... Other than that - keep up the good work:)))",
