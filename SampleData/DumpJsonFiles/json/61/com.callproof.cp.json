        "comment": "I\\'ll have to admit, when I first downloaded this app, I thought it was great. In fact, I orginally gave it 5 stars. I spoke too soon though. As far as the app goes it\\'s great. But here is what I didn\\'t like. My dad gave me the HTC EVO I have as a gift a few weeks ago. I have not had it activated yet so it still has his number as the cell number logged in the phone. Apparently, they used information from my phone I wasn\\'t aware of and using it to make follow-up and sales calls on the app to my dad who lives in Virginia. I\\'m in Ohio. He received a phone call from Tennessee from someone. He texted asking who it was and this was the reply:  REP: Yes, this is XXX with Calc Horoid, are you busy this morning?   First of all, who and what is Calc Horoid? Then they texted back saying...  REP: I meant CallProof...  What the ### is going on??? First your calling someone who doesn\\'t know anything about you. Then you can\\'t even get the name of the product right. And there is more to that text, but bottom line is, after that episode... UNINSTALLED! My dad was upset with me because he assumed I had given his phone number out to businesses. So I had to straighten this crap out.",
