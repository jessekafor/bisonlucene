    "description": "ActiGraph is an Android application that uses your phone's built-in motion sensor to monitor your daily levels of physical activity. This app is designed to help you stay active and to prevent the health problems brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, which include an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and reduced life expectancy.Use ActiGraph to set your desired amount of physical activity per day and the app will keep track of whether or not you achieve your daily goal. You can view a live diagram of your activity levels and a chart that shows your stats for the current day. You can also see how well you are meeting your long-term health goals by viewing your activity-level history for the preceding weeks and months.If your daily routine involves long stretches of sitting, you should enable the ActiGraph Inactivity Alarm. When it's enabled, ActiGraph will sound an alarm after a specified period of inactivity to remind you that your body needs some physical movement.Sedentary lifestyle is a patient and determined killer. It can cause your body to grow weak and your health to deteriorate without your noticing. The only sure way to prevent this from happening is to make the effort every day to get an adequate amount of physical activity at regular intervals. ActiGraph is here to help you stay active and healthy.",

        "comment": "This app does a good job of  monitoring physical activity and setting alarms to avoid the very real health risk of sitting around all day. The small widget is very functional and unobtrusive. One small point, the back button keeps trying to restart the program which is already running. Instead it should exit, with program running in the background. The program does continue to run in the background with the screen off on my Nexus 4.  I don\\'t know yet about the effect on battery life.",
