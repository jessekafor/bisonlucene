    "description": "Nut Warz is an action-packed side-scroller, complete with multiple levels, minigames and puzzles. Utilize the touch-screen and motion controls of the mobile devices to navigate through the game. Join Sammy the Squirrel in his adventure to find and save his golden nutz. Battle your way past birds, snakes and bees with an arsenal at your disposal. Blast enemies with your high-powered laser rifle and evade dangerous obstacles with your helicopter jet-pack. The more nutz you collect, the better your score will be. A higher score will unlock more options in your final puzzle challenge to save Sammy's nutz. Design and development: Przemyslaw J.
