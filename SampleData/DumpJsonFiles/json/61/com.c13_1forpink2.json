On the last day of this app you run for 4min & walk 1min... 26x. If you really want to train to run a half marathon this is NOT the app for you. Save your money!",

I have no problem hearing voice cues over my music. I use MOG - and both apps run fine together on my HTC Droid Incredible -no glitches, ample battery life.  Great looking interface, and simple to use. You need to be able to jog or race walk for 3 minute intervals starting with first workout - 45 minute total workout duration week 1 day 1.",
