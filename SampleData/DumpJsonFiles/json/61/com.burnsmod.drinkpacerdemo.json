    "description": "Avoid hangovers with Drinkpacer! DrinkPacer uses a well-known blood-alcohol estimation to track your drunkenness and help stop you from drinking past your limits. You tell the app every time you finish a drink (a beer, glass of wine, or single shot of spirits) and it tracks your drunkenness and helps keep you in the zone. After all, the night is a marathon, not a race.This app is intended for entertainment purposes only and does not provide true blood alcohol calculating functionality.",
