When you press âPlayâ the attacking army starts moving, each attacker at its own predetermined pace. You have a different army at each level with different capabilities that need to conquer the castle. The castle is defended by an army that changes from level to level. You need to adapt your attack to the defending army. You have 60 seconds to get everyone into the castle or you lose the battle.Combat Rules:Each army is composed of 6 different character types: Soldier, Warrior, Knight, Archer, Horseman and Magician. To eliminate a defending Knight from the playfield you have to attack it with a Knight. To eliminate a defending Horseman from the playfield you have to attack it with a Horseman and so on. If you attack a defending Soldier with a Warrior they will fight and retreat. Move the attackers by touching them and swiping in the direction it is supposed to go. Thereâs no need to eliminate the whole defending army before conquering the castle, you only need to get past it and reach the castle gate.

        "title": "Boring, needs more work",
        "comment": "The game is lacking any explanations, you can either play or train but none of them seem to explain what to do. From the little i did understand, the game seems boring, and I couldn\\'t fully understand which enemies you can hit and which you can\\'t, as it differs greatly between the first two training levels. Lastly, it\\'s very annoying that a single press on the back button exits the game without asking you or returning to main menu. Fix those small bugs, add a tutorial and the game will already look better",
