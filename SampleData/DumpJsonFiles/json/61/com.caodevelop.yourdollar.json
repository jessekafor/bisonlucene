        "comment": "The app has pretty good graphics and doesn\\'t look cheaply executed, and it\\'s a nice idea overall. However you can\\'t do much else. There\\'s only a $1 bill option, you can\\'t pick from your gallery (only pic taken at the moment), and no front-facing camera option (which makes it hard to fit your face in the small hole without a mirror in front of you). It also gets boring fast, uninstalled in less than 5 min.",
