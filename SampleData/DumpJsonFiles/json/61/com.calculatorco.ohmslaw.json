Only two of the field should be â checked at one time. For the equations to work two of the four variables need to be known and entered correctly.  âStep 1: Enter a known variable into a field. Insure that the metric prefix is correct as this can greatly affect the equations outcomes. The field should turn green.   âStep 2: Enter the second known variable into a field. Again, insure that the metric prefix is correct and the field should turn green.   âStep 3: The remaining fields will turn blue and will contain the correct solutions.âNote: If three variables are â checked they will turn red and wait for one to be unchecked to continue.FAQQ: What equations does ohms law calculator follow?A: This ohms law app follows the standard ohms law triangle and the power triangle. Q: How do I add more significant digits to my results?A: To add more than the default three digits add zeros to the end of your inputs (ie, 3.2300) and the results will match the inputs significant digits.
