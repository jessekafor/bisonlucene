    "description": "The application is about calling (and texting) for help when you are going through a dark or a possibly an unsafe place. Hoping that you are getting phone signal, instead of fidgeting with your phone to dial 911 (or number of a loved one) and keeping your thumb on the \"Call\" button, why not have an application where there is a big fat button that when released calls your choice of (previously saved) number or pull up 911 dial screen.http://www.amanjeev.com/2009/12/16/a-very-simple-android-application-for-safety/Source code: https://github.com/amanjeev/CallHelp/blob/master/src/com/help/Call.java",
