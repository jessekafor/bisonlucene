    "description": "NO push notificationsNO spyware NO malwareFREE BONUS - cracked glass and squashed mosquitoes backgroundsThe Capricorn is probably the most responsible sign in the Zodiac. The people born in the sign of Capricorn like everything done on time â and everything done in the right way. Well, to be more precise, in the way theyâve been told to do it. Capricorns are not very imaginative, even though they can be quite resourceful on times. They are ambitious and patient, and take criticism quite well â as long as itâs from someone whoâs âsuperiorâ to them.They are conceited, but very, very loyal â and make some very good friends. A Capricorn is always there for whoever needs them to be, even if they are not sure exactly what to do in the given situation. For a person born in this sign, itâs always helpful to have some form of instructions, or at least someone telling them how to do things. Once theyâve been told, however, they do them in the most perfect way possible.The Capricorn live wallpaper adds a moving Capricorn sign to your background â one nice reminder that, if youâre a Capricorn, of course, youâre one of those people who can do the job a perfectly as possible. A nice reminder for those around you as well â in case they ever need someone like you.After the download you don't need internet connection to enjoy the application.
