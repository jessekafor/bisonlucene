    "description": "Spartacus Blood and Sand PuzzleSpartacus: Blood and Sand is the title of the first and most critically acclaimed season of Spartacus, an American television series that premiered on Starz on January 22, 2010. The series was inspired by the historical figure of Spartacus (played by Andy Whitfield), a Thracian gladiator who from 73 to 71 BC led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Executive producers Steven S. DeKnight and Robert Tapert focused on structuring the events of Spartacus' obscure early life leading up to the beginning of historical records.The show stars Andy Whitfield and has been rated TV-MA for graphic violence, strong sexual content, and coarse language.This game contains the best pictures of your favorite theme.
