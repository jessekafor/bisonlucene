        "comment": "I bought the app and for one reason or another it didn\\'t work. Contacted the company and my problem was resolved within 24 hours. To top it up I didn\\'t like the display so they sent me a custom app with the way I like to see my orders. No the app is perfect and does everything I need. Brilliant company to do Business with and I will highly recommend them.  from Parrot Essentials.",
