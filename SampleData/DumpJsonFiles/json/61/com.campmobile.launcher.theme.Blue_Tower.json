What are these icons even representing? This is the most perplexing theme presentation e.v.e.r. I just get no theme vibe from this at all.  So. I say it\\'s not a theme here. Its more like a demented crypto-treasure map, leading only to my certain and unspeakable demise. From that axe even.   (I love it)     \\342\\206\\222  kate",
