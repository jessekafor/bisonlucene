    "description": "This is Chapter 4 in the series entitled \"The Life And Times Of Seth Serrenson\". Chapters 1-3 are as follows:1. Halls Of The Goblin Lords2. The Terror Of The Troll Witch3. \"If I Whet My Glittering Sword\"All 3 of the previous chapters are available on Google Play and are free. This chapter can be played as a stand-alone game, or enjoyed as part of the larger role-playing experience.BACK STORY[Warning: Spoilers are below for people who have not played the first 3 chapters!]An innocent man. You just killed an innocent man.His name was Barnen. The mayor of Westmoreland, who happens to be Barnen's uncle, sent you to him as a diversion. The mayor, Kjen Jaren, was actually the culprit behind the poisoning of the well at Westmoreland, but he led you to believe it was Barnen.When you confronted Barnen, he challenged you to a duel in an effort to defend his honor. He lost the fight but kept his honor. You now know that he was innocent.At the end of the duel, your old friend Kaysa the druid showed up and gave you nothing but bad news: Pretty much everyone in the realm wants to kill you. Also: the well at Westmoreland was successfully poisoned, and Kjen framed you for the foul deed.The only lead you now have is the one given to you by Barnen before you killed him. He said that he was searching for the Dwarf Supremacists in the ruins of Kirt because two of their members had tried (unsuccessfully) to kill Kjen a couple of weeks earlier. Barnen wanted to find out why.Now you get to find out why. Our story picks up with you entering the ruins of Kirt in search of the Dwarf Supremacists - who happen to not only be rogues but racist rogues. They believe that dwarves are the supreme race, and have been known to kill people for committing the \"crime\" of not being dwarves.But will the cabal of rogues give you the answers that you need, or will they kill you on the spot...?GAME PLAYThings get more interesting here. In this game, you learn some rogue-like skills. You will learn sneak, ventriloquism, and backstab-like maneuver which I refer to as \"the gut\". You'll also get a chance to practice your new skills.Other than that, combat is the same as in previous games. The axe icon is what you use to strike. Just make sure that you are facing your enemy and close enough to hit. The foot icon is for jumping. Movement is controlled by the transparent joystick on the lower, left-hand side.DEVELOPER NOTESOnce again, I struggled to keep it under 50Mb. And, once again, even with the struggle I made it happen. I had some problems with grass textures on the opening scene, which is why you don't see a whole lot of that. But hey, it's a desert environment so a whole lot of grass would be out place, wouldn't it?There are still a few tweaks that I would like to make for the next release. There are some combat issues that I would like to get cleaned up, and sometimes drinking a healing potion in the middle of combat can cause the animation to go haywire. Those are tough to reproduce, but I'll look at them.",
