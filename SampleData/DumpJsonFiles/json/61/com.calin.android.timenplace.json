    "description": "Upon triggering a reminder, the app can:- play a ringtone- play an audio recording that you have made within the app- speak a text you provide (talking is available only on phones that have text to speech libraries installed. Some languages require third party libraries; you can find them on Android Market)- show a reminder text- show a system notification - vibrateThe app was designed to run in the background and use as little user interface as possible. Internet connection is used to show the map and to resolve street addresses based on selected points on the map. Once the reminders are set there will be no Internet activity.You can use the app in airplane mode or on devices that are not cell phones as long as they have GPS. Some phones may not work well in airplane mode due to their hardware design.",
