    "description": "Cardcloud is the only business card you'll ever need.Log into your existing Cardcloud account or sign up directly by creating your first card. You can do this by selecting your existing contact information from your phone's address book, or by entering the info manually.Cardcloud allows you to create multiple cards. This way, you can have share info with business contacts, or rather have a personal card to send out. Freelancers working for multiple companies can create as many cards as they want. You can edit contact information, profile pictures, logos, and social networking profiles for each card you create.Recipients donât have to have Cardcloud installed on their phone. You can send your card directly to an email address, and Cardcloud will deliver a beautifully formatted card directly to the recipient's inbox. You can also beam your card directly to other Cardcloud users in the vicinity, and store contact information on your phoneâs address book.Cardcloud allows you to remember more about your new contacts. For each exchange, information is stored about the person you met. Remember who you met when, where and how. See where you met. Add a note. Was it at a conference, or perhaps a trade fair? Cardcloud takes your cards to the next level.",

        "comment": "I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and when I try to add Linked In as a social service, I get the error that certain symbols cannot be used.  The problem is that the basic Linked In username is your email address which everyone\\'s email contains the \\\"@\\\" symbol.    Also, I cannot seem to add a picture to the business card using the phone app.  I can only add it using the web application.    Finally, since each field is not tagged, when sharing the card with business associates, all the information does not appear in their contact manager, such as Outlook.  The phone numbers do not transfer over.  In order for this to work, I believe each field must be tagged with business, mobile, home, etc, for outlook to assign the number.",

However, now I get an error: \\\"Cardcloud can\\'t connect to the internet right now.\\\" This happens despite being connected 4G. The bigger problem is the lack of response from Cloudcard support in trying to resolve it.  So a non-working app gets 1 star.",
