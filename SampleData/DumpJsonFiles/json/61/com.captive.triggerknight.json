Humble opinion: need more weapons/armor and more variety - maybe after 20 levels you get the option of running in another (harder) world with different equips and monsters. Would also love to see more movements on the sprites, and also the option of buying new character with the exp you collect. Finally, the different equips should be visible on the characters.",
