    "description": "Are you poop shy?  This app can help you become comfortable on the crapper.  Simply play the sound in a stall.  You can easily become acclimated to the embarrassment because its not actually you in the act.  Then, simply transition into using the app while you do your business, and eventually learn to poop in public restrooms by yourself!  Yay!",
