Scanning bar codes and keeping track of everything is fast and easy. I managed to check off everything in my kitchen in about 15 minutes. I am a bachelor without a ton of food but it was really simple. Now when I shop based on recipes I have, I will know what I have and what I need.",

Give it automatic backup (weekly would be nice) or at least a reminder to do it each week.",
