    "description": "âââ Designed for both Android tablets and phones âââTracker2Go is an easy to use and comprehensive diet app that can help you take control of your weight. Tracker2Go includes access to a large database of over 98,000 food items with no online memberships required or ongoing subscription fees. â Full international support Tracker2Go can work in pounds, kilos or stones and accepts user measurements in feet and inches or meters. When adding products you can work with standard serving sizes, grams, ounces, kilos and more. Would you prefer to work with calories or kiloJoules? You decide. The international food database contains products for countries throughout the world including US, Canada, UK, Europe, Australasia and more. All entries in our database are reviewed by humans to maintain the highest possible degree of accuracy and quality and avoid duplicates. â No internet connection requiredTracker2Go can work with,  and without an internet connection.  When you are 'offline' the app lets you add items from its local database which includes a comprehensive core food database.  When you are back online the app offers to expand the search to the internet to get full access to all available products.  All items retrieved during an internet search are also added to the offline database so the more you use the app, the more products become available when offline!This creates both a useful,  and useable offline database of products you consume.â Smart search The smart search learns as you use it, the more you use the app the quicker it gets, bringing products you have used before to the top of search results and correcting common spelling mistakes to help you find what you are really looking for. â Create a personal diet plan Let Tracker2Go suggest a personal diet plan based on your current situation and the targets you want to achieve. â Track what you eat with the food diary Track your diet adding items you eat or drink to the food diary. With over 92,500 products in the international food database adding items using the smart search is quick and easy. If you cannot find a product with the smart search you can quickly add a custom entry!â Let your device do the hard work The app takes care of the calorie counting and exercise tracking for you, monitoring your calorific and nutritional intake. Stay within the targets and achieve the weight loss you want. Carbohydrates, protein and fat intake can also monitored automatically so you can check you are maintaining a healthy and balanced diet. â¨ â Add exercise to receive additional caloriesâ¨The app includes an extensive list of exercises you can add to the diary to receive calorie credits. Exercise credits are automatically adjusted to take into account your current weight, age and gender so you get a true picture of the energy you have used.â Will the diet work for me? The calculations used by this app work for the vast majority of people. The two groups of users the calculations do not work for are extreme athletes and those users with a very high body mass index ('morbidly obese, category III'). In these cases the app can still track your diet however it will be unable to suggest a daily calorific allowance. If you fall into either group you should consult your doctor to discuss a suitable calorific allowance and nutritional profile and enter these manually, the app can then be used as a calorie counter and diet planner.",

        "comment": "Last year I downloaded the sister app, Perfect Diet Tracker, on my Macbook and loved it, from the fairly complete food list to the exhaustive exercise list, including esoteric things like washing dishes. A couple of weeks ago I downloaded Tracker2Go onto my Droid Bionic, hoping it would be as good as the desktop version. So far, not so much. There are few, if any, foods actually loaded on the phone; instead, with each separate letter that I type, I get a flickering message saying it\\'s connecting to the internet. I\\'m fine with hunting on the web, but please wait until I hit \\\"Search\\\" to begin, instead of searching and changing the list with every new letter (e.g., C-H-E-E-S-E will yield six sets of useless hits, until I type D-A-N-I-S-H).   Also, the finger-scroll is waaay too sensitive, i.e., when i touch the screen to scroll up, it selects the item my finger touches. Then when I want to go back to the list, it takes me back to the beginning and I have to start all over again. Extremely frustrating.   Finally, I hoped to be able to sync with my Mac, but the Mac app tells me hit Sync from my phone, and I can\\'t find a Sync button. A good start but still needs work.",
