It should be a tribute to the nice times we had.The game is very simple, but you have to be a little bit drunk:1.) Choose a guy which you want to win2.) In the game you have to place different guys in the way that the guy will be last, which you have choosen to win. 3.) The guys will be selected randomly, you should not kill all weaker guys unless the guy who can kill you has been defeated.Blonde Guy (Schwede) beats Guy with sun glasses (Faxel)Guy with sun glasses (Faxel) beats Guy with beer (Grabstein)Guy with beer (Grabstein) beats blonde Guy (Schwede)And don't forget to drink some alcohol before you start to play it ;-).
