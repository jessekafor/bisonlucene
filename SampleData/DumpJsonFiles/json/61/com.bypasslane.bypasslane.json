You enter in your section, row, and seat you are at and it shows you all available bypass lane places in the building. Also, at each food place, there is a bright blue mat and is roped off to show you where you should go, so you dont wait in line. They text you when your order is ready and you walk up, to the small line, if there is a line at all, where the big bright blue mat that reads \\\"Bypass Lane\\\".",

What easily would have been a 20 minute loss of game time was only 5.  Very Cool!!!",
