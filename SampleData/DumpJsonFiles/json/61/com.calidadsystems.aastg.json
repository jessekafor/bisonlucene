    "description": "Have you ever been entertaining guests at your house and playing the iPod on random shuffle? All of the sudden you hear: \"Hi my name is Chris and I am a grateful Recovered Alcoholic!\". Well that is exactly what happened in my house. So much for anonymity. So I decided to release AA Speakers To Go. AASTG is a collection of over 400 Speaker Tapes dating from the present all the way back to the 1930s. In addition to the 400+ free speakers, there are special workshops and presentations that can be purchased from within the app. They are collections from some of the greatest members of all time. Recently I was at the AA World Conference in San Antonio. I spent over $200 on Speaker CDs. This is the best deal around. Take speakers with you wherever you go. Listen in the car, on a plane, train or wherever you feel you need a little inspiration.You must have external Storage on an SD Card for the application to work. It is best to download speakers on a WiFi connection, but not required.",
