    "description": "Calltrunk increases the value of your calls by allowing you to save, search and share all of your phone conversations.â¢Record your calls, search their audio and text content, and listen to your calls directly from your Android phoneâ¢Â Calls are saved securely and accessible online through the Calltrunk websiteÂ â¢Sync your recorded conversations with Evernote, Dropbox or BoxCalltrunk is a totally new approach to call recording. Hereâs why: 1.Calltrunk is based onÂ the individual rather than the device. One account enables call recording across all your phonesÂ (including Skype).2.When you sign up you create an account that you can access through your regular web browser or your Android. No matter whether you make recordings on your landline, Skype or Android they all get securely stored in a single online account. 3.This means recordings are not tied to your Android and itâs easy to download recordings, make notes, order transcriptions and sync recordings with other services such as Evernote, Dropbox, SugarCRM or Box. 4.Calltrunk is FREE TO TRY. When you sign up to Calltrunk for the first time we offer you 90 minutes of call recording for free. Thatâs 30 minutes on your mobile or landline and 60 minutes of Skype recording. 5.No need to provide a credit card to sign up. Your secure account will be set up with just an email address and a password. 6.AFTER THE FREE TRIAL, if you decide you want to carry on using Calltrunk we offer monthly plans and a pay as you go model. 7.The monthly plans start at $4.99 per month and go all the way up to an unlimited plan at $49.99 which allows you to record unlimited calls on your landline, your mobile and Skype. 8.Pay as you go is 8c per minute. ARGOsearch âSEARCHABALE CONVERSATIONSâ brings call recording to a new level. ARGOsearch is currently included in regular service charges to use on all mobile, landline and Skype recordings made by our customers in the UK, US and Australia.
