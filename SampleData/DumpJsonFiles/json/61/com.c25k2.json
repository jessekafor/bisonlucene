Another gripe is that when trying to sync it to my facebook account I get an \\\"Invalid Token\\\" error which I can\\'t seem how to get fixed.    I have friends using this on their iPhones that love it, we\\'re training together so we decided to both use the same apps. They have zero issues, android app needs updates to work out kinks/bugs.",
