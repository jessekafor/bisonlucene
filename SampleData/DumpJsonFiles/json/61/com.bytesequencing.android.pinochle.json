The partner often chooses trump in suits that it has no aces or tens. Bidding also remains very low so the poor playing often meets the bids, making this game not much of a challenge.",

They quite often hold cards I need when I win the bid and they never seem to \\'get it\\' that they should generally hold a trump for last hand - they\\'re always coming out with something like a 9 of an off suit.  I\\'ve also noticed that there is a glitch with the meld - not all of the cards that count are laid down.  For example;  I just played a round and the opponent laid down a 10 K Q J 9 9 in trump....  no Ace!!  Yet the first card he played out was the Ace.  I\\'ve seen this glitch happen many times, various scenarios.  All the points get counted, just the cards don\\'t display in the meld.",

I can understand lousy passing when you have a poor passing hand, but on numerous occasions my computer partner did not pass me a one card hit for a rope...even when he had double queens. Additionally, when the computer partner took the bid, he would pass me aces when he could have had aces around. Very frustrating.",
