    "description": "KidzKardz is set of mobile flash card decks for young children to learn about the world around them.  Included are animals, fruit, and vegetables.  The inspiration for this application came from a fan of all three; my 13 month old son.Each card features a photo of the object as well as the name of the object voiced to the child.  In addition, animals feature the appropriate sound as well as the voiced name.Simply touch the screen to advance to the next card.  All sounds and voices are repeatable via large buttons in the upper corners designed with smaller child fingers in mind.  Sound volume is easily adjusted with the volume keys of your phone.To switch card decks, simply hit the menu button and select the \"Kardz\" option.  Choose from the available flash card decks to teach your child a new set of items.This application is free and contains no ads.Feel free to email me with questions/issues/suggestions.Tags: educate, education, learn, teach, intelligent, intelligence, animal, fruit, vegetable, baby, toddler, infant, flash, card, flash card, sound, noise, child, kid, young, brain, pre-k, pre-school, preschool, prek, game, flashcard, veggie, young, study, word, development, school, genius, entertain, quiz",

        "comment": "This set of cards and the app set-up is one of the best I\\'ve seen. With a 2 yr old that since she could hold my phone has wanted to do it herself  the simple touch advance is perfect! The cards are also correct and relevant to a toddler (there is no fish and a sounds of bubbles or cards like that). I would recommend this to everyone with a small child.",

        "comment": "This is a great app that is fun & engaging for both young children & English Language Learners. As an elementary teacher, I\\'m always looking for ways to keep kids interested in learning new vocab. While this app is intended for toddlers who are just learning new words, I can see benefits to ELL of any level, too. Using both the voiced word & the sound the animal makes really keeps the Animals deck extra engaging & fun. Showing the written word is highly important to promote reading skills, too!",
