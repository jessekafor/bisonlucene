    "description": "The App is In Exellent Quality !!!!!The 21st Century King James Version is a minor update of the King James Version. However, unlike the New King James Version, it does not alter the language significantly from the 1611 version, retaining Jacobean grammar (including \"thee\" and \"thou\"), but it does attempt to replace some of the vocabulary which no longer would make sense to a modern reader.The 21st Century King James Version is also known for its formatting. Passages considered \"more familiar\" are in bold print, while \"less familiar\" passages are placed in a sans-serif print. Passages from the Revised Common Lectionary are marked with diamonds, and the translations of names are sometimes included with brackets.The 21st Century King James Version has also been released in an edition with the Apocrypha and without the unusual formatting; this is known as the Third Millennium Bible.",
