Take a couple of minutes and let the country know where you stand related to the issues and local candidates.  It only takes a minute to let your voice be counted! When you are done pass the app around to your friends and family and let their voices be heard as well.The Canada Votes 2011 application is a polling app. It asks a series of questions and allows the user to provide their input into national poll results ensuring that accurancy in candidate and party polling is represented at the local level.Crowded Inc. is not affiliated with any national political party.",
