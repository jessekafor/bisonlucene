    "description": "If you forget to mute your phone and it rings or notifications chime during calendar meetings or wakes you up at night, then this Silence Scheduler DND (Do Not Disturb) app is for you. Enable Calendar and Night mode, and forget about having to play with volume control to silence your phone. This app will auto mute and unmute the phone based on your schedule.This Silence Scheduler app is a premium version of my Do Not Disturb Mode app. This app is similar to the Do Not Disturb app on the iPhone and Samsung Blocking Mode app, but has many additional features:* Silence the phone for the night or during meetings or calendar appointments* Disables all audible notifications during quiet time, except alarms* Instant mute timer can be started with just 1 click* Full week night time schedule* Configurable calendar selection* Separate vibrate option for day and night time* Whitelist favorite group of contacts to have their calls always ring, and SMS notifications to chime* Emergency mode for repeated calls from the same number* Auto response via SMS to let the caller know to call back again if it's urgent* Optionally disable Bluetooth handsfree during quiet time.* Cancel mute when you wake up early or the meeting ends earlyPlease note that only calendar meetings marked as Busy silence the phone. If a meeting status in the calendar is set to Available, the phone will not be muted.Limited set of permissions is required for this Silence Scheduler Premium app. Several other Do Not Disturb apps request permissions to open network connections, or to access user's data on SD card, or to location info. It seems unnecessary to me. This app only needs access to contacts, calendar and SMS. With no network access you can rest assured that your personal data is safe.Certain Samsung phones have issues with vibrate mode. If your phone doesn't vibrate when you enable vibration in this Silence app, change vibration settings in your phone's system settings/sounds menu.Note that if you have a task killer app installed on your device, add Silence app to the list of exceptions. Not that you should be running a task killer in the first place. This Silence Scheduler Premium app is designed to be very battery efficient. It doesn't consume more power than absolutely needed.Also, make sure you don't have other apps that manipulate the speaker running at the same time.Keywords: dnd, no disturb, silence scheduler, silent mode, vibrate, vibration, quiet time, night, notification, auto mute, call, sms, quick timer, weekly, calendar schedule, whitelist, exception, emergency, bluetooth",

        "comment": "A few of the better custom ROMs out there have a feature like this built in, but it seems even the most fanciest stock ROMs don\\'t. The ability to silence notification sounds, but not calls or calls from specific people, is absolutely necessary for peace of mind when you are in an important meeting or it\\'s time for some sleep. You can set schedules to automatically turn on during expected times, and can have it read your calendar to automatically mute during meetings. Personally, I have just set it to a 24 h",

        "comment": "Apart from the (customisable) overnight periods of quiet, the beauty of this app is in the way it recognises key words in calendar appointments, and  goes silent during the \\\"meeting\\\".  I used to have problem of forgetting to turn the sound back on after a quiet session, and would miss calls.  Now the phone just knows when I need quiet time, and switches off and back on.  (Hint: on the *instant* setting, if you want a time that is not pre-set, just make it up by tapping the option keys the appropriate number of times.)  I contacted dev to ask about this latter point, and got a full answer within hours. The free version expires after two weeks, and you have to pay to upgrade - either that\\'s cynical or else a nice way of being able to try before you buy.  I\\'ll go for the second, because it\\'s well worth the money..",
