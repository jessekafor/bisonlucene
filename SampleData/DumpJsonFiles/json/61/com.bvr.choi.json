        "comment": "I love TOP to pieces, but I this wallpaper has too many issues. First issue is that it adds adware onto your device that constantly pops up, who knows if its spyware too. Second thing is that all of the pics arent TOP. I saw a pic of seungri and g-dragon. Might as well put daesung and taeyang in there and call it a big bang wall paper. My last issue with this is that the pictures are only decent in portrait.  If you turn into landscape, the pics become stretched, pixelated and distorted. I had to uninstall this, hopefully it gets rid of the adware as well.",

Specifically if you adore T.O.P!\\tTwo of the pics are of G-dragon, not T.O.P  (Haha but I don\\'t mind, since the two of them are my favorites anyhow)",
