    "description": "Carlsberg is on a mission to unbottle you and your friends in social situations. We have created a game that contains over 500 missions which each presents a social challenge. Missions that may scare you senseless but give you an incredible rush when accomplished. Are you ready to unbottle yourself? The only way to find out is to play! You can challenge your friends in various locations like your home, at bars, in stores and even when you're on the move. You choose your location, number of players and name (optional). You can also connect to Facebook and share what's happening in your game with others. Let the game begin. You shake the phone to get your mission and off you go. It's then up to your friends to decide whether youâve accomplished the mission or not. You can continuously share the result on Facebook and Twitter to add excitement. The app will keep track on your progress in the high score list. Want more missions? Just shake the phone!",
