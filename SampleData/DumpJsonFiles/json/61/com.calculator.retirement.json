        "comment": "I don\\'t like the app. They have rightly mentioned, the calculations are not guarenteed and intact they are not accurate. Whatever I enter, itsays I am on track though I know I am not. It does not know my lifestyle, conservative or extravagent and predicts that my savings will be fine which is notcorrect. With my 5 k saving every year, in next 30 years I will be worth around half million with 5% return which can beblown in 5 years with my lifestyle but the tool says,  is am on track.",

        "comment": "The app can\\'t take into account you being a retard. I\\'m on track to have 4.3 million at 65, and I can blow that by 66 and jump off a bridge destitute at 67. It tells you you\\'re on track because it assumes you understand you want to die of old age and it assumes if you can\\'t afford to eat at $1000/plate restaurants now, that you won\\'t in retirement. If you are trying to live like a multi-millionaire in retirement but only saving 5k/yr, then you will work until you\\'re 130 lol",
