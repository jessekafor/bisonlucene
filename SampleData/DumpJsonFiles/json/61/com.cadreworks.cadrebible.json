This is also very unstable and crashes muliple imes per use ... and that\\'s with a tablet that is only 7 months old!  Essentially, they\\'re making the user a beta tester.",

Selection of text is a mess. The two markers float all over the place and never selects what is intended 2. Selecting by verse is easier but it takes 3 click just to highlight it? Please download any competitors product and try them. See how it should be done.  3. Spaces between words! Why aren\\'t they underlined or highlighted??  Sorry but I\\'m uninstalling",
