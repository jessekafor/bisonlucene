        "comment": "This app does exactly what i need it to do. It is a great little tool for sitting down and working out new songs or if you are out and get an idea running through your head. The developer offers great customer support. As this is the only app on the market that does what i need it too I was slightly disappointed when a few crashes happened. After emailing the developer with my concerns he promptly responded and my problems were fixed within 24 hours. Thank you for this great tool.",

        "comment": "I\\'ve been searching for an app that would let me write tabs on the go so I downloaded pretty much all the other so-called \\\"tabs\\\" apps. Every single one was only to access a database to download other band\\'s tabs... nothing useful for those who actually like to CREATE. Pros: +multitrack +playback +only app to create. Cons: -hard to learn (you can have more than 6 measures per songs, good luck finding how) -buggy -no triplets/grouping -no actual note duration selection",
