Go back to the old version until they get this one straightened out.",

Edit, August 24, 2013:  I put the app back on my phone. It has a lot of weaknesses but sadly every other free app was worse (and, from what I could tell from descriptions, screenshots and reviews the paid apps were no better). I\\'m just too addicted to Hearts to do without it entirely.   I am not raising the number of stars, as I am not grading on a curve.",
