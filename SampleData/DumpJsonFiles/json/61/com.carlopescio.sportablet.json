    "description": "Sportablet allows you to connect your Garmin Forerunner or Edge directly to your Android tablet. Provides all the activity details and statistics, charts, maps, and can save to SD card, upload to Garmin Connect, Strava, Training Peaks, SportTracks, Endomondo, RunningAHEAD, export to GPX, and post to Facebook. The app can also import FIT and TCX files from sdcard, flash drives, etc.You can also track all your gear (shoes etc), calculate mileage, cost per mile/km, etc.At this time, the app requires a 10\" tablet. If you have a smaller tablet or a smartphone, please see my Uploader for Garmin instead: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carlopescio.uploaderThese devices are supported:Forerunner 201 and 301Forerunner 305 and 205Forerunner 10, 110 and 210Forerunner 405, 405CX, 410 are in beta: http://goo.gl/XJKPjForerunner 310xt, 610, 910xt are in beta: http://goo.gl/ixrmQForerunner 50, 60, 70 are in alpha: http://goo.gl/DPDKHGarmin Swim is in alpha: http://goo.gl/DPDKHEdge 205 and 305Edge 500, 705 and 800eTrex 30, eTrex Legend HCx, ForeTrex 401Oregon 550tGpsMap csx 60also reported working with Astro 200, Montana and the Garmin Fenix.For more details, see http://www.sportablet.com/answers.html. If you have troubles, take a look at http://www.sportablet.com/help.htmlNote: Edge 500/705/800 and Forerunner 110/210 may take a while to mount (up to 20 sec). Be patient, the app will start when they're recognized as USB devices by the tablet.Sportablet is free to try: you can upload all activities, but explore only the most recent one. Once you know that it works fine with your Garmin device and Android tablet, and if you like what you see, you can activate it with an in-app purchase on Google Play (price is about 5 euros / 6.6 $).Note: in-app purchases are slow, and may take a couple of minutes to be confirmed. Don't panic :-).",

This does what it says on the tin, connects your Garmin!  I have personally saved the file and uploaded to Strava from there, seems more sensible than sending the file directly,  You can also see the Garmin file structure so you can download a TXC route from Ridewithgps etc. and copy it into the New Files folder on your Garmin. No need to muck around with a laptop anymore!",
