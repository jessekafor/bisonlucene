However, as majority of ppl use this for train schedules, it should have a better \\\"favorites\\\" trip list where it saves your routes and allows quick and easy access to schedules showing more than just one train. The app \\\"right track\\\" does a better job with favorites",

A few comments about this app:  - When selecting a favorite, you should be able to select the entire row rather than the text to get it to switch favorites.  - The red notification triangle, pops up but there are no service alerts. - A bit sluggish, but to be honest didn\\'t notice it until I read the comments below. - Widget needed - nice to have",
