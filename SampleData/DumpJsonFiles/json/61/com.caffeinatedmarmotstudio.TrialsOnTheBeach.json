        "comment": "But I can\\'t get past a level halfway through the game darn it!  This game is the greatest, short sweet and to the point.  Works without glitches, has all the right options for a game that you need to keep yourself occupied for 5 or 10 minutes.  No permissions and basically no ads is wonderful too.  Don\\'t change a thing!",
