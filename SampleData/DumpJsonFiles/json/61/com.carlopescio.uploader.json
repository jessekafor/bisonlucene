    "description": "The Uploader for Garmin can read data from your Garmin Forerunner, Edge, eTrex, Oregon, etc, store data in your phone, save to SD card, send activity via email, upload to Garmin Connect, Training Peaks, Endomondo, SportTracks, RunningAHEAD and Strava, export to GPX and share to Facebook. The app can also import FIT and TCX files from sdcard, flash drives, etc.At this time, these devices are supported:Forerunner 201 and 301Forerunner 305 and 205Forerunner 10, 110 and 210Forerunner 405, 405CX, 410 are in beta: http://goo.gl/XJKPjForerunner 310xt, 610, 910xt are in beta: http://goo.gl/ixrmQForerunner 50, 60, 70 are in alpha: http://goo.gl/DPDKHGarmin Swim is in alpha: http://goo.gl/DPDKHEdge 205 and 305Edge 500, 705 and 800eTrex 30, eTrex Legend HCx, ForeTrex 401 Oregon 550tGpsMap csx 60also reported working with Astro 200, Montana and the Garmin Fenix.For more details, see http://www.sportablet.com/answers.html. If you have troubles, take a look at http://www.sportablet.com/help.htmlNote: Edge 500/705/800 and Forerunner 110/210 may take a while to mount (up to 20 sec). Be patient, the app will start when they're recognized as USB devices by the tablet.The app supports Sony Xperia phones with built-in ANT+ chips, if you have one you don't need the Garmin ANT+ dongle.The Uploader is free to try: you can upload all activities, but explore only the most recent one. Once you know that it works fine with your Garmin device and Android phone/tablet, if you like what you see, you can activate it with an in-app purchase on Google Play (price is about 5 euros / 6.6 $).Note: in-app purchases are slow, and may take a couple of minutes to be confirmed. Don't panic :-).This is a simplified version of the Sportablet app, targeting mobile phones and small-screen tablets. If you have a 10\" tablet, check out Sportablet on google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carlopescio.sportablet",

And uploading the session anywhere is a big no no! All I get is a buy or die screen when clicking on the activity. All activities seem to be locked according to small icon picturing a pad lock. So does not quite work according to information on Google play.",

Direct upload to Sporttracks is an excellent addition.",
