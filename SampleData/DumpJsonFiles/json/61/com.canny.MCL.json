        "comment": "Most of Canny\\'s apps don\\'t have these ridiculous permissions.  It can read your browser history and bookmarks.   If it can read your browser history then they could easily identify you personally and all the social networks you visit.  This app force closed many times while it was trying to create \\\"app shortcuts\\\" and open up my browser.  About the app itself:  Its pretty much the same exercises as their other knee apps.  Only new exercises I see are wobble board and pinching your knees  with a ball inbetween.  To be fair, I\\'ll give the other Canny apps I\\'ve used a good rating.",
