        "comment": "I think many if not all complaints stem from not bothering to read the instructions or just giving up too easily.  Once I got the hang of it, it worked great, altho no video capture exceeded 13 seconds in length.  Motion detection works, but at best is not very sensitive -- though this may be due to low light conditions.  Couldn\\'t get it to send images detected via email -- kept getting \\\"email address invalid\\\" although it wasn\\'t.  And BTW, I\\'m using it on my Le Pan 2 tablet.",
