    "description": "NO push notificationsNO spyware NO malwareFREE BONUS - cracked glass and squashed mosquitoes backgroundsThe people born in the sign of Cancer are loyal and dependable, yet at the same time clingy and self-absorbed. Once a Cancer falls in love with you, it grabs you with its claws and doesnât want to ever let you go. On the up side, however, theyâre caring and responsive, so even if you end up being loved by a Cancer, it might be quite the good experience. The Cancer is the most sensitive sign in the Zodiac â some would say, oversensitive, and wouldnât be entirely wrong. Theyâre emotional in both private and business relationships which sometimes can be a downside, and if things donât go well, they tend to be quite self-pitying. However, if things do go well, especially in private relationships, they are ready and willing to give all theyâve got. So if youâre a Cancer and in love, maybe itâs about time to tell your loved one you never want to let them go. So put this Cancer Live Wallpaper on your phone, and let the moving crab sign say it for you.Notes:Application can not be moved to SD card.Application is a live wallpaper, to access it on your phone, read your phone manual.Application is intended for display in portrait mode, it will work in landscape mode but display may not be optimal.Application is ad supported  and may contain ads in the notification tray.Application does not require internet access for primary usage, however internet connection may be required to access some functions (for instance link to More free apps and similar).",

Knowing that my sign is a crab, I\\'ve been obsessing with and researching everywhere about my sign. Even though this is a lite version of the live wallpaper, I still found this the best wallpaper I could find on my Android. A must-have for all Cancers!",
