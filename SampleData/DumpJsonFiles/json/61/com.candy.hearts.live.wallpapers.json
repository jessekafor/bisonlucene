Select one of gorgeous background colors, then choose one of cute heart designs and create your perfect live wallpaper!-\tPerfect girly live wallpaper for Android!-\tInteractive background-Tap anywhere on the screen and new hearts will appear! -\tFull support for landscape mode and home-screen switching!The heart (â¥) has long been used as a symbol to refer to the spiritual, emotional, moral, and in the past, also intellectual core of a human being. As the heart was once widely believed to be the seat of the human soul, the word heart continues to be used poetically to refer to the soul, and stylized depictions of hearts are used as prevalent symbols representing love.In religious texts the heart was historically ascribed much mystical significance, either as metaphor or as an organ genuinely believed to have spiritual or divine attributes.In Egyptian mythology, the heart portion of the soul was weighed in a balance against the feather of Ma'at, symbolizing truth, in the judgment of the dead in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Egyptian sources do not actually reveal whether the heart had to be lighter than the feather for the deceased to pass into paradiseâall depictions show only the weighing of the heart, not the actual results, heavier or lighter.Similarly, in the Bible, this idea emerges in the earliest passages; Genesis 6:5 situates the thoughts of evil men in their hearts, and Exodus 5 through 12 speak repeatedly of the Lord âhardening Pharaoh's heart.â By this it is meant that God made Pharaoh resolve not to let the Israelite slaves leave Egypt, in order to bring judgment against Pharaoh and demonstrate his power: 'Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them' (Exodus 10:1). In the Book of Jeremiah 17:9, it is written that the Lord is the judge who âtriesâ the human heart.The Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary are traditional Roman Catholic devotional images.In European traditional art and folklore, the heart symbol is drawn in a stylized shape. This shape is typically colored red, suggesting both blood and, in many cultures, passion and strong emotion. The hearts have constituted, since the 15th century, one of the red suits in most playing card decks. The shape is particularly associated with romantic love; it is often seen on St. Valentine's Day cards, candy boxes, and similar popular culture artifacts as a symbol of romantic love.Installation instructions:Home -> Menu -> Wallpapers -> Live Wallpapers",
