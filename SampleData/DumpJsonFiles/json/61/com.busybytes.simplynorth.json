    "description": "Before we come up to the app details, let me tell you a little story; 3 months ago, I bought the new iPad with its really awesome retina display. Itâs such a great product but there is still one thing Iâm missing. Where is this lovely little compass which we all know from the iPhone? I can just tell you, I didnât find it despite searching for it in the entire App Store!And on Android? You guess it, I also miss a clean and simple compass on Play Store.  I just wanted a - simple user interface - without many buttons - no big advertisements and banners - built with love, like the original Apple compass - a universal app for both iPad and iPhone - and last but not least: retina graphics for all devices! I believe that there are so many people who have the same thoughts as I do, so I decided to build this App myself. I have worked so many nights to make it pixel perfect and I hope that you love the result! Like or Follow us if you feel the same way: http://www.facebook.com/simplynorthapp http://twitter.com/busybytes http://www.youtube.com/busybytes I almost forgot the rest of the features: - tiny size only 2MB - full Retina support for all devices - chose skin - black/white - tap on the coordinates to copy location+course to clipboard and use it wherever you like - swipe right/ left to convert the location coordinate between the three basic forms DMS, MinDec and DegDec. A must have for geocaching :) - swipe right/ left to display altitude and speed - swipe down or tap on BUSYBYTES to open the ABOUT-BOX Sincerely yours, Eric Help and support: mail@busy-bytes.com âââWhat people are sayingâââ beautifulpixels.com: Simply North is an outstandingly simple app and is incredibly gorgeous to look at.",
