CardBank will work at every retailer with a hand scanner as evidenced by our reviewers below.â Those reviews who say CardBank doesn't work, state in their own words that they only tried it ONCE and when it didn't work on the first scan, immediately wrote off the entire app as a scam. This simply isn't true and we have asked repeatedly for people to contact us through Twitter so we can help with any problems which 9 out of 10 times is user error.

This will be a keeper.â âReview from iPhoneAppListâ âThe iTunes reviews for this app were all over the place. Some loved it, some hated it. Iâm wondering how many of the people who couldnât get it to work werenât following the scanning tips.â -iPhoneMomâTipsââ Set your device to full brightnessâ Rotate your device to landscape viewâ Use handheld scanners if possibleâ Scan at a slight angle â Hold the scanner 6â away from your iPhoneâStill have questions?ââ Visit our website at http://barcode2mobile.comâ Reply to us on Twitter, our user name is âCardBankâCardBank is created and supported by one of the leading barcode solution providers in the nation.
