        "comment": "The call received screen does what it says: shows Facebook info, status update, and sms scroll. Would be more beneficial if it pulled info from contacts as well and if status section scrolled; as is, it doesn\\'t post birthday unless it\\'s visible in Facebook and only sms scrolls.  It bothered me more that it separated all of a person\\'s numbers so I had to link each number individually...and then the contact list has no indication of which number is which.  I just have a list with my husband\\'s name 4 times.",
