No. Developers made a major faux pas by breaking the accustomed functionality of the Android back button. Fix that, and the fifth star is yours.",

        "comment": "I really should give it a 4 Star because it would take a few $ Million Dollars for me to get the full potential out of this App. And all I have is a $100 and some change.  This helps. I really only use the Mouser Catalog on PAPER! But to cross reference and double check to see if something better might be around, this tool helps.  If I were dealing with more money I would be much more serious about this tool. Very handy, and could be a real money saver if you have money to save.",
