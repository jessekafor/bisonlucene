        "comment": "I can\\'t tell you how often I find myself digging through ESPN looking for this information and spending hours cross-referencing schedules! Based on the screenshots it should be really cool once the season kicks off and we start seeing some game results (just dates right now). With that said, theres a couple of things I\\'d like to see. I\\'d like to be able to see a team\\'s full schedule and it would be awesome if we could see more details about individual games and perhaps link off to ESPN for box scores.",
