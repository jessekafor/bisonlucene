There are other text editors out there just as good (or better) whose developers are not just after your money.",

Do I risk it? I\\'m nervous. Come on, devs, this is ridiculous. Return key does nothing. Impossible to find the end of my doc and continue writing. I need basic formatting in the documents I export, I haven\\'t got time to faff about fixing paragraphs afterwards. Grr.",
