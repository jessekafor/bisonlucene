    "description": "The LeadTime Calculator brings an old school production tool to your new school digital device. Based on traditional paper wheel leadtime estimators this app allows you to calculate the expected completion date of a project/production run/etc by spinning the wheel until the start date pointer indicates your start date. Then look up how many weeks are allocated for the project and that will identify your completion date.This app is brought to you at no charge and is supported by ads. Hopefully in a non-intrusive way. If you like it click those adds and AdMob will show me the love in the form of cash.
