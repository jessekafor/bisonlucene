        "comment": "Ok this app is pretty cool but the only thing annoying about it is that you can hear the loop to the static sound of the radio. This app should have more radio options as well like more static from silent hill 2 and 3 and so on, also a volume adjuster on the radio. The ability to hear this app even though you press the power button would awesome as well.  One last thing, can anyone make a Soundboard of the whole series? Please Update Soon!!!",
