    "description": "Ocean Aquarium 3D live wallpaper is a peaceful underwater scene with dozens of types of fish, a starfish, and a sea turtle. Occasionally a shark or killer whale will turn up.Touch the fish to interact with them.The background is a deep blue with dark contrasts to prevent it from competing with your icons. The animations are subtle and the scene as a whole isn't so busy that it's distracting. Set the number of active fish from the settings screen.Supports all screen sizes!",
