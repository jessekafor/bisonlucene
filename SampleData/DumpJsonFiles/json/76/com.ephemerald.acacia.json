    "description": "A Camera Assistant's tool for film-makers working in both film and DV, and still photographers.FEATURES:Acacia provides a graphical Depth Of Field (DOF) calculator, equipment management, shot logging and a basic slate or clapper board.  It now also contains a Director's Viewfinder (useful to the camera operator and location scout).  The DVF includes a compass and level overlay.PERMISSIONS:Acacia now requires permission to use your device's camera.  The camera is used for the Director's Viewfinder.  It currently does not actually take pictures, but will in a future release.FREE & PAID VERSIONS:This is the voluntary paid version, also known as the \"Beer Fund Edition\".Acacia is intended to be primarily of use to indie film crew - director, cinematographer, DOP, camera operator, and camera assistants (1st AC, 2nd AC).  Its interactive DOF calculator may also be of interest to still photographers.It is free to use, asks for minimal special permissions, and will never display annoying ads.  Acacia is continually evolving and is developed as I have time.Please leave feedback with comments or suggestions.  Bug reports are well-appreciated.",
