    "description": "Letter Land Mahjong HD Free is a completely new and unique way to experience this classic tile matching game. Match the letters of the alphabet, numbers and shapes on tiles. All of the letters are designed with a happy pastel colored theme. It includes 56 different puzzle layouts each with random tile orders so you can play again and again with it never being the same. Find matching pairs of images at the left and right ends of the lines in the various puzzles to remove the tiles from the board. As an extra twist you match any diamond to any diamond and match any heart to any heart. Letter and number pronunciation occurs when a match is made. We think this is a great game for people learning English as a second language as well as just being fun for everyone! Features: â Beautiful graphics and happy letter theme that the whole family can enjoy! â 56 different puzzle layouts with a different puzzle each time. â Letter and number pronunciation in English occurs when a match is made. â Great background music and fun sounds.",
