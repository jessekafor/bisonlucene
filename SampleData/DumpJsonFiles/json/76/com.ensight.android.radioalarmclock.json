First, when you set the alarm, there is no notification in the status bar to let you know it\\'s set (unlike the default android clock, or just about every other alarm program). A simple little ongoing notification that the program has, in fact, got the alarm ready would be a great reassurance.  Second, no matter what I try, the snooze is stuck on 10 minutes. Doesn\\'t seem to matter what I set it for in the alarm setup screen, it\\'s always a 10 minute snooze.  Third, you can set the alarm to a \\\"radio station\\\" to wake up to streaming audio. But, it would be nice if the alarm had a \\\"fail-safe\\\" notification sound option in case you are in an area of bad service, or turn off data during the night to save battery.",
