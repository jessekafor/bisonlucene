    "description": "This interactive field guide to the wildlife and plants of 100 National Parks includes all the birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians you'll encounter while visiting a park as well as helps you identify native trees and wildflowers. NOTE: This app requires an active internet connection.Created for the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), the guide is also full of useful information about each park such as major sites within it, directions, hours and fees, links, and phone numbers to make reservations or get more information.The NPCA National Parks Field Guides will help you do all sorts of things--- find out what species of bird you just saw on the beach in Cape Cod, learn what grizzly bears eat for dinner in Denali, know when porcupine mating season begins in the Shenandoah or identify the trees you find in Yosemite.It's comprehensive-- all native birds and animals are included, along with photos, in-depth descriptions, audio, field marks and more. Users can also search for Endangered Species or Poisonous/Dangerous species native to any of the 100 national parks featured.The 100 parks included are a representative sampling of the hundreds of parks in the national park system that support critical wildlife habitat â from seashores and recreational areas to riverways and historical sites.Intended for novices and experts alike, the guideâs design and content selection maximize its accessibility and ease-of-use so that users can easily find within the guide the wildlife they are most likely to encounter. No other field guide matches the content and capabilities of this mobile field guide.The field guide was developed for the National Parks Conservation Association by eNature.com. At the heart of this mobile app is eNatureâs comprehensive, geographically segmentable database of U.S. wildlife, both animals and plants. eNature.comâs core content of wildlife information includes almost 6,000 individual species and originated with the same data set used to create the printed Audubon Field Guides. All the data has been carefully reviewed and vetted by leading biologists, zoologists and other natural history specialists. eNature.com has consistently been one of the Internet's most-visited sites for nature and wildlife information and has won numerous awards and accolades.",

The problem is that the lists only download a small section and when you try to get to the bottom to tell it to continue uploading, it scrolls back up to the top of the list. After 20 minutes of fighting I am giving up and uninstalling. Too bad it looks like it might be a nice app.",

        "comment": "What program designed for the remoteness of National Parks requires Internet connection? Once you set foot in the park, away from reception/wifi the program is useless. when you are back at civilisation the program is not user friendly to the point of not being useful. The full list can\\'t be used because as it refreshes it keeps taking you back to the top. Anything after c is unreachable. The alternative is filtering, which requires you to know enough about the animal. If I knew I wouldn\\'t need the app!",
