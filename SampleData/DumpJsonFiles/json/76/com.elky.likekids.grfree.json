        "comment": "This app has potential, although it could become a bit repetitive. It uses the same multiple choice approach to complex grammar as is uses for simple vocabulary. Also, accents/stress marks are omitted. Another slightly annoying feature is that \\302\\240\\317\\203 is used at the end of words rather than \\317\\202. Otherwise, a very enjoyable app.",
