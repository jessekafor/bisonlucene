    "description": "Available at $0.99 for a limited time only! \"Emilly In Darkness\" is an old school action-adventure game in which on one hand the character shoots, sets traps and learns new skills, but on the other hand the character must navigate a gloomy, complex world with a twisted and unpredictable plot, highlighted by cut-in animations and conversations with NPC's. \"Emilly in Darkness\" tells the story of Emilly who, for reasons unknown, wakes up alone in a dark forest, and after a few moments is fatally gunned down by an unseen assassin. However, she does not die, at least not in the traditional sense of death. Instead, Emilly finds herself suspended in a grim and odd place, not so different from hell. She is lost, alone, surrounded by demons, and oddly enough, other forlorn people, people whose intentions are not always clear. This is just the beginning... *IMPORTANT* Emilly In Darkness requires devices with minimum 512 MB RAM to run properly.Main features: â¢ Great story â¢ Dark atmospheric world â¢ Challenging gameplay â¢ Unique hand-drawn artwork â¢ Simple rpg elements (NPCs, skills development)zelda like gameplay, horror theme...",

        "comment": "Neat creepy atmosphere, pretty fun overall and a good story but movement / aim control does sometimes get stuck.  Pausing can often fixe it but not always (going to main menu always fixes it but you got to redo a bit of some levels).  Still it saves lots and really the sticking didn\\'t affect my overall experience much.  It happens on this tablet but it doesn\\'t happen on my phone tho so you may be fine on your device.  Update - The game is a bit short and has a couple of bugs, and I\\'m not a person that gives out 5 Stars much, but this game was such a great experience.  It\\'s not too long but it doesn\\'t cost much either and is a full game with no IAP tricks so the entertainment value for the money makes it so worth it.  It\\'s hard for me to explain just how much I enjoyed it in this short space but I\\'m so very happy I got to play through this and can\\'t wait to see what these guys do next!",
