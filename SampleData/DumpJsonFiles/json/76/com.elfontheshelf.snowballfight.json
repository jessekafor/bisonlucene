    "description": "An Official Elf on the ShelfÂ® AppThe elves have been working so hard! Itâs time for a fun game of Snowball Fight! Throw snowballs at your elf friends to score as many points as you can without getting hit. Keep playing and advancing levels, but watch out: the higher you go, the faster the snowballs fly.The Elf on the Shelf TraditionHave you ever wondered how Santa knows who is naughty and who is nice? The Elf on the ShelfÂ® â A Christmas Tradition is the very special tool that helps Santa know who to put on the Naughty and Nice list. This interactive holiday hide-and-seek tradition is perfect for children and families of all ages.The tradition begins when Santa sends his scout elves out to Elf Adoption Centers. Waiting for their families to bring them home, these patient elves hibernate until their family reads The Elf on the ShelfÂ®, gives their elf a very special name, and registers their adoption online. Once named, each scout elf will receive its Christmas magic and become a part of the familyâs Christmas each and every year.Excellent listeners and even better observers, these scout elves are the eyes and ears of Santa Claus. Although they cannot be touched, or else they may lose their magic, the elf will always listen and relay messages back to Santa. Taking in all the day-to-day activities around the house, no good deed goes unnoticed; these scout elves take their job seriously.Each night, after the family goes to bed, the scout elf uses his magical Christmas powers to fly back to the North Pole. Once there, the elf will make his or her daily report to Santa and visit with elf friends where they will tell stories about their beloved families, play with the reindeer, and of course, sneak some of Mrs. Clausâ cookies!Before the family awakes each morning, their special scout elf will fly back to their home from the North Pole. However, since these elves like to play games, donât expect to find them in the same spot! While some like to hide in the freezer (probably because it reminds them of the North Pole) and others prefer to sit on the fireplace mantle or hang from the chandelier, these elves love to play hide-and-seek with their families.On Christmas Eve, the scout elf will listen for Santaâs bell and then fly back to the North Pole until the next season, wishing every girl and each boy a Christmas of peace and a year full of joy. Join the tradition and get your own Elf on the ShelfÂ® now!",

Sometimes when I throw a snowball at an elf, it hits Santa when Santa is on the opposite side.  Would be 5 stars if there weren\\'t issues.",
