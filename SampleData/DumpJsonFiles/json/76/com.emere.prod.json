    "description": "emere is the new way to pay for small traditional cash purchases directly with your phone.  Look for participating retailers and vending machines with the \"emere enabled\" logo.  It is simple and secure to add funds to your wallet and use those funds to pay for purchases; just like using cash but safer.  No secure information is stored or used in the application so it's super safe to use.  Get specials and promotions on your phone as you frequent retailers or vending machines.",
