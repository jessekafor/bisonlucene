If the audio for any units happens to not play after pressing the button just return to the main menu and just access the said button again and it will play now, just a minor glitch in the system, and a very easy solution is to just re access that page again just by going back and again, i no longer make sense so just have fun with it! :DStarCraft Byte \"by a fan for the fans\"****************************",
