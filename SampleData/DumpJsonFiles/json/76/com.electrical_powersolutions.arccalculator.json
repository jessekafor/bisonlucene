    "description": "This free app allows for quick calculation of arc flash values and supplies the hazard risk category level associated with that value. This is not intended to replace the process of performing an approved NFPA 70E or IEEE 1584 arc flash study. This application can simply be used as a theoretical tool to better help understand what factors affect the severity of an arcing event. To receive a free arc flash study proposal and handbook, please contact service@electrical-powersolutions.com or call 651-433-4550.",
