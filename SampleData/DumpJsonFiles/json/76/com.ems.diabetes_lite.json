    "description": "This âYoga for Diabetes Mellitus\" Application brings with it the latest possible features that can be provided in the rapidly advancing field of mobile technology. This is a rich video app. Those affected by âDiabetes Mellitusâ due to unhealthy life style or due to hereditary cause, can reduce their medication by perfecting the Yoga practice through this application. Balancing sugar levels will become a lot simpler with these routines. This 70 Minutes Visual Guide mobile app is the result of more than two decades of research based on western methodologies, modeled by experts in Yoga practices at the one and only SVYASA Deemed University. The âPlay allâ feature in âPracticeâ will allow you to complete the entire practice from start to finish without switching on or off, allowing you to gain mastery over mind. Carousel view in âStepsâ feature will allow you to select one Asana and one step in that Asana at a time to study and perfect. The text associated with each step details the most recent findings about the Asana and perfect method of doing the step. There is an additional âFavoritesâ feature, by which one can select the Asanas of choice to study / practice / perfect by regular review. In most case theory associated with the Asana is also given. The best of the EAST flows through the feature âTheoryâ. This is a Video / Picture presentation of the root cause responsible for a disease including that of Diabetes. Dr. H.R. Nagendra, Prof. Raghuram NV and Dr. R. Nagarathna of Swami Vivekanda Yoga Anusandhana Sansthana University (SVYASA) explain the concepts lucidly.",

        "comment": "Diabetes already costs me $30,000 a year, why should I pay for this? If you really want to help people it should be without cost to the person needing help. Hope one day you don\\'t need help...because someone will charge you too, and if you can\\'t afford it...you end up like the people uninstalling this app. Like me. I need my money for medicine to help my diabetes.",
