The best writing app that allows organising whole chapters, articles, research  etc into separate themeable  compartments.

Marvelous and very stable. Reminds me of \\\"Write\\\" or \\\"WrireRoom\\\"  This software is stable, does not crash and looks great. The interface takes a couple of days to figure out but that\\'s to be expected. Uploading to DropBox is a plus. Fonts and page colors are superior to most such programs. With office pro and Documents to go, you have a generic white page and that\\'s it. xWriter allows your personality to come through. The folder setup is simple and easy to operate.  Overall xWriter is the better choice for Android, strong, safe, effective and easy to operate.",
