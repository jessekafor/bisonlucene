    "description": "Find a nearby recycling point and help save the planet!We all know that recycling is important and that we should be looking to recycle and re-use as many of the earthâs precious natural resources as possible, but sometimes finding WHERE you can recycle a particular item can be quite an effort. The Find Recycling app allows you to locate various recycling points around your current location and will then guide you there with a map. You can also search for recycling points elsewhere via a simple place name or postcode search to help friends or relatives properly dispose of their old waste from glass bottles to batteries to TVâs.Built-in coverage varies by country & city. Some areas have near complete coverage while other areas are less well covered - if at all in some cases - so please check coverage for your area below prior to purchase:Austria ââââBelgium ââDenmark ââFinland âââFrance ââGermany âââââIreland ââItaly âLuxembourg âââThe Netherlands ââNorway ââSweden ââSwitzerland âââUK âââThere are recycling points all over the world in this app already but we know that we have not mapped them all yet and so weâd like your help. If we don't have your local recycling center then please add it and help other users in your area to do their bit for the planet too; if you know extra details about a recycling point that we already have, then you can similarly update its details. To add a new location, simply stand in front of it with your Android phone and tick the types of recycling offered. If you know it, you can add the name of the center and the opening hours in too, but it's not required. We'll then check your submission and feed the update back into our database to help all future users.",
