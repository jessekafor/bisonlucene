    "description": "On January 8, 1935 The King Of Rock 'N' Roll was born. Musician, actor, pop symbol and cultural icon, the King Of Rock 'N' Roll is still among us today, in our hearts and our tunes, and his legends and enigma lives on forever.This âBrown-Eyed Handsome Manâ believed in âAmerica the Beautifulâ and registered for the U.S. Selective Service System on January 19, 1953. Elvis soon received his Selective Service No. 40-86-35-16. âTrue Love Travels on a Gravel Roadâ and on Monday, March 24, 1958 at 6:35 AM, Elvis, accompanied by his parents and a group of family and friends, started his journey as a army private from the Memphis Draft Board. From there, he and twelve other recruits were bused to Kennedy Veterans Memorial Hospital. There, Elvis was assigned army serial number 53 310 761.He was deputed to Germany. In Germany, he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor Regiment, 3rd Armored Division, Ray Barracks, Friedberg. Also in Germany Elvis met Priscilla Beaulieu, the teenage daughter of an Air Force captain, where she had been invited to a party through a mutual friend. They would eventually marry on 5/1/67 and divorce in 1973.At Fort Dix, New Jersey, this âU.S. Maleâ was honorably discharged from active duty on March 5, 1960.
