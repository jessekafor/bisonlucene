    "description": "Define a phone number and/or an email address and whenever you press the big red button, the distress signal will be sent out to these recipients along with your GPS/Network location (a google maps link) and a personalized message.If you or a loved one ever walk through a dark alley, travel abroad or just need to alert someone of your whereabouts - this button will simplify explaining exactly where you are. Help can come faster and within GPS accuracy.Emergency Button will only work if you're in a place with reception to at least send the SMS text message or email.The widget can be added to your homescreen by home->menu button->add->Widgets->Emergency. The widget has 2 buttons and you have to press both within 5 seconds to make the app fire the distress signal. The double button is designed to minimize false positives.None of your information is stored or saved by Andluck. This project is open source (BSD) and hosted on google code: http://code.google.com/p/emergencybutton/ so you can see exactly what's inside if you wish.Disclaimer: this app is presented as is with no guarantee whatsoever. It won't work without reception or connectivity. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed. Please remember that Emergency Button by itself doesn't do emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any type of emergency services.Please feel free to email your thoughts, problems, ideas, etc to contact@andluck.com",

        "comment": "Should definitely bring back the previous version of a two button tap activation,  that version had the right design as the idea is to be able to activate quickly during an emergency - this new design has too many prompts (before sending a message) which defeats the purpose of an emergency button altogether.  The two button design was what made it better than other emergency apps available,  this new design has lost that advantage and has made it just like all the other apps.  The screenshot still shows a two-button activation widget - which is misleading.",

I propose to send email/SMS twice: first time with approximate coordinates (based on cell stations) - this should take not more than 2 seconds, second time with real GPS coordinates (takes up to 30 seconds on my device). Or at least make this behavior tunable.     10x",
