    "description": "View pictures of modern technological endeavors, achievements, and processes. These pictures were chosen based on merits of aesthetics, and technological complexity. This collection explores the pinnacles of today's engineering and the products of scientific advancement. As you scroll through these pictures, just think how many people, and how much of their time was devoted to create that item. Also, these products were not possible without building on the ideas that came before us. So these items were not made just by people today, but by everyone who contributed to building the ideas on which the item stands. Be inspired!These are actual photographs of real structures, some are CAD drawings, but they are part of the design process and represent practical ideas. None of these are CG; they are REAL man made items, except for a couple screen shots of video games, which is a part of software engineering.Features:-Pictures are updated daily.-High Definition Photos-Randomize-Zoom in and Out-Save Spot, Jump to Spot-Save pictures to Phone-Download and Share Photos-Hide AdsPremium / Paid version additional features:-No Ads-Detailed Descriptions, Facts, and Specifications-Randomize-Favorites (Coming Soon)I highly recommend the premium version if you want to understand the picture rather than admire it. Also, there are absolutely no ads in the premium version!This application requires an internet connection!KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE HIGH DEFINITION PHOTOS! BE SURE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION CAN HANDLE THEM, AVG SIZE PER PICTURE = 170KBNormal Version:I use ads from GOOGLE's company admob, they use non-intrusive ads and only operate within the application. GOOGLE's ad company is the most reputable mobile ad company today. They do not partake in questionable business practices, which is the main reason why I use them.ENGINEERING IS:The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast  their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation or safety to life and property.[If you have any problems, concerns, or suggestions email me at: SYMCERNOS@gmail.comtags: engineering, science, pictures, photos, technology, gallery, design, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, chemical, computer, aerospace, automotive, environmental, petroleum, systems",
