    "description": "Puhdys Jigsaw PuzzleThe Puhdys are a veteran German rock band, formed in Oranienburg (Brandenburg), in what was then the German Democratic Republic, in 1969, although they had been performing together, with various lineups, as the Puhdys since 1965. They continue to record and tour. Although they are especially popular in their native eastern Germany, the Puhdys enjoyed significant success outside the GDR, and were one of the first East German bands allowed to tour West Germany. They are one of the most successful German-language rock groups.This game contains the best pictures of your favorite theme.
