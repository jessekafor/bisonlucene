        "comment": "A great app!!  I can finally catalog my book collection!  It\\'s very easy to use as well.  Took only a few minutes to get the hang of things, but after that, easy.  It would be nice if you could make a wish list, or a \\\"to get\\\" list (maybe in red text under the same author, series, etc.).  Also, I think it would be great if we could change the background, maybe a collage of the front covers of the books in our collections.  Overall, a great and essential app for book readers, collectors and such.  Great Job!!!!",
