    "description": "Elite Mail is the app for those that receive a lot of email. No longer will you have to worry about missing an important email from your family or friends because itâs been buried in a lot of other emails. No longer will you need to worry about missing that important email from a company you contacted. No longer will you have to scroll through hundreds of emails to get to email from a certain day.Elite Mail organizes your email into quickly accessible groups. Elite Mail lets you quickly view your email by contacts, address, or date. Email by contact: Elite Mail identifies all email from your contacts, and groups them for your convenience. Elite Mail will also let you know how many of their emails are unread.Email by address: Elite Mail allows you to add email addresses (known as flags) that you wish to access quickly. Elite Mail will set aside any email from an address containing the flag. For example, if the flag is âgroupâ, Elite Mail will grab all emails from groupon.com. This feature is great for daily newsletters. Elite Mail also lets you know how many of these emails are unread.Email by date: Elite Mail sorts all your email by date, placing them in a convenient drop down list for each day.  This feature allows you to quickly go back to the email from a previous day without having to scroll through all of the subsequent daysâ emails. Elite Mail also lets you know how many of these emails are unread.Elite Mail is based on K-9 Mail, an open source mail client for Android originally based on the standard Android Mail client.Elite Mail offers several features over the standard K-9 Mail, including:Emails by ContactFlagged emailsEmails by dateMore coming soonK-9\\'s improved features include:* Push mail using IMAP IDLE* Better performance* Message refiling* Email signatures* Bcc-to-self* Folder subscriptions* All folder synchronization* Return-address configuration* Keyboard shortcuts* Better IMAP support* Saving attachments to SD* Empty Trash* Message sorting* ...and morePlease note that K-9 does not support most free hotmail accounts and, like many mail clients, has some quirks when talking to Microsoft Exchange.Please submit bug reports, contribute new features and ask questions at http://www.facebook.com/EliteMail",
