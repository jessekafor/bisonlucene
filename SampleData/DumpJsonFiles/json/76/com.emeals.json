Minor critique or suggestion is if you have multiple menus if there was a way to merge the shopping list into one shopping list.  Example lunch menu with Paleo dinner...great app and great service",

An absolute MUST is a way to combine multiple plans if you have them. A list that collapses by category would be nice. I would also like to see what meals each item is used for like on the paper lists. And emeals could wow me with offering possible substitutions when I can\\'t find something while I am in the store.",
