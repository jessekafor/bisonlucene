        "comment": "For such a big-ish dload, I expected something with more effort put into it.  Played a few levels to see if it got any better... it does not.  It\\'s just a very basic tower defence game with little to no effort put in. It\\'s slow, the towers are all underwhelming and the game overall is just bland. I did not think it possible to make controls in a tower defence game bad as they are so basic, but this game manages to do just that.  It\\'s an interesting concept I admit. It\\'s just not been put together well at all. Needs massive improvements for a sequel. My advice to the developer... go play some of the better tower defence games and learn what makes them fun.  Give it a try, be disappointed, then uninstall and try one of the many other far better tower defence games out there instead.",

        "comment": "On Galaxy S3:  When the game is loading, it displays distorted backgrounds that look like an old Nintendo game with a bad cartridge.  Game takes a really long time to load and the UI is very sluggish and doesn\\'t register taps right away, making it very frustrating to navigate. When you tap a menu item, it can take up to 5 seconds for the app to respond.  Gameplay is not intuitive and there are no obvious instructions. And police cars shoot laser beams to destroy cars - seems counter-intuitive.  There is nothing about this game that would make me want to play it. The fewer than 15 minutes I spent in the app felt like a big waste of time.",
