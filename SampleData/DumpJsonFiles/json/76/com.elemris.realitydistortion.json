    "description": "IMPORTANT: If you HAVEN'T HEARD the term \"Reality Distortion Field\" before, then this app ISN'T FOR YOU. You won't understand it, so please DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.Reality Distortion Field (RDF) is a technology that enables one to manipulate reality itself. It has been used for decades by highly influential people to excite, convince, and rally; to bring peace and to incite wars; and mostly to sell mediocre gadgets at premium prices.Â For the first time, the secret to the RDF is revealed. The Reality Distortion Field app by Elemris is the first and only to bring this incredible power to your Android phone. Using space-age science, this app allows you to project a small Reality Distortion Field around you to help in your daily life.  Â Influence your peersâ¦ charm anyone... have people marvel at your smartphone even if it has a tiny 3.5 inch screenâ¦ now you can have it all.Â The RDF is maintained by the battery's electric energy. However the battery drain is minimal because the battery is being fed back by Reality Distortion energy from inside the field. In effect battery life may last longer than usual. Â New: SHAKE your device, and the app will convert your body's kinetic energy into RDF energy, for a temporary energy boost.Â Results may vary. Use for entertainment.Works best if used at least 3 times a day.Note: WVGA (480x800) or higher resolution recommended.****Support****If you have any suggestions, questions or issues, please contact us at: http://elemris.com/contact-us/Note that while we appreciate feedback at the Android Market, it is technically not possible to provide support through the market, so do contact us directly.Visit us at our website: http://elemris.com for more info, support and more great apps!",
