    "description": "An Official Elf on the ShelfÂ® AppOnly the best-trained pilot elves can work with Santa to fly Elf on the ShelfÂ® scout elves to their destinations. Play the Flight Training Game to hone your piloting skills! First choose your aircraftâthe cargo plane, the winged jet, or Santaâs sleigh. Then youâll have 30 seconds to collect as many packages as you can from the floating balloon storage pods. Good luck!About Elf on the ShelfCCA and B, the brainchild of The Elf on the ShelfÂ® authors Carol Aebersold and Chanda Bell, along with Chandaâs twin sister, Christa Pitts, is a private, family-owned publishing company based in Marietta, GA. Started from the ground up, this mother-daughters trio has taken the publishing industry by storm â going from rejection letters to a best-selling Christmas tradition that took root locally and spread like wildfire around the globe.Despite their expansion with a national media campaign for Elf on the ShelfÂ® and recent work on the CCA and B and the Big Canoe Entertainment production of An Elfâs Story, a Christmas special written by Aebersold, Bell, and Pitts, this family-focused publishing company remains dedicated to preserving the tradition of Christmas magic and the family ties it has not only inspired for them, but for countless others across the nation.",
