Most of the features to edit or change the app is available for a nominal fee.Permissions:Receive SMS, Read contact data, Read phone state and identity - For any incoming SMS or phone calls, notifications will be forwarded to your Google TV. For the incoming calls, the phone number will be matched in the contacts list and used for the text of the notification.For technical reasons, the All Notifications setting in Able Remote uses Android's Accessibility service and must be enabled in the Android Accessibility settings. For convenience, options are provided on the Able Remote settings screen to go to the Accessibility settings. Just to be clear, Able Remote is intended to be a convenience tool and is not an accessibility tool. The Accessibility service will give a warning that Able Remote may be able to collect personal data. This is because Accessibility doesn't know what or how data passing through it is used by enabled apps. Able Remote only uses Accessibility to pass notification text to your Google TV and not used for any other purpose or stored.Caution:Be aware of the accessibility apps that are enabled when you enable Able Remote! Your phone behavior might be affected by other accessibility apps that were enabled when Accessibility was turned on.External storage is used for sharing button layouts and for storing backups.Vizio Co-Star:The Vizio Co-Star Google TV device does not have a built-in IR blaster. This means that apps like Able Remote cannot control devices attached to your Google TV device unless you follow these instructions:1. Disable power save mode on your Google TV for your physical remote (Settings -> Devices -> Bluetooth -> Vizio XRA700 Remote -> Remote power save -> Off)2. Place the physical remote so that it is pointing at the devices you want to control. Your physical remote will act as a IR blaster for controlling all the devices connected to your Google TV.",
