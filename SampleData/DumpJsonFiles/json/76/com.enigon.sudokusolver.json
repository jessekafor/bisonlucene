    "description": "The AR (Augmented Reality) Sudoku Solver is a tech demo that uses the phone's camera to find sudoku grids, solve them and project the results back into the picture.The program expects the grid to be freestanding, flat and not manually filled.Best results are achieved in good lightning conditions. The solver does not try to solve grids with less than 20 symbols (not restricted to numbers). All symbols must appear at least once.Use the volume keys to toggle debug visualizations.This is not a game, just a tech demo without any practical application that I know of.",

It appears that the app had trouble recognising certain numbers such as 1 and 7.  A better UI could be added to include a \\'freeze screen\\'  button (easier than using two fingers to tap screen).  Other than that this application rocks!",
