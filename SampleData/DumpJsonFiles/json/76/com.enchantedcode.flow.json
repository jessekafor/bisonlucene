    "description": "Flow is an on-screen keyboard that enables exceptionally fast text input on your phone. It combines many different features to improve typing speed:- Enter each word in a single gesture (similar to Swype or SlideIT). Touch the first letter, move your finger smoothly from one key to the next, and lift it when you reach the end of the word. Spaces between words are inserted automatically.- The keyboard layout is optimized by analyzing common patterns in English words. The QWERTY layout used by most keyboards was designed for typing with two hands, and it's a terrible layout for on-screen use. The Flow layout is optimized so common words can be entered with the shortest, smoothest path possible.- Keys are large and evenly spaced for improved accuracy.- The most common punctuation symbols are directly available without needing a modifier key.- Double letters are recognized automatically. You don't need to \"scribble over\" them like with Swype.- When a word is recognized, it flashes briefly on top of the keyboard. You don't need to move your eyes away from the keyboard to verify it.- Long-press any key for a selection of alternate characters.- Supports voice input.- Supports both American and British English.Try Flow today and start improving your typing speed - guaranteed, or your money back! (How many other free keyboards dare to promise THAT?) And please send feedback so we can continue to improve Flow. Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome. Flow is an open source project.",

        "comment": "Everything is fine, except the fact that there are very few symbols available. Fix that and then I can give you 5 stars :) Reply: Yes I do know that, but even then, there are a few symbols missing, such as: \\342\\210\\232 \\317\\200 \\302\\243 \\302\\242 \\342\\202\\254 \\302\\260 ^ \\342\\204\\242 \\302\\256 \\302\\266 \\302\\251. All these symbols are easily available on the stock keyboard though. So if you could fix that, i\\'d be happy :)",

This keyboard is a lot better but not quite perfect due to the unique layout.   The only improvement I would like to see is how you deal with corrections. I tend to type the whole paragraph out and then correct any mistakes. When you move the cursor to incorrect word other keyboards will offer the words that you where likely going for. Flow does not do this",

It may take a little time to get used to it - a couple of days perhaps - but the investment is well worth it. The layout of the keys is intuitive and very fast for the most common word combinations. I hope that more people give it the chance that it deserves. I\\'m very happy with it.",
