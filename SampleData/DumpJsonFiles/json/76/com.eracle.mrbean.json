    "description": "This application gives you access to the cartoon series \"Mr Bean\" and to Mr. Bean's Official Facebook Page. Mr. Bean is an animated television series by Varga Studio based on the British live-action series of the same name. Characters from the original live action series included Mr. Bean, Irma Gobb, Teddy, and the mysterious driver of the Reliant Supervan, with the new addition of Mrs. Wicket, Bean's landlady, and her evil cat Scrapper.The series again featured little actual dialogue, with most being either little sound bites or mumbling, mild slapstick, with occasional sexually suggestive moments. Rowan Atkinson provided the voice for Bean; additionally, all of the animated Bean actions are taken from Atkinson himself. Other characters' voices are provided by Jon Glover, Rupert Degas, Gary Martin, Sally Grace and Lorelei King.Despite the series' actual title being simply Mr. Bean, some broadcasters referred to this series as Mr. Bean: plus a subtitle for disambiguating with the original live-action series. Disney Channel Asia refers this series as \"Mr. Bean - The Animated Series\" [from Wikipedia] DISCLAIMER: The videos in this app are neither uploaded nor hosted by us.
