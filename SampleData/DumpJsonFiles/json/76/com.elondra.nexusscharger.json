    "description": "Warning: This app is only for Nexus S, not for any other model.Many Nexus S have a bug that makes battery charge above 95% impossible, unless you use some nasty tricks (enabling the debug option that keeps the screen on while charging and enabling the Wifi AP mode / Wifi tethering).This app makes that easier for you:When you plug your Nexus S the app launches automatically and keeps the screen on while it's running. It will try to enable the Wifi AP mode, though sometimes that doesn't work, but it will warn you and take you to the settings screen so you can activate it.When the charge reaches 100% the app automatically disables Wifi AP, and closes, so the screen will go off after a while.PLEASE, TAKE NOTE THAT THIS APPLICATION ONLY HAS SENSE WHEN YOUR PHONE IS CHARGING.IT IS NORMAL THAT THE PHONE GETS HOT: CHARGING, PLUS SCREEN ON, PLUS WIFI AP LEAD TO THAT.Please, take into account that when trying to enable the Wifi AP the application will try to use your current configuration, and if it doesn't find one it will create a random WPA-PSK protected one. Be careful and if you create you configuration make sure to use WPA-PSK and a good password, because you are sharing your 3G connection to anyone connecting to your wifi.Hopefully, this bug will be resolved and this app will not be necessary, but in the meantime it makes it more bearable.The application will show a black screen with a dim clock, so the screen is not too bright, making it easier if you want to put the phone to charge in your bedside table (and use it as a clock).Please, take into account that this app is BETA software, so don't give a bad score to it. Mail us with any issue you might have.We have tested the app with a Nexus S phone, and in fact the application will refuse to work on any other model.By installing this application you do it at your own risk, and accept the following:Disclaimer of Warranty.THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
