It is the world's second largest native language, the official in 70 countries, and English-speaking countries are responsible for about 40% of world's total GNP. It can be at least understood almost everywhere among scholars and educated people, as it is the world media language, but also used on TV, pop music and the computer world. All over the planet people know many English words, their pronunciation and meaning.The causes for this universality are very well known and understandable. It first began to spread during the 16th century with British Empire and was strongly reinforced in 20th by USA world domination in economic, political and military aspects and by the huge influence of American movies.The concept of universality is more significant only now, in the era of world mass communication. Before this era Greek, Latin and French were to some extent universal, though mainly in Europe.By a lucky coincidence due to factors above, this is one of the simplest and easiest natural languages in the world.Of course the concept of easiness is relative, and it depends on your mother tongue. However the concept of simplicity is undeniable: it is an easy language to learn, understand and speak. First of all, it uses Latin alphabet, the most universal, simple and short one (only the Greek alphabet is shorter and simpler). In addition, the Latin Alphabet presents its most \"clean\" form as a true alphabet with only 26 basic letters and no diacritics;Verb conjugation is very simple and easy. Even for irregular verbs, there is almost no variation in person (except 3rd singular in present tense).Regular verbs have only four forms. First two are Infinitive + Present, Past Tense + Past Participle. Another two are  3rd person singular Present Indicative and Present Participle.There are almost no Inflections. No number or gender inflection for adjectives, articles, and adverbs. For adjectives there is only comparative and superlative, almost only number for nouns. In pronouns there are gender and number inflections and only three declension cases (Acc/Dat, Nom, Gen).This quiz covers all the English fields. Want to try to answer a question? Here you are one!
