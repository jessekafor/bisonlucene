    "description": "Need some help when it comes to playing your favorite word game? Auto Words With Friends Cheat was designed to help you get the best possible words while playing Words With Friends. By using the actual dictionary from the game, this app ensures that all results returned will be valid words. In fact, we guarantee that this app will get you the highest score possible for your rack every single time.  Impress all your friends with the great words you can come up with!Using this app couldn't be easier!Step 1: Take a screenshot of an in-progress game of Words With FriendsStep 2: Use this app to automatically read your screenshot to instantly import all letters and words from the board and rack of your WWF gameStep 3: Play the best word and dominate your opponents! They'll never know you're cheating, since the app also provides definitions for the words!In addition to having the best dictionary of any Words With Friends helper app in the Play Store, this app uses the most intuitive and efficient way to import your games.  Simply take a screenshot of your game (instructions on how to do this for each phone can be found within the app), then Auto Words Cheat will analyze your board and output the best possible words nearly instantaneously!  This app will work with ANY phone or tablet, and doesn't require any extra work on your end to set up.  What other Words With Friends or Scrabble cheat app can say that?  (Hint: none, because our board/grid solver with screenshot importing makes this the best WWF cheat app around!)  This app works so fast that you can even discreetly use it while you're hanging with your friends.Clicking on the define button for any of the words generated by Auto Words With Friends Cheats will bring up their definition, so you never have to worry about being exposed as a cheater. Everyone knows it isn't cheating if you know the definition!The intuitive \"In-game mode\" feature that allows you to go back and forth between playing the game and getting help. Whenever this button is clicked, Words With Friends is launched and a notification that lets you quickly come back to get help with your next rack goes into the status bar.Please note that this app includes a completely optional in-app upgrade.  If you wish to see all of the top words, a one-time $0.99 purchase will unlock them all forever.  If you don't wish to upgrade, you can still easily win 99.9% of your games. As with all epEK.ware apps, comments and feedback on Auto Words With Friends Cheat are always appreciated. A link to my email address can be found within the app.Note: This Words With Friends cheat app is in no way associated with Zynga, Inc, makers of the popular crossword-style word game Words With Friends.  Additionally, it is only compatible with Words With Friends for now (support for EA's Scrabble and WordFeud is planned for a future update).",
