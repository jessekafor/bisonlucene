        "comment": "For a game I bought I expected a lot more levels than only 4 chapters. Instead they make the 4th chapter ridiculously hard to play without constantly dying. Other than that though it\\'s a great little game with a fresh take on block breaker and chalk ball style games. Just way too short in my opinion for a paid game. I have it installed months now and no new levels have been added except for a boring endless mode. PLEASE UPDATE AND ADD SOME NEW LEVELS TO PLAY.",
