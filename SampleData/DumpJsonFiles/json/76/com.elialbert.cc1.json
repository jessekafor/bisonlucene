Crowd Control is very simple: Anonymous, Localized Text-based Chat rooms. Talk to the people close to you, without knowing who or where they are. That's it.Give it a try! Currently you can control the distance of speech, but many more features are on the way.Use-cases: public parks, schools, streets, roads, talks, lectures, clubs, concerts - anywhere strangers gather in a common purpose.And check it out online - the early working version is up at crowdCTL.com! works on iphone too..",
