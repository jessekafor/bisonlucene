I use Google Maps for work and have all of my customers already saved.  It would be nice NOT to have to add them into yet another map.  It would be nice if I could search my customers and have a reminder added to tell Mrs Smith something next time I am at her property.  Or remind me to complete such and such a task next time I am in Mr. Jones\\' neighborhood.",

It fails at the important function of being able to reliably set location -- tried multiple times but wouldn\\'t save location, then when checking it wouldn\\'t save the task -- so, overall, it\\'s not fit for purpose, and the programming is clearly beyond the dev as he hasn\\'t bothered to issue updates / bug fixes since very early this year -- current rating is overly generous for an app that fails its very first purpose -- thank God, it\\'s free, but it should be taken off the market till the dev can make it work -- turns out the website couldn\\'t even find me on the map, so that might explain things, but it still fails at its \\\"purpose\\\"",
