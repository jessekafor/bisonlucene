    "description": "Can you name the currencies used in 100 different countries? You obviously know about the main ones: dollar, euro, pound, yen.But what about the currency used in Ethiopia, Bosnia, Papua New Guinea or Venezuela?Aha, we are sure you will not know those. So gotcha!As always, we do not want to bore you with zillions of questions. Instead, each quiz is just 100 questions on a particular topic, packaged in a neat app. We like to call it the âDisposable Quizâ package.And you know what? Because, several research studies show that apps are used mostly once, and then left to clutter the screen, we are making it easy for you to keep your screen nice! Yea right!  So once you have attempted the 100 questions, and you are happy (or sad â we donât really care) of your scores, go ahead and press the âUninstallâ button at the end. And of course go immediately and download the next 100Q quiz.If you like our quizzes and want to send us your own quiz title plus questions, then visit www.100q-quiz.com or send us an email on support@100q-quiz.com ThanksYours sincerelyChief Quizmaster",
