    "description": "Electro house is a hard form of house music. Electro house's origin is obscure, with varying influence attributed to 1980s-electro, electroclash, pop, synthpop,and tech house. Electro house found mainstream popularity around 2005, and the term has been used to describe the music of many Top 100 DJs, such as deadmau5, Porter Robinson and Wolfgang Gartne.Electro house sometimes contains elements of tech house such as prominent basslines, short and high-pitched riffs, and minimal to medium amounts of percussion. Unlike tech house, however, it can include abrasive, electro-influenced synths and vocal or instrumental samples. The tempo is usually around 128 to 130 BPM. Recent compositions tend to feature a \"dirty\" bass sound created from saw waves with compression and distortion.Subgenres:Complextro,Dutch house,Fidget house,Moombahton.Thanks,Jaack Dawson.",
