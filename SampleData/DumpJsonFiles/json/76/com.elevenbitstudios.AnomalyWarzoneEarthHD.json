        "comment": "This game is probably one of the few RTS/Tower Defence games to ever come to Android.  It\\'s simple, intuitive and fun to play. Graphics are also very good.  It might be an expensive game but it\\'s worth it if you like RTS and tower defense games.   I like that its a reverse tower defense game, this means that instead of adding towers, you have to make your way past them. The game doesn\\'t just throw you in at the deep end though which is good (most other games on Android just assume you know how to play them).  Controls are fairly good, and this game actually benefits from having touch screen controls.",
