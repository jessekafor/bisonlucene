        "comment": "My church is currently following the E100 plan, and this app seems to be really helping me stay on track.  E100 has chosen a great selection of Scripture passages. I have it on my phone and tablet, and I always have at least one of those with me wherever I go.  I\\'m not sure what version of the Bible this app uses, but I\\'m not crazy about it - that would be my only complaint.  But, of course, I have the free Bible app so I can read a different version if I want to.  I haven\\'t had any problems with the app itself.  My phone is running Gingerbread and my tablet ICS.  It\\'s the most expensive app that I\\'ve purchased, but I definitely think that it is worth it!",
