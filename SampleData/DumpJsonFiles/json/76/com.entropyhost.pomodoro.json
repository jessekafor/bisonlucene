    "description": "Having trouble focusing? Pomodoro Tracker will massively improve your productivity by dividing your work into manageable blocks of time (called \"pomodoros\"), with frequent short breaks. But this is much more than the average timeboxing app:* Set goals for each weekday, and you'll have a progress bar for how close you are to reaching your goals for the day and the week. This is an incredible motivator!* Every pomodoro you complete is stored in a database, which you can use to track your progress.* Chart your progress over time! (Pro Version, an in-app purchase)* Create categories of activities, such as \"Programming\", \"Gardening\" and \"Studying\", then track and chart them separately. (Pro Version)* Pause a pomodoro in the middle - never drive yourself crazy waiting that last ten minutes to take an emergency bathroom break!* Adjust the time of the current pomodoro by tapping the timer text - perfect for adding time if you get sidetracked, or subtracting time if you did work off the clock.* While working, the icon in the action bar shows the number of minutes left, so you can see without unlocking your phone or leaving another app.* After completing a pomodoro, you'll see a timer - in case you spaced out and didn't notice the alert sound, you'll know how much longer you were working.* Configurable work and break lengths, as well as a long break interval.These are just a few of the features that make Pomodoro Tracker stand out from the crowd. Give it a try - you'll be amazed how much more productive you'll be, and how refreshed you'll be from the frequent short breaks!--------------------------------------------------------------Pro Version:This is a $6.99 in-app purchase, available from the \"Upgrade to Pro\" menu item. The pro version unlocks the pomodoro history graphs, activity tracking, removes the ads, and will most likely offer more features in the future.Coming soon: task tracking!--------------------------------------------------------------Permissions:BILLING - Enables the pro version upgrade.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, INTERNET - Used for ads in the free version.DISABLE_KEYGUARD, WAKE_LOCK - If enabled, allows your phone to wake up when pomodoro is finished.VIBRATE - Self-explanatory.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - We try to write the history database to the SD card to make it easier for you to access and back it up.",

        "comment": "I purchased the pro version of this app because goal and activity features are worth the money. That\\'s great to be able to put daily goals of number pomodoros, and to see how much you achieve. It\\'s also wonderful to classify the pomodoros based on the activity type. However I cannot use the app because of some simple limitations: 1) It makes a ticking noise in first 5-10 seconds of each pomodoro and there\\'s no way to deactivate it, it ticks even at the silent mode! I share an office with colloquies and it\\'s embarrassing when I forget to turn down the volume. I cannot use it during meetings for the same reason. 2) Many times I forget to turn the app on, or study/write when I don\\'t have my phone with me. I\\'d like to record those times later but there is no way to enter number of pomodoros later. It would be great if developers put an option to enter pomodoros for a particular day later so the statistics and goal settings would be meaningful. If these two items are fixed, I\\'ll happily update my rating and my comments.",
