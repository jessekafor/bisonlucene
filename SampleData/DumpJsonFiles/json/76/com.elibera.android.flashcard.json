I used it also for memorising mathematical formulas. - a little bug is that when power learning is finished, then it displays that one should wait for 30 minutes for a rest, even after 5 hours. A workaround is to delete trainer and then import it again.",

Would be awesome if there was some way to use google spreadsheet to link to the pictures somehow. Other then that I couldnt be happier, makes learning new content easy and I can always practice when I have a few minutes spare. cheers!",
