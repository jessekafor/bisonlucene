Permission on your phone calls, your GPS location, etc. After I installed this app my volume took a mind of its own and started going up and down like a ghost was playing with it. I ran a virus scan and sure yes, there was a very active link from this app. This app was profoundly adjusting an attack on my device. After I uninstall it all my problem went away. A lucid dream alright, a lucid nightmare it was!    And if the developer does not no of this then they need to fix this asap.",
