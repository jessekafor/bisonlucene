    "description": "If you're tired of having to do \"team captains\" every time you want to change up teams, but don't want entirely random teams either, give this app a try.This team picker is designed for Ultimate Frisbee games.  Team player distribution is based on 7 different player skills and allows selecting which players are there before picking teams.Skills used: height, speed, catching, throwing, defense, competitiveness, experience, endurance.The algorithms used are quick and efficient, and produced fairly balanced teams based on the skill ratings.  It takes only a few seconds to add a player to the database, and only a few seconds more to un-select players not present.Some advanced options are available in the Preferences, as well as turning on a more detailed explanation of the team balances after the algorithm is done selecting players.* Supports 8 different player skills with ratings of 1 to 5.* Add, edit, and delete players.* Pick any number teams.* Select players available for current game.* Force certain players to be paired with or separated (split) from others.* Mark players as inactive to make selecting available players quicker.* Backup, restore, send (e-mail, Dropbox, etc.), and receive/load player database.* Import and export CSV versions of the database.* Easy and lightweight interface.* Can try to make teams' gender distribution equal.* Optional skill weighting.",

        "comment": "Works well but I play with a few different pickup groups, and it would be nice to be able to group/tag players so when I play with one group I don\\'t have to sort through all the players in my other groups. Would also like to see overall player ratings, to make sure I\\'ve got the weights and individual ratings calibrated-- it\\'s often easier to compare two players overall than on the basis of specific attributes.",

Capability of keeping players on the same or different teams as well as balancing male/female ratio makes customizing teams easier. Developer support is great!",

We have anywhere from 15 to 25 players at the moment, and it cuts the picking time down as well as preventing those unfortunate and pesky \\\"I got picked last\\\" feelings.",
