        "comment": "Don\\'t waste your time. Great concept, but I was given the card by a cashier at Orleans Street location in Baltimore. But the cashiers at that same location have no idea how to use the pay with card feature (cash on card instead of points). A shift supervisor told me the card couldn\\'t have cash on it, that she had been working there for four years, does this every day, and when I tried to show her the app, brushed me off. I left without food & called the support line. I want my remaining balance back.",
