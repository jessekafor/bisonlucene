    "description": "Emergency Communications for smartphones âStuff happensâ Hurricanes, floods, tornados, earthquakes, shooter on campus, hockey riots and more. We live in wildly unpredictable times. When stuff happens near you, having the best information can help you get out of harmâs way. People will help people in times of trouble ELERTS allows people on the street to make a difference by sharing what they see during an emergency. By using smartphones with cameras, GPS and mapping, average citizens can become Citizen Reporters in an emergency or disaster. Sharing what you see can help others. Traditional emergency systems were designed to push instructional messages out, with little or no involvement by the public. ELERTS has knocked this outdated model over, by employing smart phones and social media networks to bring the public into the process. With ELERTS, anyone can become a citizen responder, helping others by sharing information and helping Emergency managers to spread the word on how to get out of harmâs way. * We are experiencing a revolution in mobile communication technology, yet most ER systems still focus on pushing automated messages out by the lowest common denominator technology, SMS. They have done little to embrace the new mobile technology that allows two-way communications. Given the rapid adoption of smart phones and the explosion of social media, this is a problem that should not exist today. * The best ER system will combine traditional command-and-control messaging to first responders and public safety staff, with a readily available, easy-to-use, two-way communications that engages large segments of the general population in the response process. * ELERTS two-way mobile communication turns citizens into assets vs. liabilities, in a crisis. ELERTS features * Emergency alerts from official sources: - - NOAA (severe weather) - - USGS (earthquakes) - - EPA (radiation levels) * Crowdsourced alerts - - People with smartphones sharing info - - 2-way communication * Photo taking & photo sharing emergency * Map showing how close you are to emergency * Emergency resources - - Red Cross - - FEMA - - NOAA - - Ready.gov - - Alaska & Pacific Tsunami Centers * Choose locations to monitor for emergency - - Every college in USA - - Every city and town in USA * Alerts by type - - Crime - - Earthquake - - Explosion - - Fire - - Flood - - Medical Emergency - - Power outage - - Shooting - - Suspicious activity - - Tornado - - Unattended bag or package - - Vehicle accident * And more. ELERTS â the right tool for the wrong situations. Why wouldnât you install this free app?",

        "comment": "This app is part of a much larger system, the \\\"console\\\" for which, when purchased by a local government, can make it a superior tool for notifying citizens and first responders of a problem; and which also lets citizens report problems.  I don\\'t know what the console costs (though I\\'ve asked for a quote), but now that I\\'ve read on the company\\'s web site how it all works, and have played with the app a little, I can see, right now, that it\\'s an unbelievably good concept.  The Android app, alone, though -- even when not part of one\\'s local government\\'s use of the console -- is still pretty cool.  However, it has a few issues (which I\\'ve reported to the company for remediation; and said issues are why I only gave it 4 stars), to wit:  One must delete alerts one-by-one, using each individual alert\\'s red \\\"Delete\\\" button.  Instead, each alert should have a checkbox; and there should be a \\\"check all\\\" button; as well as a \\\"check by alert category\\\" capability.  Also, what \\\"around me\\\" means should also be refinable:  I\\'m getting the same wind/frost alerts for all nearby communities.  The app uses the \\\"back\\\" button wrongly; and force closes a lot.  It\\'s a GREAT idea, but needs some work.",
