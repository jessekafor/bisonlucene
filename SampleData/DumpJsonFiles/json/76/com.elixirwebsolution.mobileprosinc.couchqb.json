    "description": "Test your football knowledge and BE THE QUARTERBACK on game day. This app puts you into 25 different situations on the grid iron. You have the power to make the tough decisions needed to lead the team to victory. Each situation offers a multiple choice of four different plays. Each play could result in a positive or a negative result. Which play will you run? This is not a video game, but a decision making test of your football expertise. It's easy to sit back on the sofa and criticize the decisions of professionals. This app was written by a football expert. The results of each decision are based on statistical historical data and common football sense. Just remember, you can't control everything. Sometimes you can make the right decision and still watch your team drop the ball. Good luck, and enjoy being the Couch QB!",

Although u MUST have a vast understanding of what plays work in various situations.  Only gripe is the same play that worked once may not work 2nd time through.  But fantastic job!",
