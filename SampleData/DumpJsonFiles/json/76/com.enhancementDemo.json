If you find any bugs or issues please e-mail me (miscanalysis@gmail.com) and include what you were doing at the time the bug occurred so I can fix it.#### Description #####SEA lite frequency analysis has a selectable resolution from 128 to 4096 bands, between 0-4 kHz. This tool is great for audio engineers, anyone with a background in linguistics (phonology or phonetics), cognitive psychology (psycholinguistics), speech and music analysis or Digital Signal Processing (DSP). It is a useful tool for off-line frequency analysis of acoustic signals and a powerful educational aid for students in those fields of study. You can record, distort, enhance and modify your own voice, giving you the ability to hear and see each step you take. One of the frequency analysis tools available is the spectrogram. The spectrograms generated in SEA are very high resolution, allowing the user to observe harmonics and the fine structure of their recordings.Initially it was designed for students and researches in Electronic/Electrical Engineering, however, anyone can try their hand at using it. It incorporates some past and present state-of-the-art speech enhancement algorithms which allow you to filter out noisy signals and see and hear the result of these algorithms first hand. Some of these algorithms are currently used in some telecommunications systems.You can quickly make changes and share them with colleagues or teaching staff via e-mail, Blue-tooth and any other supporting image or sound transfer services. All spectrograms and frequency plots are zoom able via an image viewer.Complete list of features in V2.0.1:- complete spectrogram analysis- complete short-time magnitude analysis- Distort recorded audio with different noise types from -30dB to +30dB- Additive noise types include:+ White noise+ Babble (human voice)- Exporting of configuration as txt file- Short-Time Fourier Analysis on all generated audio- Real time amplitude recording- dBFS scale on all spectrograms- Viewing and sharing of all images and audio- The following Advanced filters:+ spectral subtraction+ Frequency Wiener filter- The following acoustic modification methods:+ Unit Magnitude+ Random Phase+ Zero Phase- Peak frequency tracking - Generate spectrogram png files- Generate .wav files- comprehensive help and documentation - Video tutorials",

I like the ease of use and the specto graphs are remarkably detailed, clearly alot of thought went into this app and i can imagine the importance this app would have for a university student studying a related field. Well done all round",
