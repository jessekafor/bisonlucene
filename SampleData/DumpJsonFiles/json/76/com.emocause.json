        "comment": "This app lays out a bunch of pseudo science, complete with ad-hoc explanations of actual medical conditions- according to this app, a child who wets the bed does so from an instinct to mark his territory. Seriously.  What is worse, the app makes you purchase the full version if you want the solutions to resolve these kind of problems.  In summary, this app is the inevitable result people curious enough to ask questions, but too lazy to find scientific answers.",
