    "description": "THIS IS INTENDED FOR TABLETS- Meeting notes is the must have for anyone who attends meetings. The application allows you to setup meeting attendees and agenda items. During the meeting just check off the attendees when they arrive and as you move through your agenda keep your notes. Notes can be stored in two ways public and private. Now you can also freehand a drawing or limited notes for a topic. The public notes and freehand notes can be combined automatically from all of the agenda items into meeting minutes that can be saved as a PDF. Don't have internet connection at work no problem, all of the data is stored on the device and even pdf generation is done on the tablet. Now you can apply your custom logo to the generated meeting notes.We are working hard to make future improvements. Please stop by our website to see the enhancements we are working on or to suggest some of your own.",

        "comment": "This is a great concept.  The interface this app provides looks functional and has great potential.  I have tried to submit a couple of comments via the app then after a couple of weeks of waiting have heard nothing from the developer and seen no updates.  My impression so far is this app was a great attempt at a great idea but, they didn\\'t finish it & just threw it out there to collect money and have forgotton about it. Acer A500 with honeycomb.

        "comment": "Very slick looking, and functioning app, for the most part  There are issues with changing fields on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, some wonky logic for deleting items (slide to the left, apparently this is from WebOS) and  the output options could use reformatting and/or an option to output to a TXT file.  However, the developers are very cooperative and actively updating the app to address the issues and add new features.",
