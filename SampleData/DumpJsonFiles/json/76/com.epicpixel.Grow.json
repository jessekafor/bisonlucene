No investing required other than that single dollar. Way better than Angry Birds. If you think the adventure is easy, hit up the survival mode and see if you got what it takes to make the leaderboards.  The single con is the game can\\'t rotate the opposite way. I find myself touching my menu keys half the time during a really intense game.",
