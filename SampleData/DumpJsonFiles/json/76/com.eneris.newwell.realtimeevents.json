        "comment": "I have been using this app as my training guide to help monitor my training volume.  This is the only automated version of Banister\\'s Training Impulse (TRIMP) I have ever seen.  Using a % of HRR has made this app the most accurate training tool on the market.  It\\'s not intuitive and requires a bit of setting up, it also requires the details entering quite a few times before it starts to remember me.  Overall once working, it is excellent.",

        "comment": "Suunto products are not remarkably known for their intuitiveness or ease of operation, but for their accuracy. When I bought my first Suunto HR monitor (T3c) I had to read the whole manual to make it work properly. In fact, it was maybe a week when I found out that I could get a readout of my time during each training zone if I configured the watch correctly. But then, when I made it work well, what a change it did on my running. The training effect is what does it for me. This app, well the first time I opened it I was tempted to uninstall it. Then I took a run with the Suunto Hr Belt on after figuring out it got paired almost instantly... As an afterthought I started the Stopwatch. When I finished I sent the move to movescount. I then got home and looked at my move in my desktop and it was as if I had synchronised a Suunto T6. Epoc, Vo2Max, Peak Training effect... And of course, distance, route and all the other stuff you do normally get in these apps. If you own an Xperia Active or a smartphone with an Ant sensor and a Suunto Hr monitor  you owe it to yourself to try this app, specially if you already use Movescount. If it had voice support I would give it 5 stars.",

        "comment": "I wish I could give you details, but the program did not work at all.  It did not register a GPS signal, even though other running programs did.  The map had me in Finland instead of New York.  Worse, it did not pick up the signal from my Suunto, even though my watch was registering my HR.  Everytime it failed, I would close out and reopen the program.  It kept asking for my login information (shouldn\\'t it be stored?).  I doubt there are identity thieves trying to get running times and distance.  Finally, There is no way to change from metric to imperial units, so do your metric conversions before you are out on a run with this program.  It is a worthless program that has a frustrating user experience.",
