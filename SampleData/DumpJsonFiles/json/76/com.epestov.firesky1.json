        "comment": "It\\'s there any way to add options to it, like changing the color of the flames, smoke, ash.... that would be really awesome, OR maybe keep this one as is and make a separate app with them options, without the ads, but make that one cost, for people to buy.!? I know I would purchase it, and I think others would also.!! ;) Just a suggestion and request.! Thank you for making this, and for it being free.! ~Yvonne<3",
