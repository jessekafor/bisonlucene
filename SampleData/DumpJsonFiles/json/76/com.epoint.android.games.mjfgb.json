Tiles are rendered in high quality unlike most of the other Mahjong  apps.   Also all player walls are visible and tiles put down are easily visible. Gameplay is good with the app informing you of winning tiles. AI is quite strong and doesn\\'t appear to cheat.  App informs you of what sets are worth and gives a small summary at the end of each game.",
