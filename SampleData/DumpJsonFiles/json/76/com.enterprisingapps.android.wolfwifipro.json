I did not want to purchase yet, but watched the videos and figure, sure.  Bought it, and it works.  Devs listen and take feedback, plus it sounds like they have an active roadmap for this project.  You can use your own floor maps.  Does heatmaps of signal, speed, etc.  Also can develop maps of equipment in your organization.  Just want ability to use POs now (education)",
