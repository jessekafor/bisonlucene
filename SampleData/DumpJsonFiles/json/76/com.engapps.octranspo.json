        "comment": "Useful for figuring out how long I\\'ll be waiting at the stop, but takes some futzing to do what I really want to do - trip planning.  With GPS it could be a great real-time-updated trip planner. Even just a feature to tell me when the bus I\\'m on will get to a specific stop would be a great start.  However it\\'s still a decent basic app for finding out where a given bus is, and worth the modest price for that.",
