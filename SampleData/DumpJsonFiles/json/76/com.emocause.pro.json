        "comment": "This application has been very useful, as it has aided me in quickly finding emotional connections to the physical manifestation of illness. It has aided me learning in a more direct way about Meta-Medicine. It is expensive as far as apps go but worth every penny. Rob von Overbruggen has made sense of a complicated subject and created a tangible tool.",
