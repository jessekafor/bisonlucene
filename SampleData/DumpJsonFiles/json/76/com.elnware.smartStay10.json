    "description": "Sorry For the issues due to the Merging. We care about users and that's why we are bringing back the OLD Smart Stay Lite. Update to v.1.0.4 If you like the app and want to buy the pro. Please refer to: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beansoft.eyespyThis is the latest version with new goodness in it. :)our new lite version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beansoft.eyespy.freeSmartStay Ex is an easy to use and free app that implements one of the coolest features in Samsung Galaxy S3, the Smart Stay. The feature uses the front facing camera to detect whether the user is looking at the phone and if the user is, then Smart Stay makes sure the phone screen stays on so the user can continue to read or do whatever they were doing. If not, itâll shut the screen off. It thus more accurately controls the screen based on how the user is using it and you can get rid of the annoying action of having to turn on the screen or touch the screen so that your screen stays on.Features: * Double checking - preventing screen off from accidental fail detection with double checking feature.  * Idle time feature - allows app to intelligently run the scanning when the device is idle. * Low Light support - Help the app to function properly under low light environment. * Exception List - This allows you to specify which app you don't want the app to run on. * Debug Mode - Allows you to easily see what went wrong with  the detection. * Customizable Polling Time - Enable you to specify the time out customization. * Premium Support. ****** PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THE LITE VERSION ******IF YOUR DEVICE IS NOT LISTED OR SHOWN AS NOT WORKING IN THE LINK BELOW, IT IS LIKELY THAT YOUR DEVICE IS NOT YET SUPPORTED AND MOST LIKELY IT WON'T  WORK. COMMENTING THAT IT DOESN'T WORK ON YOUR PHONE AND RATING IT WHILE IT'S NOT SUPPORTED WON'T HELP. IF YOU WANT YOUR DEVICE TO BE SUPPORTED, YOU CAN CONTACT US. WE WILL WORK ON MAKING IT WORK. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AipvJS5dHYPrdE1sUDF5LUs4NVFnd1lVXzZGQnEyRmc&output=html***************************************************************************DON'T DOWNLOAD THE LITE VERSION FROM OTHER WEBSITES OTHER THAN ANDROID MARKET. IT'S NOT UPDATED AND BOUND TO HAVE ISSUES. Thanks. Please don't comment on google play, we are unable to provide a guide or solution here. Send an email to me, i will respond ASAP. Thanks. Keywords: Iseeyou, smart stay, Samsung.",

        "comment": "Tried Smart Stay Lite ex, same results.  Galaxy S3, custom ROM, AOKP JB 4.2.2  App status bar icon blinks once, and then screen never turns off.  Even when placed face down on a flat surface, after two minutes, I peek under the phone, screen still at full brightness.  Reason for trying this app was that I lost the stock ROM Smart Stay function, was hoping to get that function back with this app.  But it\\'s simply not the case.  If it\\'s any help, the LOGCAT shows that this app is trying to take a picture, but it\\'s getting java errors:  W/System.err( 2098): java.io.IOException: setPreviewTexture failed W/System.err( 2098):    at android.hardware.Camera.setPreviewTexture(Native Method) W/System.err( 2098):    at com.elnware.smartStay10.o.run(Unknown Source) W/System.err( 2098):    at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:725) W/System.err( 2098):    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:92) W/System.err( 2098):    at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137) <snip>  I can provide full logcat if requested.",
