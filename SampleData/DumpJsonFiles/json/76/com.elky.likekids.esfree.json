        "comment": "Ignore the complaints and try this if you really want to learn Spanish. The reason there aren\\'t English translations is that the app is forcing you to THINK in Spanish. You\\'re concepts in Spanish as you go. You might not know what a word means at first, but you begin to figure out it\\'s meaning after seeing it used with different images. Associating Spanish words directly with images and concepts (instead of their English equivalents) is the only way to become fluent. Amazing app!",

Nobody talks that!!  It\\'s an insult to adult learners\\' intelligence to present this as learning material.  Valuable space is taken up on the app where REAL LIFE HELPFUL SENTENCES could\\'ve been used instead. I do wonder if stock photo was bought & then sentences just plucked from the air to fit in with the pictures rather than constructing out a course with proper sentences & then obtaining photos that fit in with them.  The writing exs don\\'t work but the majority of the app is very good for supplementing your spanish learning so in spite of the flaws, i plan to buy the full version & i do recommend it to those with basic knowledge of spanish, otherwise you might be lost.  But if it were not for these ridiculous sentences, i\\'d be rating this a 5.  These comments also apply to the rest of the apps in this series.",
