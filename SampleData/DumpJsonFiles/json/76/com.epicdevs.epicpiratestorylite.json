Â Now it is your time to become a great leader and gather a party of hardened pirates to take his place away from him. Â On your journey you will have to master difficult battles with barracudas, mermaids, strange undead, monkeys, Indians and fearsome pirates. Â You start on an lonely island with a small boat. Over time your party and town grow until you are powerful enough to encounter A.Blizzardo. Â Gather powerful weapons, build crazy buildings, hold funny events and become the pirate king.This is the first game from the studio Epic Devs. We hope you enjoy your stay in our game and savour the awesome pixel art, which will remind you of the unique Kairosoft games and their artwork. Â Epic Pirates Story should show you the potential of our team, and we hope that you will enjoy all the upcoming titles that we are working on like: Epic Movies Story, Epic Car Story and The Conquest: Colonization.",
