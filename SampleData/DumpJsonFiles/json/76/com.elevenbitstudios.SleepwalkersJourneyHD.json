        "comment": "Maybe just me but when usually the return button is tapped on any phone; any app that\\'s running shows the option to quit or not(in the title screen of the app), but in this one when I do that it just returns to the my phone\\'s home screen and the RAM manager shows that the app has \\\"MINIMISED\\\" but not \\\"QUIT\\\". I mean where is the option to quit the game? If I get an answer I\\'ll give a 5-star on this issue.",
