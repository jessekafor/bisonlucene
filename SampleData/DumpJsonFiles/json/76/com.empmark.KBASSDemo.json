        "comment": "No Pro version (that I can find) and this version adds \\\"This message sent via KBASS(An Android Market App)\\\" to the end of every response, effectively reducing the amount of information you can send by about 50 characters.  Nice try, but until someone figures out how to send either longer texts, or multiple texts per key word, this app is only for those who want to give the quick, 160 minus 50 character response.  Not for me.",
