You can still download the app and find great BBQ joints, though!** If you love finding great BBQ joints (and talking about them), this is the app for you. Built from the ground up expressly for the smartphone-enabled BBQ enthusiast, the Texas Monthly BBQ Finder will help you discover, discuss, and debate the best BBQ joints in Texas--and worldwide. Just one tap of the screen will deliver up all the BBQ joints near you--and what everyoneâs saying about them. Nobody knows BBQ like TEXAS MONTHLY, which has been obsessively covering the pitmasters of the Lone Star State since the 1970s. This app draws on those decades of experience, with reviews of hundreds of the top joints in Texas, plus detailed info on thousands more. But it also puts YOU in the driverâs seat. Who do YOU think is serving up the best BBQ right now? This app helps you share your own BBQ discoveries with friends, post your own reviews, debate with other users, keep track of your favorite joints, and much, much more. The Texas Monthly BBQ Finder is the app no connoisseur of smoked meat should be without.

Letâs find out.- The âBuzzâ feature is your chance to peek inside the hive mind of BBQ junkies.

This feature also enables discussion and debate between users.- The Texas Monthly BBQ Finder is also web-based, so now you can waste hours of your workday arguing with other BBQ hounds about who has the best pork ribs in Dallas, then carry the same conversation out the door on your smartphone.
