Also transactions disappear, won\\'t synch. Contacted the developer about not getting into dashboard, was told they were looking into it. That was over a month ago. Contacted them again about a refund and they told me to request a refund from itunes? Then followed that with an email asking if I installed the latest update? what does that have to do with not being able to sign into the dashboard from a PC? ridiculous!!

It really is a great little app that is easy to use. No problems on my nexus 7. Emailed a couple of suggestions on changes like date format living in the UK, dd-mm-yy, but nothing that\\'s major. Great app. No regrets.",

I had extremely fast response from the developer when I first contacted them, but they were unable to get any fixes to work, and then made constant excuses for themselves...\\\"I\\'m the only developer\\\". Well then perhaps you should stick with one app until you get it right!    I paid for both the ipad and android versions, neither of them work correctly and they definitely don\\'t sync up. But neither one even works correctly on it\\'s own, without trying to sync them up. If you edit a transaction, it both creates the new expense and keeps the old one in the list. If they\\'re recurring, that means the budget winds up wanting to pay my electric bill 17 times per month by next April!    I\\'m very very disappointed. This developer needs to learn that apps should be free until they work!",
