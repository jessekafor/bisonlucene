However you are limited to one custom map (reasonable) but only 5 Data points (unreasonable) this should be raised to 10.  After frustration of trying to use those 5 Data points to get a good Idea for how well the app functions, I eventually got a vague impression of the app.  Big + UI lets you tap location on static image.  Bought $50 Full Version in the end, worth it if you plan to do a large area.",
