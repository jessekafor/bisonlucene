The competing product (Touchdown) seems as good with mail but retains Notes.  If there isn\\'t movement on this by the time the trial expires (30 days), I\\'ll probably not come back.  Are you listening to your customers, Emtrace????  It shouldn\\'t necessary to buy Exchange/Notes compatibility in the first place",

I\\'m not sure whether I would even like it to be redesigned for ICS so good it is. There is an alternative client - Touchdown, but that one was made by idiots who don\\'t have taste. It looks like my first homepage from 90\\'s with the same amount of bugs and dumbass approach probably made by their grandmothers. If you want a good Android client don\\'t look anywhere else, it\\'s worth every penny.",
