When I check the answer, it has changed it such as I will answer \\'animal ambulance\\' and when I check it tells me I selected mountain rescue, and similar on stopping distances. But in all a great app!",

The answer text does not wrap and is being truncated, so often you can\\'t see enough of the answer to get the question right. 2. The summary of how well you did for road signs does not indication if you got the right answer or what the right answer was. 3. Other apps of the same type give you immediate feedback of if you got the question right or wrong.  In this app if you choose to answer 20 questions you only know if you got them right after question 20.",
