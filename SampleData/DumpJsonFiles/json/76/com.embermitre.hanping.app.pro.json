        "comment": "Very Good - my favorite Chinese dictionary app that I cannot live without!\\tWell thought UI and good functionality. Happy to support development by paying little bit for the pro version of the application.  Suggestion: I wish the favorite words would be marked in the search result lists.   Update: Efficiency impact could be managed by making this configuration option. There could be two rounds in producing the search result list. One round to start generating and showing the search result, the second to mark the favorite words in the result list. If the result list were above some threshold length, the markings could be disabled.  Suggestion2: Typical use case for me: I switch between instant message application and Hanping dictionary. I use this app as a tool to help with translation. I just copy & paste the Chinese message and find it cut in pieces with translation for each word or simple phrase. For longer message this does not work any more conveniently though, because the distance between the pasted message and the fragments. If the original text could be read from the presentation of the fragments (which would then need to show numbers, punctuation, repetitions in some way etc), this use case would work very well. Configuration option again?",
