    "description": "Original game that requires from you both skill and intelligence.In a kind of universe scenario the player will have to telecontrol a ship to complete the mission of saving astronauts lost in space.Be careful with the gravitation forces of the planets. Attractive, repulsive and high density planets will complicate your mission of moving from sector to sector looking for astronauts to be rescued.Have fun moving the ships by tilting your device slightly. Nevertheless, you don't need to play with the device flat on its back, instead the resting position (i.e. when the ship forces aren't present) will be your current orientation when each game level starts.You'll need skill to get the desired ship's movement taking into account the applicable sum of forces as well as the inertia.You'll need intelligence to select the most appropriate way to complete each galaxy before running out of food.This is just the beginning... try Gravit Action.",
