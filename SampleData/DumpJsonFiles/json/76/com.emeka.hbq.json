    "description": "***Check out our new app - \"Animal Hooray\" - which has sounds and pictures of 110 animals plus 1,100 facts about the animals ***Can you answer 100 questions about the human body? Surely, you know how many eyes you have. But do you know how many lobes you have in your left lung? Dont panic! We are not going to drill you like a medic. So relax and have fun with our carefully selected 100 questions about your body. As with all our quizzes, we do not want to bore you with zillions of questions. Instead, each quiz is just 100 questions on a particular topic, packaged in a neat app. We like to call it the âDisposable Quizâ package.And you know what? Because, several research studies show that apps are used mostly once, and then left to clutter the screen, we are making it easy for you to keep your screen nice! Yea right!  So once you have attempted the 100 questions, and you are happy (or sad â we donât really care) of your scores, go ahead and press the âUninstallâ button at the end. And of course go immediately and download the next 100Q quiz.If you like our quizzes and want to send us your own quiz title plus questions, then visit www.100q-quiz.com or send us an email on support@100q-quiz.com ThanksYours sincerelyChief Quizmaster",

I was looking for an app that would help me remember the finer details of the human body, this app is all over the place, they ask about a bone, then a cell then skin type, its not very cohesive. It helps pass time if ur bored.",
