PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reinvest the 25000 dollar prize into your business and continue developing the app, unlike most app development prize winners in Kenya that disappear after winning a prize. Make that 25k into millions! Right now the bargain section already has errors and savings of 1/- on some items. Get your money working, get the latest prices from all the supermarkets etc and best of luck hope to use your app for a long long time!",
