Ron Paul, an eleven-term congressman from Texas, is the leading advocate of freedom in our nation's capital. He has devoted his political career to the defense of individual liberty, sound money, and a non-interventionist foreign policy. Judge Andrew Napolitano calls him \"the Thomas Jefferson of our day.\" After serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s, Dr. Paul moved to Texas to begin a civilian medical practice, delivering over four thousand babies in his career as an obstetrician. He served in Congress from 1976 to 1984, and again from 1996 to the present. He and Carol Paul, his wife of fifty-one years, have five children, eighteen grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.Ron Paul, the New York Post once wrote, Ron Paul is a politician who \"cannot be bought by special interests.\" \"There are few people in public life who, through thick and thin, rain or shine, stick to their principles,\" added a congressional colleague. \"Ron Paul is one of those few.\"******  Note from the developer  ********I have spent the past decade searching for the most credible sources of information that were able to predict major political and economic changes.  In my search I found Ron Paul, a true hero who has fought for our rights and freedoms for the past four decades, even when nobody seemed to notice or care.  Ron Paul speaks the truth and he has consistently forecasted global crises because he is a scholar of Austrian Economics and a clear understanding of how our Federal Government functions. If you are someone who is looking for truth and understanding, I have created this app for you and I hope you like it.Thanks,Dan Chen",
