    "description": "This application easily and quickly enables WiFi Tethering hotspot AP in 1-Click. It supports most Android phones, including the lastest Jelly Bean devices!Use it to get Internet connection on Windows, Mac, another phone or tablet, Ubuntu, Wii, PS3 and a lot more, everywhere. One of our users use it in the woods and dance with xBox live! What a wonderful portable party!Perhaps the world's fastest, cleanest and lightest app for launching WiFi hotspot. We have reduced the app size to almost nothing.It does NOT require root access.If you want a secured connection with password protection, or be able to customize your hotspot AP name, please download the pro version here:http://goo.gl/XUpqYOr search \"1-Click WiFi Tether Pro\" in the store.Important: If this works on your unrooted device, please don't accept system updates, otherwise this application will be banned and will not be compatible with your new system any more. The only solution then should be to root your beloved phone. Its purpose is to avoid and replace the standard manual configuration, which requires at least 5 clicks everytime you need to start WiFi tethering, which might also ask you to enter some text to configure the WiFi hotspot.If you use this application, you only need 1 click without entering anything. We have tested it mainly with European carriers. It works on most devices with Android 2.2 or higher. Whether it works is really carrier or device specific. Please do not give it a bad rating. Thanks:)Possible reasons if it doesn't work :1. Your operator doesn't support WiFi tethering and blocks it on purpose.2. Your phone's 3G connection is too weak.3. Your system ROM had been modified by the manufacturer4. You don't have a data plan on your SIM cardRobot fans, home automation lovers, geeks or Android developers, please visit our blog:http://www.diyphonegadgets.comâââââ ScottyB Apr 9 Galaxy Nexus5 star for first try!
