She is a trainer of instructors worldwide for the ICP (Inline Certification Programme) and has taught thousands to skate in her UK skate school Skatefresh in London and Brighton. As an ex-figure skater in her teens, Asha has been skating for 30 years. These lessons are the culmination of her years of experience teaching and skating. Her teaching style is unique, direct and to the point and has been tested on many students with great success. Put an instructor in your pocket and see how much easier it all becomes. Let your practice time be truly useful and productive. You can only relax on your skates when your technique is good and you are skating well. This is when it flows, when your skates feel like part of you (and not separate). Your skating will then make you feel vibrant and alive.",
