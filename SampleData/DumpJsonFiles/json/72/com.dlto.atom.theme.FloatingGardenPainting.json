        "comment": "I think the Atom themes are the most beautiful themes for any launcher. Almost every theme I see I love, with other launcher themes I have to sort through tons of them to find a couple that are just okay. They\\'re launchers are so unique and I believe what people are really looking for...  Gorgeous themes that cater to the individual,  not the same theme everyone has on their android.  Love them!!!",
