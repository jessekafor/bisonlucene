        "comment": "The game itself is fun and it\\'s nice that it links up with Avengers Alliance on facebook via MarvelXP, but Marvel Games really needs to give Andriod some priority/attention. It\\'s been almost 2 months since the update with the invisible enemies for GS3 bug was released and still no patch or update. Also, the Captain America chapter has been out on iOS for almost 3 months and still no indication of coming to Android any time soon. Would be 5 stars if they just payed attention to and updated it.",
