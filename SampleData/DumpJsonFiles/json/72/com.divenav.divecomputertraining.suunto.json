To enroll in a class you need to purchase it via In App.Each DiveComputerTraining class is organized based on progressive learning and as such the user is recommended to follow the modules and sections in sequence. At the same time, the interactive organization of the class allows user to directly access a specific section for easier reference.A typical class will introduce the user to the dive computer, explain its indicators, review the settings step by step, show what to expect while underwater, and cover unexpected situations. Upon completion of the class, divers will feel more confident with their increased knowledge of their Suunto dive computer!",

        "comment": "This software is just a cover for iDive Computer, DivePAL and DveComputerTraining - all examples of rip off, half finished crap.  I doubt if Suunto actually know about this - I guess divenav is just ripping off their logo.  I would give zero stars if it were possible.  Is there somwhere on Google Play this type of rubbish can be reported to?  It should be deleted.  Utter Garbage",

        "comment": "This app has no useable function other than generating links to paid classes. The description intimates that there are functions in it pertaining to dive computers for free, plus available classes for a fee. The class cost statement further reinforces this notion. Dive computer classes are available at most reputable dive shops for free. Please spare the world another classless, childish and unprofessional response. Face it your app is a bait and switch.",
