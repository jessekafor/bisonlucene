    "description": "In Buddhism, buddhahood (Sanskrit: à¤¬à¥à¤¦à¥à¤§à¤¤à¥à¤µ buddhatva; Pali: à¤¬à¥à¤¦à¥à¤§à¤¤à¥à¤¤ buddhatta or à¤¬à¥à¤¦à¥à¤§à¤­à¤¾à¤µ buddhabhÄva) is the state of perfect enlightenment (Sanskrit: à¤¸à¤®à¥à¤¯à¤à¥à¤¸à¤®à¥à¤¬à¥à¤§à¤¿ samyaksambodhi; Pali: à¤¸à¤®à¥à¤®à¤¾à¤¸à¤®à¥à¤¬à¥à¤§à¤¿ sammÄsambodhi) attained by a buddha (English pronunciation: /ËbuËdÉ/ or /ËbÊdÉ/; Sanskrit pronunciation: [ËbudÌªdÌªÊ±É]  Pali/Sanskrit for \"awakened one\").In Buddhism, the term buddha usually refers to one who has become enlightened (i.e., awakened to the truth, or Dharma). The level to which this manifestation requires abstraction from ordinary life (ascetic practices) varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. In Theravada Buddhist traditions, it is held that the person attains this state on their own, without a teacher to point out the Dharma, in a time when the teachings on the Four Noble Truths or the Eightfold Path do not exist in the world, and teaches it to others. In contrast, certain Mahayana Buddhist traditions (particularly those that consider the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be paramount, which contains this concept) Buddhahood is considered to be a universal and innate property of absolute wisdom that is revealed in a person's current lifetime through Buddhist practice, without any specific relinquishment of pleasures or \"earthly desires\". Thus, there is an extremely broad spectrum of opinion on the universality and method of attainment of Buddhahood which is correlated to which of Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings that a school of Buddhism follows.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .KeyWords: photo gallery , wallpaper , Photography , manga, App 2 SD, APP2SD, APP TO SD.",
