        "comment": "I love how you can easily open and resize photos by sharing them to to the app, or opening recently captured photos from the launcher list or select photos from the gallery and even take new photos. Pretty much all bases are covered.    The app performs as advertised and resizes photos to my desired dimensions and even better the pics are sharper and don\\'t look as blurry as other resize apps on the market.  Plus I\\'ve made some cool art like effects before sharing my pics on Facebook. I definitely recommend trying this app.",
