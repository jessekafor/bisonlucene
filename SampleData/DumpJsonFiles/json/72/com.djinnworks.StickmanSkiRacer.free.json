        "comment": "I tried all stickman games from this developer and this is the best of the bad bunch but sadly thats where the good news ends. The game relies on its very well done graphics to get it thru but the game play mechanics are terrible. Your supposed to swipe to jump with the same hand ur already using to hold down the right side of the screen to accelerate lol. Hazards come out of nowhere so each levels a fluke if u get thru 1st time & not done on skill. You play a bit, hit hazard, die, re-play to get a bit further, hit hazard, die, & repeat this insane process till u FINALLY get thru a level. Camera needs to pull way back to see hazards in time. Just not enjoyable for me so un-installing which is a pity cos I really wanted to enjoy it but it\\'s just too frustrating",
