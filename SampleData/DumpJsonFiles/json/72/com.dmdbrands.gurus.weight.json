Also an undocumented feature is that you can go back and forth between the bar-code and the numbers by simply continuing to press the SCAN button with your toe or finger.  This scale rocks!  I thought it was a good deal without the ability to save the weight numbers in your phone.  Now it works great as advertised.  I purchased the scale around Jan 15 and I couldn\\'t be happier with its value having used it over 5 months.  Best scale ever. (Motorola Droid razr maxx)",

It is faster to note the data on a pad of paper and enter it manually into a spreadsheet, which defies the premise of convenient data gathering.",

The issue I\\'m having right now (in fairness, for the first time in two months) is that it needs to connect to a server, which makes no sense to me because there\\'s really nothing in this app that should require a connection. Using airplane mode allows me to get around this, but still.",
