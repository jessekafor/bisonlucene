    "description": "Use your Android as a simple mobile webcam, gsm camera or cloudcam via WIFI or Mobile Network!The picture stored in the cloud can be watched from everywhere with a browser or for example my App WebLiveWallpaper. Upload picture with various methods like http, ftp or Dropbox, send it with email or store on your sdcard for example to create a timelapse video.Use as simple but mobile timed webcam with refresh rates from seconds to hours, with motion detection or your defined daily activity times. High resolution pictures are also possible. Mark the pictures with text or image to advertise for your place or business.Very easy to use with opensmartcam.com or SENSR.NET.This app provides me with a simple possibility to mail someone (my wife) and start refreshing a webcam view of what I see with one buttontap. Also it can work as a more static webcam with set activity times and picture imprint if you got a spare or partially broken phone you want to place somewhere connected to power running all the time ...I will develop this further later after I fixed more bugs on my WebLiveWallpaper App.Easiest usage without much setup hassle is with sensr. Then you do not even need your own homepage/server!In the app press the MENU phone button for settings!Http setup for your own server:To enable your personal webcam put the included (see http settings in app or support forum thread) two files on your server.Your personal webcam is then viewable athttp://www.YOURSERVER.COM/WHEREEVERYOUPUTYOURFILES/Server address to be entered in Settings of App ishttp://www.YOURSERVER.COM/WHEREEVERYOUPUTYOURFILES/mobilewebcam.phpYou also have to enable the server to write to this directory - chmod!And you should really enable password protection for your website if you do not enhance the php page with some security measures (filesize limit, only jpg allowed, ...). Otherwise everyone can access your camera pictures and possibly even your server!Again:This webcam app is a bit different. It does not stream video. It is not meant to be placed next to or connected to your Computer. It will not have nice camera preview, fx or settings because old/broken androids can be used. This camera is intended to run without user (interaction) after initial setup possibly with a cheap 2G mobile data plan (in some countries/carriers for example 30 MB of data are free and that is enough to upload several pictures a day!).For unstable devices autostart and reboot after a number of taken pictures (my cheap jpad tablet for example crashes after about 70 pictures in a row) can be enabled in the settings.Go here to find some support:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=950933Android 1.5 up for old cheap hardware usage.Open Source: http://code.google.com/p/mobilewebcam-android/---Update history (important updates):+ gps location info for moving cams possible now+ integrated webserver (simple, first version, WIFI only)+ hex color input+ control Intents (com.dngames.mobilewebcam.START, STOP)+ night image detect, quality setting+ white balance+ timelapse video+ zoom, frontcam+ Background mode, Battery/Temp info+ SMS remote control+ experimental shutter sound mute+ autostart and reboot settings+ email pictures (no user interaction!)+ store pictures on sd+ motion detection fix+ print PNG from sdcard over picture for nice effect, advertisement or marking+ refresh rates throttle down until uploads finished",

        "comment": "My first impression of the app was very positive, having many options to meet different use cases. Then, after testing long time-lapse recordings, I found out it would sometimes crash, but that is potentially due to the old device I am using. After some tweaking with the settings, updating the Android version and an app bug fixing release, it now seems to be working well. The developer is dedicated to the project and making sure it works for as many devices as possible.  An idea for improvement would be to have combination of setups: being able to define different picture (tab) settings and different activity (tab) settings for different upload (tab) settings, so that for example you could define http/ftp uploads at low resolution every few seconds, high-res imaging to ftp less often and motion detection/intent events to e-mail, all running at once.  In any case, great work!",
