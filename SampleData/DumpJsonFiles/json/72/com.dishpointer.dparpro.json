It also helped to identify a reception problem (a tree branch that had grown across the line of sight - quickly resolved). Recommended.",

Check just the satellites you want to see and the app saves them so you don\\'t have to scroll thru hundreds of satellites to find the one(s) you want each time you run the app.  Huge when setting up a dish - its time consuming enough!  Highly recommend!",

        "comment": "I work at a Satellite Earth Station in Ireland and use Dish Pointer Pro to \\'see\\' the Geostationary Arc. It is a very useful aid to my work.  I recently upgraded my mobile phone to Samsung S4, and the extra shipped S-View cover caused the app to not work correctly. Please be advised that this cover interferes with the phone\\'s compass. It would be best to use the normal plastic cover that comes attached to the rear of the phone by the manufacturer, when using the Dish Pointer Pro App.   I have found the Dish Pointer App to be the best of its kind and I recommend it highly.

Also if your in a remote area without cell service it will over about a week not work due to not being able to authorize the account.
