        "comment": "Works fine on Galaxy 3 with the new X and E series of AV receivers. It communicate with the AVR through WiFi then uses the control through HDMI to control other devices connected to the AVR. What I like most is the ability to play music and control the AVR without turning the TV on. My only wish is they enhance the Pandora player to include Pandora\\'s full functionality such as see the play history and thumb the songs up or down.",
