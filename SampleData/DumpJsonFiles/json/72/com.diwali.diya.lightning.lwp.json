    "description": "Diwali Diya Live WallpaperDiwali (also spelled Devali in certain regions) or Deepavali,[note 1] popularly known as the \"festival of lights,\" is a festival celebrated between mid-October and mid-December for different reasons.[1] For Hindus, Diwali is one of the most important festivals of the year and is celebrated in families by performing traditional activities together in their homes. For Jains, Diwali marks the attainment of moksha or nirvana by Mahavira in 527 BCE.[2][3]Diwali is an official holiday in India,[4] Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, Suriname, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji.The name \"Diwali\" or \"Divali\" is a contraction of \"Deepavali\" (Sanskrit: à¤¦à¥à¤ªà¤¾à¤µà¤²à¥ DÄ«pÄvalÄ«), which translates into \"row of lamps\".[5] Diwali involves the lighting of small clay lamps (dÄ«pa in Sanskrit: à¤¦à¥à¤ª) filled with oil to signify the triumph of good over evil.[6] These lamps are kept on during the night and one's house is cleaned, both done in order to make the goddess Lakshmi feel welcome.[7] Firecrackers are burst in order to drive away evil spirits.[8][9][10] During Diwali, all the celebrants wear new clothes and share sweets and snacks with family members and friends.    The return of Rama after 14 years of Vanvas (banishment). To welcome his return, diyas (ghee lamps) were lit in rows of 20.    The killing of Narakasura: Celebrated as Naraka Chaturdashi, one day before Diwali, it commemorates the killing of the evil demon Narakasura, who wreaked havoc. Krishna's wife Satyabhama killed Narakasura during the Dwapara yuga. In another version of the belief, the demon was killed by Krishna or Krishna provoked his wife Satyabhama to kill Narshna, defeating Indra.debated with the villagers about what their 'dharma' truly was. They were farmers, they should do their duty and concentrate on farming and protection of their cattle. He said that all human beings should do their 'karma' to the best of their ability and not pray for natural phenomenon. The villagers were convinced by Krishna, and did not proceed with the special puja (prayer). Indra was then angered, and flooded the village. Krishna lifted Mount Govardhan and held it up to protect the people and cattle from the rain. Indra finally accepted defeat and recognized Krishna as supreme. Although this aspect of Krishna's life is sometimes ignored[citation needed] it sets up the basis of the 'karma' philosophy later detailed in the Bhagavat Gita.We have partnered with AppLovin Corporation to bring you a more socialexperience including but not limited to the ability to more easilyinvite your friends to our app, alerts from your friends, socialadvertising, etc. To serve you a better experience we may share yourpersonal data with AppLovin, and use of your data is subject toAppLovin's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
