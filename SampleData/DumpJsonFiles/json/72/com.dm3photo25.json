Generally, it represents the same tendencies that symbolism or decadence represented in France,  or decadentismo represented in Italy,  and may be considered the British version of the same style.  It was part of the anti-19th century reaction and had post-Romantic origins, and as such anticipates modernism. It was a feature of the late 19th century from about 1868 to about 1900.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .",
