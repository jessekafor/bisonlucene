Sunrise should not be confused with dawn, which is the (variously defined) point at which the sky begins to lighten, some time before the sun itself appears, ending twilight. Because atmospheric refraction causes the sun to be seen while it is still below the horizon, both sunrise and sunset are, from one point of view, optical illusions. The sun also exhibits an optical illusion at sunrise similar to the moon illusion.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .KeyWords: photo gallery , wallpaper , Photography , popular, fashion , App 2 SD, APP2SD, APP TO SD.",
