    "description": "Each year Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) host a spectacular array of music and cultural festivals, high adrenalin sports and exciting family entertainment. Make the most of your social calendar with the Itâs ON! Official Events Guide to Sydney & NSW from Destination NSW. The app showcases hundreds of events held throughout Sydney and NSW, all in real-time. Search for events by destination, date, event category and by a proximity search. Select âAround Meâ and set the distance from your location, to customise results. Alternatively search for events, by map or calendar view, to forward plan or drill down to a day or week and see all listings for that date range. Each event listing has detailed information including event type (e.g. festival), image gallery, event description, map, and contact details including emails, phone numbers and URLS. Plan the ultimate experience on the go, and prioritise what you want to see and do, around the rest of your trip, by saving your favourites to view offline. Check-in or share your experiences with your friends via Facebook or Twitter.",
