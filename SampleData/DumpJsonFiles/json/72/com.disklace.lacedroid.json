    "description": "Your Android device, like any other computer, is a storage device. Do not try to compare it to the huge storage devices yet, but very soon, we believe that most of your data will be held in your portable device with increasing capacity capabilities, and all other storage solutions will be used as backup or auxiliary storage. When this happen, you will find yourself having the same problems that current disk and storage users are familiar with, because no one likes to maintain data on disks, and evidently, you will find yourself in a problem.LaceDroid application was migrated to Android from the old world, and will be able to measure the data quality on your disks. It will alert in advance, before you see any problem symptoms, if you are close to the point of no return   that most of computer users had experienced in the past.In the near future, we'll introduce to Android users a new application that will take care of the disk maintenance that you'll need with larger disks. Please note that \"ROOT\" (Superuser) capability is required to run the  LaceDroid application.",
