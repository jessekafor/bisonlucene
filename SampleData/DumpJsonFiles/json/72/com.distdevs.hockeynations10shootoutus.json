Steve Jobs vision of affordable gaming and music holds as the new Google PLAY and I own a Galaxy Nexus and pre ordered a 7\\\" Nexus tablet and have 3 HTC phones and 6 Motorola phones so I am not a fanboy. I tell it as I see it and games are more on Play than the App Store compared to the market before Play. Not developers fault they were encouraged to sell it for $5. Probably fragmentation the reason too many phones to conform to.",
