Battlecruiser â A ship with battleship level armament and cruiser level armor; typically faster than a battleship because the reduction in armor allowed mounting of heavier propulsion machinery.    Battleship â A large, heavily-armoured and heavily-gunned warship. A term which generally post-dates sailing warships.    Cruiser â A fast independent warship. Traditionally, cruisers were the smallest warships capable of independent action. Now virtually disappeared from the oceans, along with battleships and battlecruisers.    Destroyer â A fast and highly maneuverable warship, traditionally incapable of independent action (originally developed to counter the threat of torpedo boats) but now the largest independent warship generally seen on the ocean.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .",
