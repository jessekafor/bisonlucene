        "comment": "This is a cool LWP!! If they say \\\"free\\\"... It\\'s free for only one day! You have the option to purchase! But 24 hrs to \\\"see\\\" how it looks on your phone is a goods deal. More devs should do this! DMF, Inc. are the BEST at these! Esp. in dragons! Don\\'t be fooled by copycats...cos there is one!!!!! I own alot of DMFs LWPs! And I blow the whistle on imposters out there! They can try, but never get the quality DMF will give you! :)",
