Like so many of lifeâs greatest swanky pleasures (i.e. sin and cocktails), the disco ball stormed nightclub decor during the â20s. As part from the general themes with the Roaring 20s, these party decorations were observed as being a well-liked accent to performing artists, for example, dancers and musicians.Throughout the 1930s and 40s, mirror balls were often seen in movies like a representation of glamor and glitz. They accompanied the large-scale dance numbers noticed in quite a few movies with the era. Adopted through the disco tradition, these devices were synonymous with the nightclubs and had been generally employed with other features such as fog machines and strobe lights.
