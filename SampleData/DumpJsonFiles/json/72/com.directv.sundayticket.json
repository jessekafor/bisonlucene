        "comment": "This app will only broadcast games held on a SUNDAY that ARE NOT nationally televised or locally blacked out. Plus you must have a subscription to Sunday Ticket MAX(not just Sunday Ticket) to watch on anything other than a TV. With that being said this app is awesome. Leaps and bounds in improvements on last year\\'s app. Crystal clear hi-def with the option to either watch in full screen or 2/3rd\\'s screen surrounded by other games/teams/players stats. Couldn\\'t be happier!",

I had hoped to use this program while at work to watch the Patriots play.  The need to watch it online is because I don\\'t have a TV at work.  Apparently due to zip code, if it is available on TV it is blocked on this app.  Kind of sucks!!!! If I was able to watch it on TV I wouldn\\'t need the app!!!  Otherwise, this app still sucks!!! You have to reboot constantly!!!!! I wish I could give it a ZERO!!!!!  I have used this both on a Motorola Xoom and a Nexus (first gen) 7.  Both do the same thing.  Its definitely the app.",
