    "description": "Share content like text, links or images via email, httppost, ftp, sftp, Dropbox or Box without further user interaction. No need to enter the target email adress every time you want to share something.Share offline: Delayed WIFI only sharing is possible.Like Google+ share your photos instantly after taking them (optional).How to use: Start app for settings and set up for example an email account.Open Gallery -> press MENU -> Share -> AutoShareOpen Webbrowser -> touch website address and hold until Share menu appears -> Share -> AutoshareSame in many other apps which offer sharing ...After activating New picture in the system settings you can also have your photos shared/uploaded instantly after taking them without further interaction (like google plus).If your @google.com email is not working - try @googlemail.com!Why is this helpful?Everyone is social now. Most of the time I am not. I often use the built-in Android share function to send stuff to myself. Or to my website.Everyone is using DropBox now. Most of the time I am not. I still use my own FTP for data exchange and storage.Everyone is sharing photos now. Most of the time I send simple text or links for later inspection to myself. All content is possible with AutoShare.This simple app enables you after a one time initial setup to share content with a single click on AutoShare.Advanced users: The http post method enables you to do EVERYTHING you can dream of with your shared content if you write your own php script receiving and processing the content (simple example php is included in the app settings). This method also keeps data traffic lower than processing everything on your Android or sending to multiple receivers. Upload pictures to your own gallery. Add links to your homepage. Send text to your blog. Share media. Try it.",
