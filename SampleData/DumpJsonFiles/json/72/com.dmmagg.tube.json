        "title": "ADWARE WARNING:LeadBolt makes unauthorized changes",
        "comment": "This could be a great downloader but I\\'ll never know because it installed hidden adware called LEADBOLT.  LEADBOLD ADWARE loads when you boot; can push popup ads to you without permission; can modify your desktop by adding program links for stuff you never installed; and maybe even make phone calls and send SMS to make you pay for stuff you don\\'t know about.  Oh, and it also can make changes to your browser, like changing your home page and default browser to something that lets them insert even more ads into your browsing.  A similar adware actually changed the DNS on my system so that they could access everything I did on my phone and \\'help me\\' by redirecting me to some dubious web sites that my security had to warn me about.  Nasty stuff that was hard to get rid of.  I had to wipe my whole phone to get rid of it.  So, this program, which wants a lot of excessive permissions, is on my security KILL ON SIGHT list.  It isn\\'t worth risking an infection that\\'s hard to track down, just for one of 100 similar programs that don\\'t all want to use my GPS and make phone calls in the background.  INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK",
