It combines the automatic fire of a machine gun with the cartridge of a pistol. The submachine gun was invented during World War I (1914-1918), but the apex of its use was during World War II (1939-1945) when millions of the weapon type were manufactured. Today the submachine gun has mostly been replaced by the assault rifle for military use. (The assault rifle uses an intermediate-power cartridge with more power than a pistol but less than a standard rifle or battle rifle.)Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .",
