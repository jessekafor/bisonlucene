    "description": "I made this battleship game for my sister, and now here it is, so you can enjoy it aswell, hopefully.There are different rules to the classic battleships game, so i thoughtwhy not add the different rulesets in one game.The settings menu allows you to customize the game rules, so you can playit the way you want. The first player to join a random game will get their rulesapplied to the match.To make it a bit different, i changed it from classic turnbased style. Insteadeach player make their move at the same turn, enabling the possibility of a draw match.credit:font \"airstrip\" provided by vicfieger from dafont.com",
