This can happen only during a new moon, when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth. At least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occur each year; no more than two can be total eclipses.  Total solar eclipses are nevertheless rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's umbra.The last total solar eclipse was the solar eclipse of July 11, 2010; the next will be the solar eclipse of November 13, 2012. The recent solar eclipse of June 1, 2011 and the Solar eclipse of July 1, 2011, were partial eclipses (see Types below); the next partial eclipse will occur on November 25, 2011.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .",
