    "description": "Four group of testing: \"Simple Figures Of Digits Group\",\"Geometry Group\",\"Animal Graphics Group\",\"Complex Figures Of Digits Group\"It suits the testing of the congenital color vision defects in conscripting soldiers, admitting students to the universities and the polytechnic schools and recruiting workers .Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the decreased ability to perceive differences between some of the colors that others can distinguish. It is most often of genetic nature, but may also occur because of some eye, nerve, or brain damage, or exposure to certain chemicals. Color blindness is usually classed as a mild disability, but in certain situations, color blind individuals have an advantage over those with normal color vision. There are some studies which conclude that color blind individuals are better at penetrating certain color camouflages .",
