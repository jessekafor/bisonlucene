It's simple , but very beautiful .Morning is the part of the day usually reckoned from dawn to noon. The name (which comes from the Middle English word morwening) was formed from the analogy of evening using the word \"morn\" (in Middle English morwen), and originally meant the coming of the sunrise as evening meant the beginning of the close of the day. The Middle English morwen dropped over time and became morwe, then eventually morrow, which properly means \"morning\", but was soon used to refer to the following day (i.e., \"tomorrow\"), as in other Germanic languagesâEnglish is unique in restricting the word to the newer usage.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .KeyWords: photo gallery , wallpaper , Photography , popular, fashion , App 2 SD, APP2SD, APP TO SD.",
