    "description": "Summary.1. This App can screen on / off without power button.2. You can use a pseudo \"Smart cover\" with feature combination3. \"Shake On\" mode eats many battery, but \"Magic On\" mode eat battery very little.----------------------------Caution.0. For remove this App, \"Use LCD Lock\" Option must be unchecked.or, setting -> Location & security -> Select device administrators and uncheck option.1. Must use free version \"Sensor LCD OnOff\" and,  If you are satisfied, please buy this App.  Because Your money is precious. ^^2. This App has no Ad Screen.  Setting screen will be show when you are click App Icon.3. Please remove free version \"Sensor LCD OnOff\" before install this App.- Usage.A. \"Shake ON\" mode1. for Nexus One : Hold volume key, and shake it. (Same with \"Volume+Shake\" mode)2. for other phone: just shake it. and.. To prevent unwanted turned on, proximity sensors are used. (it does not work when phone inside of bags, pouches, cases.)B. \"Magic ON\" mode - When The awareness of the proximity sensor \"close\" to \"far\",  turns on the LCD.1. When you pull out the phone from your pocket.2. When you shake hand on your phone's LCD (hi~)C. \"Volume+Shake\" mode 1. Only some phone is working in this mode. (ex. Nexus One) 2. hold \"volume key\" and shake phone. 3. if this mode is working, I recommend this mode than \"Shake Mode\" for power save.D. \"Magic Off\" option. 1. This option need \"Device Manager\" Permission. 2. If this option is activated, proximity sensor is working and \"close\" is maintaining given second, Screen will be lock. 3. This option is useful for people who use \"folder case\". E. \"No Lock\" 1. This Option can prevent Lock Screen. 2. \"Magic On\" + \"Magic Off\" + \"No Lock\" = almost \"Smart Cover\". in my opinion..    For settings, refer to first capture image. 3. If \"No Lock\" caused a problem, but other functions are useful,     remove and reinstall this app and do not use \"No Lock\" function. ^^    This App is depend on device's characteristic.F. When you attach the headset will turn on the LCD too.G Auto restart when phone rebooted.",
