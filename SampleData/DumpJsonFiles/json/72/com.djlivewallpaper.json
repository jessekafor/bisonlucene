High end CD decks now often allow the connection of USB memory sticks, external hard disks and computers. Electronic media such as mp3s is next in line. They can now be mixed using just a computer and some software or the use of a USB console mixer designed to work with a laptop running software. Personal preference probably is of paramount importance; if you're not comfortable and happy using the option you pick you just wont enjoy DJing and the learning process, so will have wasted your time and money. It would be worth saving up for longer if you can't initially afford the setup. Finally, if you have a limited budget there is nothing wrong with opting for a software setup with or without a console style controller.If you download â«'DJ Live Wallpaper'â«, you will get the best free DJ live walpapers there are!
