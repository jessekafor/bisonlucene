    "description": "*** PLEASE READ ***Why & Policy: This icon pack exists simply because most people hate the fact that icons are sized differently and shaped differently... So trying to follow a line using always stock icons as base to draw my icons i have created this pack and my intention is keep it always updated. My hope is that lot of people can agree with this project... The more we are the more pack grows up... If you like my work, my project and my ideas just buy it a the cost of a coffee and keep your launcher cool and updated... Also please share with your circles and on facebook the theme... I prefer one customer sized theme and regularly updated instead of tons of beautiful themes with few icons and abandoned after some weeks...âFeaturesâ:\tâª1200+ HD icons (144x144) (Growing with REGULAR UPDATES)        âªIcon Mask for other icons\tâª30 Fantastic HD Wallpapers included and 1000+ at the link :(https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/100106026474390425594/albums)\tâªfor Apex Only: Sense 5 font        âªfor Nova: 16 Dock Styles that you can select in settings\tâªUnicon (Icon Themer) Support - You Can Set Icons with ALL Launchers!\tâªIncluded in icon picker 18 Drawer icons to apply manuallyInstallation:Simple!
