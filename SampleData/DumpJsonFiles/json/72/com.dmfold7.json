        "comment": "The all has plenty of great ideas. But all it does is show you pictures of them (step by step yes, but unexplained pictures nonetheless) and there\\'s way too many ads for my liking. Also, the app adds app-ads to your homescreen, uninstalling. Is there anywhere I can get these DIys without this app?",
