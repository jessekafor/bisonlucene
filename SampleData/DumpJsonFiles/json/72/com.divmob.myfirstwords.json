You just drag and drop the right letters here.- The second one: Hint: There is no gray letters in right order, but when you drop a letter in the right place, it will be stick here otherwise it will not.- The third one: There is no hint at all: no gray letters, no stick effect. You have to find right order yourself. - Funny way to learn English words- Letters are pronounced when touched.- When word is completed, it's pronounced (you have to have TTS â text to speech - installed on your phone/table)",
