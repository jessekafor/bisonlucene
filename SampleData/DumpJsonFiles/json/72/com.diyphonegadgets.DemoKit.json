        "title": "Very Good App. NEED SOURCE CODE",
        "comment": "Worked very well with my HTC One. But for some odd reason, it forces itself into landscape mode even though I want portrait. Please do fix that issue. Other than that, I was able to control LEDs on my Arduino Uno with a SainSmart USB Host Shield. I would really like to see the source code of this app to develop my own.",

        "comment": "Despite saying it is compatible with my tablet [maxtouuch UW-A90 ICS 4.0.3] it does not work. Closes immediately. I may be wrong, but I think it is because these low-end Asian tablets do not have the correct USB drivers, even though they claim to support USB accessory. Many have no support at all for the product. I think it is best to get a Google nexus and an authentic Arduino mega ADK board.",
