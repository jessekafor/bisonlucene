    "description": "The battle of Gettysburg was fought over 3 days from July 1st-3rd 1863. It is considered the turning point of the American civil war, showing that the Confederates were not invincible, halting the invasion of the North, and providing the political popularity for Lincoln to be re-elected as president.This wargame allows you to play either side against the computer, or hotseat against another player. There is a map of the Gettysburg battlefield divided into hexagons, each representing about 500 yards across. The combat units are brigades, with each figure representing 100 men or 10 guns.Victory is achieved by the capture of flagged areas on the map (the flag indicates ownership) and also inflicting more losses.The game can be played with fog of war on or off, and options can be set for when the tardy Confederate cavalry commander, General Stuart, shows up (although this will also affect his Union cavalry counterparts).Game copyright Dave Kershaw, DK Simulations Ltd 2012.Artwork by Gonzalo Santacruz",

        "comment": "Just played [b]Battle of Gettysburg[/b] last night. The Graphics are basic but fine, not sure I like top down views. AI and back ground \\'mechanics\\' all seem to work authentically. Its cool to see the Generals and their units move, and see the log file updating, with losses morale degradation, and unit strength. The map looks good but it is a bit hard to tell hill tops given the crowded terrain. Once or twice I thought I was holding a hill, only to see larger than normal losses due t being charged down hill! ugh.  Arty is not very powerful, AI was smart enuff to avoid frontal assaults on it :( REALLY need an UNDO move button/option.  I like the movement indicators and how far you can move being shaded in. A couple of times I rolled back a turn to see if the AI would do the same thing twice. Never does. I think I like that from a replay perspective, plus the results of combats where they were the same also varied!  I feel like I got some good value at 1.99. And it is now on my radar to watch for new releases. If the designer teamed up with a UI/animation guy that would be very cool.",
