        "comment": "After buying one of your stickers and being misled into thinking it came in several colors, which it doesn\\'t, I noticed you charge for most of your stickers. They do nothing and most wallpapers cost less then what you charge. I bet you don\\'t get many buyers... What a rip off! I could understand charging $1 if they came with more designs, colors, but to get just one!? Insane! Most phones can change the size manually to. I want to know why you change so much for these? To can\\'t apply, these are widgets.",
