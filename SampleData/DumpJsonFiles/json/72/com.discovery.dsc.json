        "comment": "Of all the viewing apps from major TV networks, this one by far has the worst video player. Every time that a full episode reaches what would normally be a commercial break the video goes black, loops the last second of audio, and keeps doing this for up to a minute. Usually if you are patient, you\\'re video will resume, but not always.   I would expect much better quality coming from Discovery. The video player layout and disorganization of video clips and full episodes is really horrible.",
