Our mission is to produce a wide range of cultural, educational, and artistic programming within the District, including cultural preservation and documentary work that assures that the African American cultural legacy of Central East Austin is documented and honored into the future, all while bridging cultural gaps between Austin communities by disseminating this history to a broad-based audience.Our Vision is to be the premier producer of cultural programsâacross disciplinesâthat celebrate the richness of East Austin's history, showcase the contemporary creative community, and connect to traditions derived from African American Culture. By doing so, we will significantly contribute to the cultural quality of life of all Austinites and all who visit the District.Features:Our InformationEvent ListingsLocations",
