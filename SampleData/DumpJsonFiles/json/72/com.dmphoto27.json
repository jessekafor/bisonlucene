    "description": "A door god (simplified Chinese: é¨ç¥; traditional Chinese: éç¥; pinyin: mÃ©nshÃ©n) is a Chinese decoration placed on each side of an entry to a temple, home, business, etc., which is believed to keep evil spirits from entering.The door gods usually come in pairs, facing each other; it is considered bad luck to place the figures back-to-back. There are several different forms of door gods. The most frequently used are Qin Shubao and Yuchi Jingde (used on a pair of doors). The poster depicting Wei Zheng or Zhong Kui are used on single doors.Menu option: - Set as Wallpaper , - Full Screen , - Save to SD .KeyWords: photo gallery , wallpaper , Photography , manga, App 2 SD, APP2SD, APP TO SD.",
