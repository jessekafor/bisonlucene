    "description": "* Photo gallery of high quality \"Wonderful Guns\" images .* Play \"Wonderful Guns\" free Puzzles Game.* Set \"Wonderful Guns\" Live Wallpaper.Here we show you these Wonderful Handguns, Revolver, Submachine Gun, Sniper rifle Wallpaper.A handgun is a firearm designed to be held and operated by one hand. This characteristic differentiates handguns as a general class of firearms from long guns such as rifles and shotguns (which are mounted against the shoulder). A revolver is a repeating firearm that has a cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing. The first revolver (flintlock revolver) ever made was built by Elisha Collier in 1818. The percussion cap revolver was invented by Samuel Colt in 1836. This weapon became known as the Colt Paterson. The first cartridge revolvers finally were Smith and Wessons and were produced around 1856. A submachine gun (SMG) is an automatic carbine, designed to fire pistol cartridges. It combines the automatic fire of a machine gun with the cartridge of a pistol. The submachine gun was invented during World War I (1914-1918), but the apex of its use was during World War II (1939-1945) when millions of the weapon type were manufactured. Today the submachine gun has mostly been replaced by the assault rifle for military use. (The assault rifle uses an intermediate-power cartridge with more power than a pistol but less than a standard rifle or battle rifle.) In military and law enforcement terminology, a sniper rifle is a precision-rifle used to ensure more accurate placement of bullets at longer ranges than other small arms. A typical sniper rifle is built for optimal levels of accuracy, fitted with a telescopic sight and chambered for a military centerfire cartridge. The term is often used in the media to describe any type of accurized firearm fitted with a telescopic sight that is employed against human targets, although \"sniping rifle\" or \"sniper's rifle\" is the technically correct fashion to refer to such a rifle.Options: - Live Wallpaper .- Full Screen .- Save photo to SD .- Play Puzzle .",
