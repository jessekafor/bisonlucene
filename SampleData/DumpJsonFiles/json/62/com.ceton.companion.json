Remote piece works well but guide/search is missing standard features. Can\\'t set up faves or limit searches to channels you actually have.

However, the lack of a streaming recorded TV to a mobile device is becoming a serious drawback.  I have had my infinitv4 over 2 years and it feels like the whole home DVRs available from satellite providers and other cable providers now have more advanced features including streaming.  I am hoping this is added soon or any number of Echos  won\\'t keep me a customer.",

When it does work, it often takes multiple attempts to actually send the intended command.  The only thing it does reliably is schedule recordings. Not to mention they still haven\\'t made good on features that were supposed to work @ launch nearly nine months ago. I own the iOS version as well and is just as terrible.",

        "comment": "First off, good work on the app. Nice design, clean interface well laid out. A few things I would like to see that I know XBMC remotes have so I am not sure if these can be implemented (not marking down because these aren\\'t in the app) Now playing needs to be in there, would be great if it was something like Yatse with a widget as well, No Music library, this really needs to be added. TV that I have in my library (I did see this was in the client so very much looking forward to this). Streaming of content would also be a great addition. Remote needs to be in a light theme as it\\'s dark theme is an exact opposite of the rest of the app.All in all the best WMC app out there at the moment.",
