        "comment": "This application is an awesome way to log and track your workouts. Offers motivation to workout through prizes like a Precor EFX 5.23 Elliptical and now they\\'re giving away a LifeSpan Fitness S2 Spin Bike. You can join groups with friends or colleagues to stay motivated and you can even add your own prizes in your groups if you\\'re the administrator that started the group. I use it to keep my U-13 boys soccer team motivated to stay fit by using the prizes through the app!",
