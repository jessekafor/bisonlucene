        "comment": "Thanks, this compact app does as described and works well on Samsung GS2 phone and Nexus 7 tablet. However, the widget doesn\\'t appear to be available on the N7 (it\\'s fine on SGS2). N7 is running Android 4.1.1, SGS2 running 4.0.3. UPDATE: I\\'ve found that when a file is deleted, the file remains but with a zero byte file size. Also the widget icon status doesn\\'t update on the SGS2. As file deletion is a very basic function, I\\'ve revised severely my rating of this app downward.",
