    "description": "This is the best Skylanders figure reference app in the Android market. Just 10 new SWAP Force figures and a Lightcore Flashwing figure (with total of 208 figures/items, some of those figures' full set of pictures will be updated later). My Skylanders Collection is a must-have figure reference for the collectors and fans of the Skylanders games. This is the complete list of all the released figures. It helps you keep track of which figures you own, which ones are missing, and which ones you want! You can rank your favorite figures as well. **** FEATURES **** - Each figure has eight photographs taken from different angles. You can rotate each figure in two ways: by tapping on the right button to view the figure from each of the eight angles or by tapping on the left button to spin the figure automatically. - There are four different listings or views: the alphabetic one based on figures' names, the element one based on the element type of each figure, the rating one based on your rating for each figure, and the collection view. - The collection view indicates which figures you have so far, which ones are missing, and which ones are not released yet, all your owned figures are grouped together. A figure's name will be highlighted in magenta in the listings if you own the figure.  - When you are viewing any individual figure, you can go to the next or previous figure in the current listing by swiping left or right. Tap on the top right icon to display a group of console and power stats for the figure.   - This application works in both Android phones and tablets that support Android OS version 2.1-update1 (API Level 7) or later.

        "comment": "Excellent work! Easy to use, great clean look to the app, great sort modes to organize your collection and awesome psudo-3d views of the figurines.  There are definitely a few things that could be done to improve: * Would love to see \\342\\200\\230sort by game/series\\342\\200\\231 to separate SSA/SG/SSF figures. * Would like the ability to mark figures as \\342\\200\\230Want\\342\\200\\231, \\342\\200\\230Don\\342\\200\\231t want\\342\\200\\231, \\342\\200\\230Ordered\\342\\200\\231 or \\342\\200\\230Selling\\342\\200\\231 (and then sort by those) * Would love the ability to hide \\342\\200\\230chase\\342\\200\\231 figures (i.e. the glowing/flocked/mono-colored figures that aren\\342\\200\\231t different in game) from the lists.  Pro-tip: The favorites system is pretty flexible\\342\\200\\246 I\\342\\200\\231ve used it to categorize figures by series myself: Series 1 figures I own = 1 star, Series 1 figures I need = 2 stars, Giants figures I own = 3 stars, Giants figures I need = 4 stars, special variant figures I own = 5 stars and chase figures I never intend to find are unrated.  Despite my suggestions, it really is the best Skylanders app on the market by a fair margin. Definitely recommended.",
