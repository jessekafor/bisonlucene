    "description": "Take control of your finances today with PocketMoney. A powerful yet easy to use personal finance manager, PocketMoney lets you track your cash flow, understand your net worth, and improve the overall health of your finances on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, and now your Android device. Syncing to PocketMoney for Desktops (and to PocketMoney for iOS) will be part of version 1.1!The system is simple, and a minute a day using PocketMoney will help you navigate through the pitfalls of the current economy. âº Start by entering all your income and expenses as they happen across multiple accounts such as credit cards, savings, and checking accounts. PocketMoney can track thousands of transactions through many years of financial data with no performance loss. Transactions can be split across multiple categories, transferred across accounts and can also be scheduled to occur at regular intervals. âº Analyze your overall financial health by using the built-in reporting features of PocketMoney. âº If you use Quicken or MS Money, then you can export your desktop data to PocketMoney, enter data on the road, then export changes back to your desktop app via QIF files. (Quicken Essentials doesn't support QIF exports/imports.) Features Include: Accounts â Lite version limited to 2 accounts (full version is unlimited) â Accounts include credit cards, checking, overdraft, savings and more â Proven performance and responsiveness â Repeating transactions with complex logic (limited to 2 accounts - full version is unlimited)â Splits and Transfers â Reconcile and rollup your accounts. â Current, future, cleared balance displays â Customized account ordering, grouping and graphics â Customized transaction entry preferences â Custom filters Reports â Custom reporting for Accounts, Categories, Class and Payee Interoperability â Email Partner feature to share transaction with your partner (works between iOS and Android versions, too)â Email and SD card backup/restore â Import - TDF, CSV, QIFâ Export - TDF, CSV, QIF Usability â Multi-currency â Password protection â Transaction searchUpgrade to Full version to...â¢ Remove adsâ¢ Unlimited number of accountsâ¢ Unlimited number of repeating transactionsâ¢ Custom filterskeywords: budget currencies qfx checkbook ms quicken qif savings checks expenses pocket personal money cash ofx banking bank finance finances credit cards checking",
