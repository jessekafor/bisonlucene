    "description": "The Car Payment Calculator helps you negotiate like a pro by giving you access to an easy-to-use auto loan payment calculator and affordability calculator on your mobile device.  This free app contains two main features: 1. Calculate Monthly Payments based on the purchase price of the vehicle (Auto Loan Payment Calculator)This tool allows the buyer to determine the true total and monthly cost of the vehicle based on the sticker or negotiated price of the car.  * User inputs the car price, sales tax, down payment, trade-in, finance term and interest rate. * The app calculates and displays the monthly payment, the total interest paid and the total cost of the vehicle.* User may additionally input dealer fees, plate/registration fees and any other miscellaneous fees (i.e. optional two-year maintenance package) for the calculation.  2. Calculate the Target Purchase Price of the vehicle based on desired monthly payments (Affordability Calculator)This tool allows the buyer to set the maximum purchase price of the vehicle based on a monthly budget.  This is an essential tool to keep you under your budget when negotiating your next car purchase.  * User inputs desired monthly payments along with the sales tax, down payment, trade-in, finance term, interest rate and any other fees.* The app calculates and displays the purchase price of the vehicle both before and after tax as well as the total cost of the vehicle including interest.  **NOTE: For both tools, the user has the option of choosing whether or not sales tax is applied to dealer fees and/or trade-ins.**This app calculates payments on 0% interest and gracefully handles erroneous input values.",
