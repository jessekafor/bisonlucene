Designed for use nationwide, YourGOV helps prompt quicker responses to requests and issues and keeps local governments mindful of the things that affect your life every day.  By connecting citizens and government together, YourGOV opens new lines of communication, providing the access and transparency that helps us build smarter, more sustainable, and more collaborative communities.  Quick and Easy* Simply identify the location, fill in your details, and submit. Once submitted, YourGOV will automatically deliver your request to the appropriate participating organization.Google Map* Google Maps provides a familiar, user-friendly environment. Use your current location; search for a location; perform a Long Press to drop a pin; or simply hold and drag the pin to the issue's location when submitting a request. Community Aware* YourGOV automatically determines which local government should receive your request, giving you an active community role wherever you go. The request is automatically entered into the organization's Work and Asset Management System - Cartegraph. This also allows participating communities to specify which issues they can address, and which issues can be reported via your smartphone.YourGOV â A Citizen Request Application that connects you to your government.",
