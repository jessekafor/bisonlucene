        "comment": "This app works perfectly! People that are complaining about it just do not know how to use it right the app has to be installed on both phones it has to be running. But if you want to install it on someone phone and have it running without them knowing you can still do that if you can manage to get their phone happy do everything it told you to do to be able to track someone and just leave the app in the background running it should never come up. Very accurate with location",
