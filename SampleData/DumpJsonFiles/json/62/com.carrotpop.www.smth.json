    "description": "S.M.T.H. (Send Me To Heaven) is a sport game. Player throws his phone as high as he can. The higher, the better. The phone registers the height and uploads result to leader boards. World Top 10, Week Top 10 and Day Top 10 lists are available. SAFETY FIRST: Be careful not to injure yourself or others. Be always aware that there is enough space above you and around you. WARNING: Throwing a smartphone high into the air may result in both damage to the smartphone, property and/or personal injury. Author and distributor of S.M.T.H. is not liable for any damages or injuries arising out of playing the S.M.T.H. game.HINTS: Avoid rotations in the air. Rotating phones can give wrong results. Every phone is different, so it needs a different treatment. Start to throw your phone gently about 20 cm, find the way which works for you and increase the height gradually. Developing skills is the part of the game!NOTE: Game works only on ARMv7 phones.Q&A:Q: I keep getting result 0 meters even if I toss my phone high. Why?A: Evey type of phone behaves differently as sensors are differently implemented. In most cases the problem is caused by rotations in air, which generate G-force. Throwing phone without rotations can help. Other common problem is that people shake phone before throwing and 0 is actually generated even before the phone flies. Solution is to throw phone gently, slowly, avoid rotations. Start with low height (around 20 cm), increase the height gradually. learn proper skills. Master your tool. Become champion!Q: I want to change my nickname. How?A: Uninstall S.M.T.H. App and install it again. You will be asked to pick your name again. Q: How can somebody throw the phone over 40 meters?A: I received some photographs. I don't want to pubish them as I wouldn't recommend to anyone to try that. It's not a safe practice. Q: I still keep getting 0 meters result. What's wrong?A: It's your technique or bad sensors in your phone. Try following: Be sure that S.M.T.H. is the only App running on your phone. Place your phone on your palm, screen up. SLOWLY move your hand down. STOP for a moment. SMOOTHLY throw your phone up in air about 50 cm from your hand, avoiding any rotation. let it land on your palm, screen still UP. Still 0 meters? Try another phone, sorry. Q: I am getting the same result again and again, it's below 1 meter. A: Try following: Be sure that S.M.T.H. is the only App running on your phone. Place your phone on your palm, screen up. SLOWLY move your hand down. STOP for a moment. SMOOTHLY throw your phone up in air about 50 cm from your hand, avoiding any rotation. let it land on your palm, screen still UP. Still the same result? Try another phone, sorry. Post photos and videos of your attempts: https://www.facebook.com/S.M.T.H.gameCopyright Â© 2012 - 2013 Petr Svarovsky",
