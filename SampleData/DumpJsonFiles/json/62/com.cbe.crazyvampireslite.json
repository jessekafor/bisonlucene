    "description": "Crazy Vampires is an offbeat action puzzle game, filled with vampires, traps, crazy Transylvanian music and fun.Itâs almost dawn and vampires are returning into their coffins for a well-deserved sleep after a long night. Time is ticking until the dawn and theyâve discovered that a bunch of vampire slayers got there first and set up traps! Now itâs up to you to use your supernatural powers of tile rotation, garlic-based repellent and spider net slow-down, to help them overcome all obstacles and reach their regular daily rest.How the game plays?Your main objective is to save vampires by leading them safely through the labyrinth and into their crypts. To do so, you can rotate the labyrinth parts to create new paths or use garlic-based repellent and spider-net slowdown to prevent vampires from walking into peril. Many traps are indeed lurking for the poor vampires. Starting with simple ones like pure light, things get more complicated down the road. Mobile wooden stakes, silver gun bullets, hired assassins or crazy garlic sappers wait impatiently to vaporize your vampires once for all.Do you think youâve mastered the game already? Wait! Thereâs more. Each level can be completed with additional objectives to earn emerald or even gold status. And rest assured that the gold status will not be easy.Features:- 8 levels- Medal awards- Achievements- Traps",
