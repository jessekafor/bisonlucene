    "description": "The mobile companion to the Charms Office Assistant for Parents/Student/Members! Includes the recording studio to record alone, to play along and record with accompaniments, and to complete assignments. Also includes the Charms Parent/Student/Member Mobile Portal, with the calendar, financial statement, practice logs, teacher contacts, links to handouts and files, password change and a place to update personal information.NOTE: If you have any technical problems with the APP, please don't post them here, contact our office at 214-556-1912 and we will try to help you. Your problem might be unique to YOUR situation and we can probably help you. Or you can email our support team at charmssupport@charmsmusic.comFAQ: HEADPHONES:  The Android version of the app is not intended to be used with headphones if you want to merge your recording with the accompaniment track.SLEEPING: iOS puts the app in the background when sleeping. The user can set their device sleep/timeout to whatever they want to avoid sleeping while recording.MULTIPLE RECORDINGS: If you are recording several recordings in a row, you need to touch the \"trash\" icon to clear out any existing tracks or recordings in the memory of the app before starting a new one.MULTIPLE STUDENTS: If you are using one device to record multiple students, be sure to completely sign the other student out by \"killing\" the app in the task bar of your device before logging in the other student. The APP will keep the student in memory until you do this. Also be sure to click the \"trash\" button before starting a new student recording.LENGTH OF RECORDING: There is a 20MB limit on files that can be uploaded to the cloud, but that's a very large file. Depending on the memory of your device and the speed of your network connection, your results may vary.NUMBER OF RECORDINGS: There is no limit to the number of recordings a student may upload. But each recording name must be unique.",
