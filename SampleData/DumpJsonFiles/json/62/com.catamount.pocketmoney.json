In iOS version, you have ability to reconciled but not on Android. Reconciliation is a major feature in any expenses tracking too. You need this feature to easy balanced against the monthly statement. Without it, balancing becomes a real pain. Not sure why Android version lack this critical feature?

        "comment": "Crashes constantly. Today it crashed and when I got it going many transactions had been doubled up and trebled and some appear four times. Ios version was great. The android version is terrible. God knows how I am going to sort out the mess of my accounts it has left UPDATE. I reinstalled and now my phone and tablet won\\'t sync the info, won\\'t even start to and the phone app just crashes. Absolute crap. Going to find an alternative that works",

        "comment": "This app is horrible on android. Cant do anything on it. Waste of 5.00 and may go back to iphone. Emailed support so we will see what they do if anything.   \\342\\230\\205\\342\\230\\205 support is of no help and no refund since it has been 6 hours. (Took hours to get response )   Do not buy this app!   ** anMoney is 9.99 but works correctly AND has reconciliation. Also provides money back guarantee if not satisified in the first WEEK. (NOT 15 MINUTES)",
