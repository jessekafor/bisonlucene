The domestic cat is a small, usually furry, carnivorous mammal. It is valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests.The ancient Egyptians had the first pet of this kind. These animals were brought to Europe, Asia and North America during settlement periods. Modern cats have many characteristics of their ancestors, such as body shape, feeding habits and predatory instincts. There are more than 100 recognized breeds worldwide, with the Siamese cat as the most popular. Each breed has specific characteristics and stereotypical personalities.Depending on your perspective, these cute animals have many endearing or annoying behavior traits. Some of the more adorable behaviors include purring, constant grooming, kneading, curiosity, playfulness and vocalization. Their normal behaviors that can wreak havoc on a home include scratching and biting. They have many non-verbal expressions, and you can usually tell a cat's mood by observing his ear positions and tail movements.",
