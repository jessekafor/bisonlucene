Just focused the camera completely on a \\\"hotspot\\\" for a couple seconds till Chuck e appeared, then slowly backed out to get my daughter in the pic.    The animation of the mouse made it a little challenging to take a good pic, but I did get a couple decent ones from throughout the restaurant.  4 stars because the app wouldn\\'t close on its own. Had to kill it every time.",
