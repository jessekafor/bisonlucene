All speakers and talk content are 100% faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Download the app for free and sample some of the talks. Upgrade to the full version to have unlimited access to the complete library of talks.These MP3's are streamed to your Android device, not downloaded, so they take up no storage space.  A connection is required for the MP3 to play properly.If you have already purchased the full library on another Android device, you can unlock it again by downloading the free version, selecting the \"Upgrade\" button, and going through the purchase process again. You will not be charged again. HAVING PROBLEMS?** Try uninstalling and reinstall the free app, then upgrade again. Any time you reinstall an app you purchased,you have to go through the upgrade process again.  You will not actually be charged again **** New device? Same as the above directions for reinstalling. **** Google Plays won't let you reinstall saying \"you already own it\"?  This is a bug they are working on but have not fixed yet.  We have a work around in the meantime.  Please email us at catholicvault@gmail.com to request instructions. **Associated Themes for Catholics:  Prayer, Philosophy, Theology, Christian Apologetics, Evangelization.",

Now after the ICS update on my Razr I emailed 10 & 20 days ago about an app and nobody responded. The content is very good but if you upgrade and need help support seems to be gone.",
