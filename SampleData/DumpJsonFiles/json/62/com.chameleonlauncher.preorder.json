This launcher is far worse than even the stock ones I tried: very poor customization choices, few native widgets (sure everybody can make his own but we\\'re not all programmers), native android widgets disappear randomly, no chance to make folders or change icons, furthermore it takes AGES to load at boot time and when I close any app. This launcher is like a politician: it promised lots of nice stuff, got all our money, and now it\\'s realizing 1/10 of what was promised. Very very poor.",

I have my screens divided into a news page, a twitter page etc. So rather than the phone launchers which are to look at, this is for function and usefulness. Since it works for me so well, I tend not to think of it as an extra app, but a integral part of my tablet. Boredom, schmoredom.  This thing is great.",

        "comment": "The UI is very diffrent from what you are used to in Android, it takes a while to get used to. I forced myself to use Chameleon as my daily lanucher for a couple of weeks and I liked it more and more. There are however to major issues: 1. The widgets are loading quite slow after wakeup which is really annoying and 2. The lack of widgets. The ability to use \\\"ordinary\\\" widgets helps, but chamelon really needs more of it\\'s own beautiful widgets. If you think the UI and layout looks interesting I can definitly recommend you buying this launcher. Give it a wholehearty try and I think you\\'ll love it. And hopefully it will get better over time.",

        "comment": "I was excited for Chameleon.  I pre-ordered it.  It was a waste of $10, definitely.  I\\'m running it on an Asus Transformer TF101 (original), so maybe the terrible performance is partly my fault, but Chameleon is slow, takes forever to boot-up, crashes, refuses to properly switch between profiles (defeating half of it\\'s functionality) and ultimately just doesn\\'t realize its vision of a better tablet interface.    Make-a-widget seemed like an answer to some of this, but developer interest seems to have completely fallen off.  Nobody is making anything or updating their old widgets.  Back to ADW after on-and-off attempts to make this work for me.  Not worth the frustration, even for the money I sunk in.  Hope it gets better.",
