        "comment": "Waiting for 2nd quarter to be released. Its an awesome app but  needs better functionality. Like ability to increase/decrease font size. Highlight and copy text for later referencing. At this stage just looks like a pdf, could be better if it was a fully functional app. But great none the less. Keep it up!!",
