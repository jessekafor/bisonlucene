Wallpaper adding is unnecessarily  complicated.  It has promise, but the bugs and speed will drive anyone away. I can\\'t recommend this until those issues are sorted.",

It would be better if you could set your own wallpaper though, instead of just having the default ones.  Edit: I also tested it out on my Nexus 4 and liked it as well. The more I use it the more I like it. There is room for improvement though. Just one example is that when you switch from landscape to portrait mode (or vise versa) the widgets don\\'t flip the way one would expect. Keep up the good work though.",
