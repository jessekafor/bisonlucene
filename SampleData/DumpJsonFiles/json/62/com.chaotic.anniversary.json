    "description": "My girlfriend is 100% pure liquid awesomeness in a beautiful veil :DUnfortunately, I'm not around her at the moment, and it's our 5th anniversary today, so I've made this little application for her last night as a small token of my appreciation for being with me for all this time :)Yeah, it's kinda private, too, so I'd appreciate if you wouldn't download this particular application (it's also somewhat buggy). Other cool stuff is on the way though :)But meanwhile, once again, Tanya, you're the best baby ;D Gratz :*",
