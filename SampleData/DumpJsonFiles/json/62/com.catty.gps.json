    "description": "Many useful GPS functions on a single user-friendly scrollable screen:* GPS status, coordinates, direction, speed* Pedometer / Odometer / Aerobic-ometer* Link to map apps. Share location by texting/email/etc.* Sound alerts for speed, milestones, signal loss, fitness* Chart trails automatically, add landmarks (where's my car?)* Magnetic compass, GPS heading/bearing* GPS and other settings, to conserve battery or increase accuracy* Bright and dark color schemes for outdoor legibility* Optional help info in each section* Absolutely NO invasion of privacy, ads, spyware, etc.Designed especially for walkers / hikers / joggers,keeps track of time / distance / speed over an irregular course.Gives visibility and control of finicky GPS parameters.Various audio tones monitor status and progress.A bread-crumbs chart helps find your way back.After initialization, the screen is usually off to conserve batteryWhen turned on, all info is easy to find and view while walking,with quick access to a map (Catty Map, Google's, etc)and location sharing. HOME key allows use of other appswhile this one continues running in the background.More notes and details:Before starting a hike it is wise to: Start the GPS and let it stabilize(find satellites and current location). Adjust the text size for legibility.Also, run a map app and pre-load the area, marking planned waypointsto stay on-track; there is often poor network reception on trails.At the trailhead, CLEAR the first lap info (as described below).Audio beeps alert the user if the GPS signal is weak; user canswitch the phone to a different pocket or look for an open spotto stop and get a better fix. GPS works best with a clear viewof the horizons; bodies and trees block the signal.Each GPS device varies in characteristics, as seen in the 2ndpanel (orange) while immobile and listening to the beep codes.During GPS location updates (every N seconds) status goes BUSY,then a beep sound indicates:DOUBLE-beep at the start of a new lap;CLICK for no-change or data out-of-range;HIGH/LOW beep for over/under speed threshold;TRIPLE-beep for passing a milestone.SPEED and HEADING are shown in panel 3 (yellow)based on just the last 2 fixes, not very precise whenthe time and distance between them is small.The GPS-estimated accuracy of its own fixes variesand is visibly inaccurate especially about altitude.After experimentation you can set minimum satellitesand best believable accuracy. This reduces inaccuracyin the cumulative data (last panel, blue).Outdoors in a flat open area, most mobile units are accurateto within 10 meters; in canyons or downtowns, much worse.Indoors it may be impossible to get any decent fix.App ignores really-bad fixes (as defined above).Cumulative info is shown in the last (blue) panel.The current lap can be CLEARed (discarded)or SUMmed into the TOTAL column. Assumingno large gaps in GPS reception, accuracy andaverages here are quite good. ... We recommend30+ fitness points per week for better health.",
