And the most annoying thing is that if you swipe in the direction of an app but instead of stopping at the app icon you go a bit further in that direction so it won\\'t unlock or launch that app. I mean it should recognise the directional gesture regardless of weather you stop at app icon or not.  And second thing many times quick unlocking and locking causes direct entry without it showing up.",
