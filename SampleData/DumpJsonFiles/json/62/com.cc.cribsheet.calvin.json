        "comment": "The news feed section is great. As an alumnus who never actively searched for Calvin updates, it keeps me in touch with things that I wouldn\\'t hear about otherwise.   The only issue I\\'ve noticed is the share via email link seems to be broken. It takes me to my Gmail inbox, but doesn\\'t open a new email with the article I want to share. The feedback email link does the same thing, so I was unable to alert the developers directly.",
