Dreams can diagnose the causes of our physical ailments, point out the thoughts and emotions that weâve tried to overlook, and often make suggestions for improving our relationships with others. While dreaming, we can gain awareness about our entire being: physically, mentally, and spiritually.Although it is true that many of us do not consciously remember all of our dreams, everyone dreams. During the early part of this century, while psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were demonstrating the clinical importance of dreams, Edgar Cayce was providing average individuals with guidelines for working with what has become one of the most practical approaches to dreams. Hundreds of Cayceâs psychic readings deal with the subject of dreams and dream interpretation. Perhaps the most important insights gained from the wealth of his material is the fact that each of us is aware of much more â about ourselves, our physical bodies, our surroundings, even our lifestyles â at subconscious levels than we realize when we are awake.We hope youâll find this to be a useful tool for living and dreaming!",
