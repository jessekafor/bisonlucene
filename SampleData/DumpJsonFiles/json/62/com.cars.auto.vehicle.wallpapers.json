Automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. As of 2002, there were 590 million passenger cars worldwide (roughly one per eleven people). Around the world, there were about 806 million automobiles and light trucks on the road in 2007; they burn over 260 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China and India. A luxury vehicle was once fairly easy to define. Compared to the average ho-hum vehicle on the market, the luxury automobiles generally offered far better performance on the road and a far fancier and more comfortable interior. It also came with a far more expensive price tag.Over the years, automakers have discovered that many consumers like and will pay good money for luxury touches, even when it comes to vehicles that seem to be the polar opposites of staid, classically from Mercedes or Audi.Last year, Hyundai, once considered a âcheapâ brand in every sense of the word, basically stopped selling the bare-bones version of its lowest-price model, the Accent. It said that because the vast majority of drivers didnât want the base model priced below $13,000, the cheapest MSRP for the Accent essential topped $14,000. According to USA Today, the 2013 Accent will start at over $15K and include several features that used to be options as standard, such as a USB port, heated side mirrors, and remoteless key entry.The Car Wallpapers provide you with the best collection of luxury and powerful vehicles.  Download it and enjoy!",
