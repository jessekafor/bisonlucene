With the app being titled trip planner I would have thought that would be a way 2 navigate from point A to B and have it help you get there the fastest easiest most direct way.  Nope.  Guess it isn\\'t bad if you just want to check travel delays and look at it highway cameras but you can do that on Google too so I\\'ll stick with that.",
