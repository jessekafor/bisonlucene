    "description": "Caynax HIIT - High-intensity interval trainingHave You ever wanted to burn body fat and get perfect abs?Try interval workout to burn belly fat and then Caynax Aerobic Weider Six (A6W) app to form perfect 6 pack.High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training, is an enhanced form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating periods of short intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 9â20 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition, improved glucose metabolism, and improved fat burning.HIIT session consists of a warm up period of exercise, followed by six to ten repetitions of high intensity exercise, separated by medium intensity exercise, and ending with a period of cool down exercise. The high intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise. The goal is to do at least six cycles, and to have the entire HIIT session last at least fifteen minutes and not more than twenty.There is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on your level cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking.The original protocol set a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30â40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15â20 seconds of jogging or walking.HIIT is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited on time.Because of exercise intensity this type of workout is not intended for everyone.

Wish I could raise and lower the volume of the speech and beeps in app. It\\'s too loud over online radio and turning down the master volume on the phone makes my music too soft. I manually lowered the dB of the audio files using sound forge. Kind of a pain :(",

I made a suggestion via email, the developer responded immediately and actually uploaded a new version within 1 day or so, with my suggestion included. For just 0.50\\342\\202\\254 ? Impressive.   Full 5 stars.  I highly recommend the pro version to support Caynax and developers like him.",
