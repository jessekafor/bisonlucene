The game is incredibly fun as you fly around trying to gather as much weaponry as possible while avoiding the fire from your opponents. There are 7 different planes to choose from including a totally cool balsa airplane with a rubber-band powered propeller. There are 7 different Multiplayer Battle Levels plus a single-player Training Level. - Online Multiplayer Battles.- PlayPhone Integrated- Facebook Integration",
