    "description": "\"Quatomic Puzzle\" is a fun and challenging puzzle game with high quality graphics and touch screen optimized controls. It has 99 levels with nice graphics and full sound.  One âorbâ at a time is released at the top of the screen. You need to manipulate the carousels and get 4 orbs of the same color together, causing that particular carousel to explode.  You advance to the next level by causing all of the carousels to explode.How to Play:Rotate the carousel by tapping the center of the carousel.  Move the orbs from one carousel to another by swiping them with your finger.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
