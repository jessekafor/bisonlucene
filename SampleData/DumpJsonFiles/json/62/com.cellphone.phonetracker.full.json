Quickly I began to not trust what the app was telling me, although sometimes it was right. I actually think the \\\"Lite\\\" version worked better than the paid version. I was doing ok with the Lite version and upgraded. Wish I hadn\\'t.",

Don\\'t bother writing to the app designer. You get no reply. If you want a refund, you only have 15 minutes to get it. Pretty slick scam cause it takes that long to install and try it out just to did out it\\'s CRAP!!!!!!!!",
