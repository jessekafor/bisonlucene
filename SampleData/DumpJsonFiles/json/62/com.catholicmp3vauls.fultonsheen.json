    "description": "Almost 300 audio talks from the great 20th Century Catholic preacher and writer, Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen.  Includes many of his retreat talks to priests and laymen, his St. Therese of Lisieux series, and his incredible 50-part catechism series that outlines all the basic teachings of the Catholic Church, as well as many individual talks on so many important topics relevant today.  Grow in your own spiritual life and get to know the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from the man loved and admired by people of all Christian and non-Christian religions for his commanding and sincere preaching via radio and television.  He died in 1979, and he is in the process of becoming a canonized saint of the Catholic Church.  This is an amazing collection you don't want to be without.Download the app for free and sample talks in each category listing. Upgrade to the full version to have unlimited access to the complete library of talks. These MP3's are streamed to your Android device, not downloaded, so they take up no storage space.  A connection is required for the MP3 to play properly.If you have already purchased the full library on another Android device, you can unlock it again by downloading the free version, selecting the \"Upgrade\" button, and going through the purchase process again. You will not be charged again. HAVING PROBLEMS?** Try uninstalling and reinstall the free app, then upgrade again. Any time you reinstall an app you purchased,you have to go through the upgrade process again.  You will not actually be charged again **** New device? Same as the above directions for reinstalling. **** Google Plays won't let you reinstall saying \"you already own it\"?  This is a bug they are working on but have not fixed yet.  We have a work around in the meantime.  Please email us at catholicvault@gmail.com to request instructions. **Other themes for Catholics:  Catechism, Theology, Philosophy, Saints, Priesthood.",
