    "description": "Have you ever wanted to unlock a door... Movie Style?This application is a simple toy that recreates a movie clichÃ©: the all-purpose electronic door opening tool. Note: This application cannot actually unlock a door. It is for entertainment purposes only.PRO TIP: the unlock sequence runs faster if you press start twice or more in the same decode.When rating the app 5 stars ;) please answer this question: what other movie clichÃ©s would you like to see recreated?",
