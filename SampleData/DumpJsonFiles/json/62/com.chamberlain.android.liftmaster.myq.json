I can see one eighth of the door and the rest is off the screen. I can still open and close it. But that bug needs to be fixed. You should be able to scroll left and right. The second bug is when I go to another area of the program like settings I cant use the back button on my note 2 to go back a screen. It logs me out and I have to reopen the program and log in again. 5 stars when fixed.",

I would like to see a widget or a shortcut so that I can add a device to my home screen and just tap to open without having to go through the app.  Tasker/NFC integration would bring this up to 5 stars!!!",
