    "description": "-= WE FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH USERS THAT OUR HOST IS RESPONDING A LITTLE SLOWER THAN USUAL. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING A TRANSITION TO A BETTER PACKAGE WHILE MAINTAINING A FREE PRODUCT =-  :D THANKS everyone for your help. Thank you Richard Watson for alerting us to the latency!This Tarot game has been a somewhat long but very rewarding journey. We have spent days at a time; pouring over the old works of Alchemy, Quabbalah, Ceremonial Magick, ancient Hebrew, Sumerian, Babylonian, Gnostic/Christian, and much more. We have established a Database and API to rival the holdings of Dr. Hall. We have searched the depths of Jung, Crowley, Waite, Blatvatsky, Cooper, Mathers, and many more.We hope our game amuses and puzzles you. We have given our best to make sure small things like the double zodiac of the Thoth deck, and the ramblings of a Madman that Tzaddi is, indeed, not The Star have been accounted for. We offer the uncorrected waite deck, three and celtic cross spreads for free. We will soon launch the Thoth deck, and Golden Dawn spread when we have finished the coding for the dignities of the triplets in the GD spread.-= We are currently working on the release of the Thoth/Crowley Deck, the Golden Dawn Spread, and the Necromancers table background for in-app purchase =-",
