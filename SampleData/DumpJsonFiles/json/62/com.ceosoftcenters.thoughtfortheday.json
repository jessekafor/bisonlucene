For more than 40 years of his adult life, Cayce gave psychic âreadingsâ to thousands of seekers while in an unconscious state, diagnosing illnesses and revealing lives lived in the past and prophecies yet to come. In a state of relaxation and meditation, he was able to place his mind in contact with all time and spaceâthe universal consciousnessâalso known as the super-conscious mind. From there, he could respond to questions as broad as, âWhat are the secrets of the universe?â to âWhat is my purpose in life?â His responses to these questions came to be called âreadings,â and their insights offer practical help and advice to individuals even today.We hope youâll find this to be a useful tool for living an inspired life!",
