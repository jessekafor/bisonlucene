    "description": "Train your dog to do tricks!Train your dog to stop barking!or if there is a dog next door, use this app to make it silent.Features-Variable frequency tone generator-Bark detector-Sound level meterHow does it work?Dogs are capable of hearing sounds at much higher frequencies than people. A dog whistle works by emitting a high frequency tone in a range that a dog does not ordinarily encounter â typically between 14,000 Hz and 20,000 Hz. The highest frequency a normal middle aged human can hear is 12,000-14,000 Hz, so donât be alarmed if you canât hear the dog whistle yourself. These high frequency tones have the effect of immediately getting a dogâs attention. Dog whistles are typically used as part of a training routine designed to train your dog to do tricks or for behavior modification. A pure tone is much easier for a dog to distinguish compared to verbal commands. Different sound patterns can be used to trigger different responses. For example, two short bursts could mean stop and one long burst could mean lie down. The bark detector feature of this application triggers a tone when the sound level exceeds a threshold. This feature, in addition to training, can be used to help you train your dog to stop barking. Dog whistles are great training tools and has been used successfully with all breeds.",
