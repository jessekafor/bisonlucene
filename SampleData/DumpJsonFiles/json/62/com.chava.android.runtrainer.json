        "comment": "This app is excellent and does what it says. Dont expect heavy duty features from it but thats what this app is best at. Its simple!! I use it everytime I go jogging. However I\\'m facing one very annoying issue. I live in India and we use kilometers as the standard distance unit. But this app always defaults to Miles everytime I start it. But it appears to be saving my preference. When I go to the settings and select default unit I see Kilometers selected but even then the app only measures in Miles. I have to select miles and then select kilometers back for the app to change only to show miles again the next time I open it. This becomes very annoying.",
