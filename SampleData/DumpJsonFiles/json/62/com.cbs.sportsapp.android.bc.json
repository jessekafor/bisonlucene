        "comment": "No audio, and video may or may not stream. If it freezes and you try to start it up again, you will be forced back to some earlier portion of the game that you have already seen. So I was still cycling through the last 5 minutes of period one, which I had, in the end, seen 5 times, while the game was, in real time, already in period in 3. This should be easy to fix, but it doesn\\'t look like they care to.",
