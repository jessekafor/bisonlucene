If you have any data on your phone that you don't want anybody to see, even your families and close friends, Secret App Lock is the app you need.  SMS, emails, photos, phonebooks, personal setting, SNS, just protect any apps you want.  Lock them with not only passowrds and patterns but also with multiple ways such as gesture, location(GPS), incoming call from specific numbers, and more.  In case single lock is not enough, you can set two or more locks on more important apps.[Support] OS 2.1 overXperia arc, MEDIAS, Optimus, GALAPAGOS, HTC EVO, IS05REGZA, LYNX 3D, Galaxy Tab, Galaxy S, LYNX, Xperia(2.1update), HTC Desire Libero, AQUOS, SIRIUSÎ± IS06, Nexus S, Nexus One, Motorola XOOM, etc.[tag]app lock, app protector, applocker, password, privacy, application protection, lock, smart lock, protect, protector, guard, secure, protection, seal app, app manager, application lock, cgene",
