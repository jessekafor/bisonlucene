Upgrade to the full version to have unlimited access to the complete library of talks. These MP3's are streamed to your Android device, not downloaded, so they take up no storage space.  A connection is required for the MP3 to play properly.If you have already purchased the full library on another Android device, you can unlock it again by downloading the free version, selecting the \"Upgrade\" button, and going through the purchase process again. You will not be charged again. HAVING PROBLEMS?** Try uninstalling and reinstall the free app, then upgrade again. Any time you reinstall an app you purchased,you have to go through the upgrade process again.  You will not actually be charged again **** New device? Same as the above directions for reinstalling. **** Google Plays won't let you reinstall saying \"you already own it\"?  This is a bug they are working on but have not fixed yet.  We have a work around in the meantime.

        "comment": "Good potential, but apps like this should not be allowed on the market before proper testing.I would love to be supportive,but after paying for the upgrade (twice) for this, catholic history, etc - all apps hang, crash or just do not work.Forces one to buy it again, which is fine, but still crashes with no refund option. Content may be great, but is of no use if it doesn\\'t work. Intentional or unintentionally it\\'s not professional to put out a non-functional product.I hope and pray it is fixed soon.",
