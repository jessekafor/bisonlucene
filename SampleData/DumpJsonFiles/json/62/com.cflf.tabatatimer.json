    "description": "Ready to try Tabata Training?  Tabata Timer takes the guesswork out of timing your intervals and remembering the order of your exercises.  As a Certified Fitness Trainer, I know the importance of accurately timing workouts and transitioning smoothly from one exercise to the next.Configure 1 to 4 exercises for 1 to 8 sets.  The exercise interval and rest interval can each be set for 10 to 60 seconds in 10-second increments.  You supply the name of each exercise to be performed.The timer screen displays the exercise name or Rest until the final three seconds of the interval.  It then displays Next: (exercise name or Rest).  A warning tone plays during these final seconds to signal the start of the next interval.  The exercise number and set number are also displayed so you always know where you are in your workout.  The screen will not sleep while the timer is running.  Both portrait and landscape views are supported.Use the volume control on your device to set it to your needs.  A pause and resume button allows you to take extra breaks or extend rest periods if needed.Download Tabata Timer today and start enjoying the benefits of workouts that you design specifically for yourself!  If you like this app, try Tabata Timer Pro for only $1.99.  It allows you to save and retrieve your workouts so you don't have to re-enter them every time.",
