    "description": "Chanakya (About this sound pronunciation (helpÂ·info); c. 370â283 BCE) was an Indian teacher, philosopher and royal advisor.Originally a professor of economics and political science at the ancient Takshashila University, Chanakya managed the first Maurya emperor Chandragupta's rise to power at a young age. He is widely credited for having played an important role in the establishment of the Maurya Empire, which was the first empire in archaeologically recorded history to rule most of the Indian subcontinent. Chanakya served as the chief advisor to both Chandragupta and his son Bindusara.Chanakya is traditionally identified as Kautilya or Vishnu Gupta, who authored the ancient Indian political treatise called Arthasastra (Economics).As such, he is considered as the pioneer of the field of economics and political science in India, and his work is thought of as an important precursor to classical economics.His works were lost near the end of the Gupta dynasty and not rediscovered until 1915",
