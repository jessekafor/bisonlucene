        "comment": "Noooooooo!!!! What an excellent text editor! Nearly perfect! Very clean layout. No annoying tool bars. Good font face/size options. Even background color is configurable. Remembers last opened file and... opens it automatically on next launch! And on the very same line as before!!! Saves and exports. Saves with different name if desired. Attaches to email. Remembers recent files. Absolutely and awesomely excellent except... it doesn\\'t support encoding! Many characters in my ISO-8859-1 files (all of them) are truncated. The app is useless to me! Tragedy!",
