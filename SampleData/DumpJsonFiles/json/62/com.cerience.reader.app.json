So since all of my pdfs came from my Mac, there\\'s a duplicate that begins with a period. Thus I have to scroll through all of these duplicates before getting to the real files. Fix those two and it\\'s a definite 5 stars! (A zoom slider would be nice too, so that you can zoom with the stylus only. And being able to scroll vertically continuous would be nice too.)  Edit: one more thing: I wish the vertical scrolling was continuous. I hate having to do a big swipe just to change pages.",

The only small complaint I have is that you can only view one page at a time (in other words, when scrolling from page to page, you can\\'t have part of both pages showing on screen simultaneously). But this is really a very minor annoyance.  EDIT: A recent development is that on my TF700 the screen sort of wobbles back and forth briefly. This sometimes happens quite frequently (every few seconds). Often I can get it to stop by stopping and restarting the app. This only happens in Repligo and not in any other apps (even other apps for viewing PDFs).",

        "comment": "I have had repligo pdf reader for several months. Recently, a friend urged me to try ezPDF and I can\\'t tell you how underwhelmed I was by the experience.  ezPDF\\'s only advantage is a more beautiful graphical effect when you turn the page--it looks like an Android e-book with a paper-book like effect.  But if you are doing annotations on a pdf file, trying to highlight or underline sections, repligo is so much better I couldn\\'t believe it.  In ezPDf, it is literally impossible to mark and adjust the text you want to grab unless you have a stylus. On the other hand, repligo has the Android style range markers that are easy to adjust.   So, even though I bought ezPDF, I\\'m back to repligo.  And if they\\'d distribute a version for Linux operating systems, I\\'d buy that too.   pj",
