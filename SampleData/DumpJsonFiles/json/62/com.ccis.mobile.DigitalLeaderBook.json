    "description": "The Leader's e-Book application is intended to help both the individual Soldier and the unit leader manage the data that is typically kept in a physical (green) leaderâs notebook. It provides you, as the leader, instant access to the most frequently used information about your Soldiers. It will also allow you, as an individual Soldier, to track your own personal information. This application leverages the capabilities of your phone such as camera, GPS, real-time mapping and directions, as well as the phone itself. Some of the information you can store and keep at your fingertips (with additional items added in future releases) includes:â¢\tContact informationâ¢\tNames and birth dates of children and spousesâ¢\tAnniversary datesâ¢\tScores and dates of various types of qualifications and tests (such as weapons and physical fitness)â¢\tLinks to various online reference publications and military awardsâ¢\tSample checklists and report formatsâ¢\tRisk management assessmentâ¢\tDaily Personnel Status Reportsâ¢\tYour military awardsâ¢\tSizes for various uniform items and equipmentWe hope you can use this application to help you better manage your personal career and, as a leader, become more effective by allowing you to focus more on caring for, and leading, your Soldiers and less on having to update hard-copy information.Thanks to everyone for your great feedback and suggestions!",

Needs to be able to auto fill forms (automatically put the Soldiers name in a counseling form).  Be able to print data and send it either by email and or text.  Also you should be able to import files such as a Soldiers ERB and last NCOER, PT and weapons cards.  Right now this app is more of a quick reference you still need the paper copy of your leadersbook to have all information needed.",

I also think the option when you pull up a form, being able to select a SM\\'s name (drop down box option) on that form I.e. DA Form 4856, then that SM\\'s information is pre-loaded in that form would be pretty cool.  That would be a huge time saver and allow us as Leaders to focus more on training Soldiers.",
