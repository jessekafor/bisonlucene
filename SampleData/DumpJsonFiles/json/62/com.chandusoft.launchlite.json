You only see a very small window on which you have to scroll through all your apps and there is no option to hide the apps which have already been categorized",

        "comment": "7/6/13 - When attempting to select a tab in the SubTab bar, if is often UNRESPONSIVE.  Also, the SubTab bar is WAY TOO NARROW, so that swiping must be precise.  Additionally, the SubTab bar is often UNRESPONSIVE which means having to swipe over and over to get it to respond.  This not only makes accessing apps FRUSTRATING but, when coupled with the narrowness of the SubTab bar, can result in ACCIDENTALLY OPENING APPS which are just under this bar. ---- Another TIME-CONSUMING, eyeball-straining thing - when you go to select apps to assign to a tab, the list of apps is NOT ALPHABETICAL!  So you have to slowly go through your entire list of apps to find the one (or ones) you wish to assign.  Egads! ---- If that wasn\\'t enough, when I tried to change the name of tabs, it often wouldn\\'t do it and then would consistently CRASH! ---- Because of the above, I concluded that THIS APP IS MORE TROUBLE THAN IT IS WORTH.  I had set up many sub-tabs before I discovered these problems and, therefore, WASTED A LOT OF TIME.  My suggestion to others:  Try it out to see if you have the same problems BEFORE spending much time with this app.",

        "comment": "At first, it sounds like a great idea.  After installing, it takes lot of effort to sort your apps into the categories. OK it is a one-off investment.  Then every time an app is updated, it is thrown back to the first tab (Tools - Default) unless you stop it in time (which is next to impossible because it is happening when I am not watching the phone).  Since it is not integrated with the launcher or buttons, when you want to run anything, you won\\'t want to launch app man first and then launch your app. It is only useful when you think you have an app and can\\'t find it. Even in that situation, you had better use the google search.  So after putting in lots of effort (one off and on going), I still haven\\'t yet find a single situation I want to use it.",
