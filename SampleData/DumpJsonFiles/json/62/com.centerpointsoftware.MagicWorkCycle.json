    "description": "The Magic Work Cycle is a powerful productivity technique. It's also very simple. Work for thirty minutes, giving all of your attention to whatever project you are working on. After thirty minutes, take a break for thirty minutes. You can do anything you want to take your mind off of your work. Then repeat again with thirty minutes of work. Be amazed at your increase in productivity! Then experiment with different work and play times to find what best suits you.(This free application is inspired by Chetan Surpur's 30/30 Minute Work Cycle life hack and magicworkcycle.com.)",
