        "comment": "This is a great voice. It can be a little choppy at points but in general it sounds good. Cereproc has great customer service. The voice stopped working with the latest Google Maps Navigation update. I emailed the developer and within hours I had a response and there was and update to the voice in the play store.",

        "title": "Good sound - needs rate control",
        "comment": "The app runs great and the voice sounds good and is easy to understand.   However the default speeds of normal and slow end up with the voice speaking like its rushed, or slow and choppy. I was able to get the voice to sound perfect using the rate control in the application itself (where u can test it and adjust rate/pitch).  There needs to be a way to make that rate and pitch control actually set the speed and tone of the voice. If that is how your supposed to set it, it doesn\\'t work on my phone.",
