        "comment": "Bought this app because it does not request any special permissions like other free compass (e.g. some need phone access! - do not install them!). It can use the declination from the GPS or you can set it manually, and you can set a few targets to point to. Still a few improvements I would like:  - The labels E/S/W/N etc. are a little hard to find/read since they are in small letters and in the same colour as the whole bearing. A different colour (white labels in the holo dark blue theme would do it).  - The GPS accuracy is shown in feet. Would be nice to see this value in meters. Nothing else I would change.",

        "comment": "I was actually looking for a qibla compass but saw this and thought why not.     Surprisingly effective.     I\\'ve often been frustrated by traditional magnetic compasses where interference (whether electrical or material) results in glaringly wrong readings.     The roll and pitch feature means that it could even double suggests that it may double up as a simple spirit level.     One addition i would welcome would be to be able to type in a bearing to provide a guidleline to align to.",
