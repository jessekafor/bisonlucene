        "comment": "I bought the pro licence to show support for the dev. The description says that if you buy the pro there won\\'t be any ads. But I often see ads, and the app menu still shows purchase pro! So the licence is often not recognized by the app. I regret my over enthusiastic support to the devs. Strongly not recommended.  I still like the free app. You just don\\'t get ANYTHING for this pro licence.",

        "comment": "A top app! Same great features as \\'Quit Smoking Log\\' - after all, this is just a license to unlock \\'pro\\' features of the app. 2nd day in & I\\'ve already found I smoke less than I estimated I did, without even trying to cut down! Set your goal for time between smokes and when you smoke the notification bar indicator turns red, after a time goes to amber & eventually to green to show you\\'re \\'allowed\\' to smoke. If you try to log a smoke before your target time\\'s up, the app gently tries to dissuade you. 5*!",

What it does is that it allows you to quit smoking in your own comfort, at your own speed. Who would have guessed keeping track of cigarettes smoked could actually help you ditch the damn habit??????",
