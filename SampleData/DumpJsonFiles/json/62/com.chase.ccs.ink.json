Your user experience across the board, with this app and your online banking is garbage. If I download an app to photograph and tag items, then it should be obvious how to do it. How about a button that says \\\"tag receipt\\\" and have a check box for the card? Also when I tag a purchase, why do I have to go back to another page to create a new tag? This is not rocket science.",
