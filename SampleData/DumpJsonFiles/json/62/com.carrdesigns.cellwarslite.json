But what worse is not only the game sound effect but the whole sound in my phone, means no ringtone (though my phone is not in silent mode) n i can\\'t even play mp3 or wav files with my music player. I have to restart my phone to get the sound back n when i play the game it just happened again. I\\'ve tried to reinstall the game but still no change. Help please, 5stars if it fixed",

Is this a bug or something to do with e.g. the implementation of the screen? or is it the drivers my device has? other than that the game per se is nice and funny.",

Also during opponents turn there is quite a lot of waiting. Would be nice to speed up turns. Gets annoying to wait, but really like game so please fix and I\\'ll buy it immediately. Cheers, Fiona  ** Just gave in and bought full version as I\\'m hoping it will perform better than the lite version... also I like this game so much despite its lags - have installed it on my 8 year old son\\'s android and he loves it too.",
