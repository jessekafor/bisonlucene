        "comment": "Charts are good. The previous guy who complained about registration is wrong. I would rather register on their website and give them the info I consider i shous give insted of letting to scan my personal info on my mobile device. In permissions they ask for internet access only. I,m not going to be srprised I because of that complint they will remove registration and will start to scan our devices. Lets hope it will no happen. I like the charts, they are greate. If you are trading these charts for you",
