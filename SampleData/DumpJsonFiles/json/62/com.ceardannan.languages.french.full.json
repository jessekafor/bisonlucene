Easy to practice your verb conjugations, vocabulary,  grammar and phrases with.This total course covers the following content:* All tenses, with all irregular verb forms highlighted* 4000+ words, sorted into different categories such as food, transport and vacation* 40 grammar articles, covering all French Grammar* 200 useful phrasesAnd the following features:* Highly customizable exercises on all of the above, with a fun awards system which makes practicing fun, with separate awards for the vocabulary, verbs, grammar, listening and speaking exercises.â¨* Keeping track of your progress by saving statistics and summaries of all done exercises, together with errors made.The first strength of this app is the extended content. No other French app offers this much for the same price. The other strength lies in its fun, addictive and useful exercises.The app also contains a fun speaking exercise, which should not be taken very seriously as it is now Also, although basic voices are included, it is also possible to enable additional higher quality voices from within the app, but these have to be bought first from the third party company Svox.If you are serious about learning French, this app is for you.IMPORTANT!We believe in a long term strategy for this app and customer feedback is very important to us. If there is something you do not like, please contact us at our developer email instead of giving us a 1 star rating. If you give us a 1 star rating, we do not even get your details so we cannot contact you back to solve the problem. If you contact us with a remark or problem and we fail to help you within a few days/weeks, depending on the severity of the problem, we understand that you give us a bad rating.Also, if your audio sounds way off, please read http://www.ceardannan.com/products/android-language-classes-text-to-speech.SOME COMPLIMENTS WE FOUND IN OUR MAILBOXYour language apps rock!! The interface is well designed, simple yet very very effective and it is as you described, very addictive.Your language apps are the best on the market. You offer far more for less. Unbelievable! I'm blown away by this app. It's almost as good as my pc version that I paid $$$ for except voice recognition could be better. Definitely worth the money.Perfect format. I like how quickly you jump on comments. Keep up the good work.PLANNED UPDATES* Writing exercises: the word, verb and grammar exercises will get a âwritingâ instead of multiple choice option, which will present the user with a textbox to type in instead of the multiple choice questions, for a bit more of a challenge.â¨* Image exercises, such as on clock times.* Making it possible to add your own words and phrases to the app through http://www.languageshq.com.",

        "comment": "Overall a very nice app.  Some minor glitches when displaying answers...  And one wrong grammar answer.  A very useful app for any intermediate french speaker who wants to solidify his/here\\'s grammar!   The grammar explanations are very rudimentary though and you will need other grammar books or such to help you find/understand the right answers !   And I like the cute teacher ;-) :-) ......  Only I would really appreciate the addition of an easy way to provide feedback in the paid version!!",
