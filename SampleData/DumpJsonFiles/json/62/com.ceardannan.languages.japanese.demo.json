        "comment": "This app has a great concept behind it; the UI is clean and clear, everything needed is there.  However, the app only gets two stars because it\\'s a little disappointing. The speaking is frankly ridiculous. Some times it recognises fine, whereas in others, it failed completely. If it was a little improved here and there, I would definitely consider keeping it. But for now, it\\'s being put to the side.",
