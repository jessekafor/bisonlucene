    "description": "CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You can train yourself (by writing down your thoughts) and studying what is untrue, unrealistic, and unfair about each thought. You will invent your own \"referee\" who will read each thought and give you a true, realistic and fair take. Over time it can help with depression.",

        "comment": "There is no referee. As the user, you have to create your own referee responses. This just logs what you write at a thought. You assign some categories to it. Then you write the referee responses. This was not clear in the descriptions. I thought I was getting an active referee--not just something to log thought and then MY OWN REFEREE response.   The main thing this app does is let you write down and catagorize your thoughts.  It is not as helpful as I expected it to be.  To me, it is not clear in the description that there is no active responding referee.",
