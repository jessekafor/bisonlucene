I also would like to be able to delete some locations from my History screen.  There are 12 slots for saving locations, but the only delete option is to wipe out all 12 rather than just one or two.  I think the only way to see altitude is to click on the Save Location (although you can cancel without saving).  I also use GPS Essentials which is more customizable but the interface isn\\'t as pretty.",

The only worthy enhancement over free GPS Test is \\\"Marking a waypoint\\\". Few things that the developer must add are 1. Add a waypoint (though this can be accomplished by marking a waypoint and editing it.. but it makes you think) 2. Capability to store more than JUST 12 waypoints. 3. Routing (Sewing waypoints together) 4. Capability to change Position Format in Navigate.  All these enhancements should be easy as other complex hardword is done just need to focus more on usefulness. Not sure why the deveoper missed them in the first place.  No more than 2 stars..:(",

Yes you can set the Grid format to UTM for the main display, but when you go to mark your current position the Lat / Long is still displayed in decimal degrees.  This means you can\\'t edit that position to represent, say, a particular mountain pass then navigate to it.  Not even in the paid for version. So its OK as a fun toy but for serious backcountry navigation, forget it.",

My car GPS gets the location almost instantaneously, this app takes minutes and occasionaly it fails, e.g. on an island or at sea. It could be due to a limitation related to my device (Nexus 4) but I doubt it because I can see the app appears to detect up to 10 satellites in the first few seconds upon launch and then it takes a long time to compute the location.",
