        "comment": "I\\'m a user of the SPH-D710 and when I purchased the app it advertised separate controls for my Bluetooth  headset because the Android OS doesn\\'t do this natively . I found out after the 15 minute refund period that it doesn\\'t control the notification volume separately from the at all even if I mute everything but the \\\"Media\\\" and \\\"Voice Call\\\". My main problem is that they won\\'t acknowledge me at all. Not even that they received my email and would get back to me soon. I have reached out to the calmly 4 times and gave them every chance to make things right or tell me that they are aware of it or that it\\'s on their list of bug fixes but I haven\\'t heard a peep. If you want to pay for GUI to control your volume just like your OS does for free then this app is for you but if I were you I would stay away from any app developer that won\\'t stand behind something that they sale.",

Asked for refund....NOTHING. I do not recomend this and save a buck!!!! Wait till there are no more 1 stars for a while. If they fix it, I would give it 5 stars and be more than happy to give them a dollar...oh, I already did lol, but no fix",
