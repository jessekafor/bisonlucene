        "comment": "Doesn\\'t seem to have any means of controlling what information is displayed - just a long unsorted and uncategorised list of traffic reports from all over the country.   I\\'ve tried tapping all over the screen but nothing appears.   How is it that other reviewers can rave about it, while others like me find it useless - is there a download/installation problem?  Chartcross tell me to use the menu button.   Have they not read what I have written?    There is no menu button.   There are no controls anywhere.",

Uninstalled mainly due to the SD card deficiency.",
