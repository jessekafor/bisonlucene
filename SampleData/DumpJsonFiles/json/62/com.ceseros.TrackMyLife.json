    "description": "Find out where you spend your Life!Â« Winning App of the Microsoft App Revolution Â»Â« Selected App of the Month by Connect Magazine, WParea, etc Â»Find out where you spend your life!How much time do I spend at Work? How long do I stay there in the end? Where do I spend most of my time?Track my Life answers these and many more questions for you. 100% AUTOMATICALLY.By running in the background mode of your phone.By embracing state of the art features of your phone, it DOESN'T even have an effect on the energy consumption of your phone.Track my Life has won prizes and has been featured by several websites including wpcentral.com, wparea.de, appdealswp.com, etc.**** PERMISSIONS ****+ Location: Obvious+ Network Communication: Required to display the map, enable Facebook sharing, backup functionality. WE DO NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA. YOUR DATA BELONGS TO YOU AND NOONE ELSE!+ Start at boot: The background agent starts at boot time.**** BACKUP ****You can backup your data via SkyDrive and restore it on your Windows Phone/iPhone/iPad/Android.**** SHARING ****You can share your data and screenshots on Facebook. Twitter, Foursquare, and Latitude are planned.The statistics feature shows you how many kilometers you've traveled the past 24 hours, past week, past month and all time. It shows how many cities you've been to and where you've spent most of your time, too.Differences to other GPS trackers:Track my Life is not just an GPS Tracker or GPS Tracking tool. It agglomerates your tracking data to make sense. It can be compared to Latitude and Foursquare.Track down how long you have been at certain places. Record all your GPS data in background.GPS tracking in background:Track my Life runs completely in background and tracks you every 30 minutes. It does not actually use GPS, it uses just the most recent GPS coordinate the system took anyways. Thereby, GPS tracking does not even have an effect on your devices battery.Track My Life is not Latitude client. Track my Life is by far the most intelligent GPS tracker on the marketplace. Developed by students of the technical university of munich who are specialized in GPS tracking topics. Track My Life cannot be compared to Foursquare.",

UPDATE. I\\'ve used this app for one day. It says I\\'ve been to two places and two cities in  one day, in fact I went to three places but never left, or even came close to leaving the city! Still cannot believe they are trying to sell the detailed statistics when not even the basic statistics are correct! Shame on the developers!",
