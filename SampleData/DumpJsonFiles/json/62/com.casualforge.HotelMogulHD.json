        "comment": "If a little one dimensional.   Presents enough maths challenges,  combined with need for speed,  to eat up a few of your hours. The levels seem a bit random at times and the filler / minigames are pointless. How about replacing these with more depth to the main game?  Minor quibbles tho to an otherwise good game.",
