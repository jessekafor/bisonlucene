        "comment": "I downloaded this app to help track my nursing for my newborn. Even bought the premium app so I could record diapers, pumping, and supplementing. I report it every time it crashes, and that happens multiple times per day. Otherwise, the function of the app is nice. Don\\'t see the necessity to record the \\\"notes\\\" applied from the previous diaper change to the current one. Also, when starting a nursing session,  I select R or L and after completion, I have to reselect that option. Fix for better rating.",
