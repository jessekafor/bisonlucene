The only hiccup was the weird bug with the backspace key on the swiftkey keyboard, where it pasted the last few characters over and over instead of deleting anything. Other keyboards (stock, swype, and messagease) all work fine.",

And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just with swift key but sometimes I\\'ll hit backspace and it just adds more of the letter I am trying to erase.",

It only saves files on Celtx cloud,  2. Comic Script has poor formatting functions. As of this writing, when you create Pages & Panels it does format to make the necessary entries, but when you save the file and download it to your desktop, the script has extra Page & Panel markups! You will then be spending time editing these out! An annoying bug!  3. No undo/redo.",

However, writing isn\\'t as easy as it should be because for some reason the text editor on the app garbles up SwiftKey\\'s predicted text. This doesn\\'t happen though with the stock Samsung keyboard or Swype so the problem might be SwiftKey specific but then again I\\'ve never encountered this problem with any other app.",

        "comment": "I came to Script mobile late and was hoping that with all the feedback they\\'ve been getting since its Apple days, they would have made the app somewhat functional. I don\\'t believe they would have to reinvent word processing to include simple features like undo,  a clipboard and a few really practical page navigation features. It is still bare, and they are charging $10 for it. They forget we don\\'t use their software because they are pretty people. We are \\\"loyal\\\" only because we associate the name Celtx with quality. They have an  awesome desktop application. But they believe they have reached the top of the mountain, and are resting on their Laurels. They only seem to want to \\\"monetize\\\" every piece of trash with Celtx tattooed on it. But  it\\'s only a matter of time before someone else fills the void. That\\'s how great products die. They stop respecting their customers. Please make it usable and charge even more, if you have to. We will probably pay! For now, I will write in some all purpose word processor while on the road, clipboard it into Celtx desktop and format. But who really wants to do triple duty! Do something before you die! Mobile is the future, not necessarily CLOUD.",

It has great potential to being a big part of my writing workflow, but sadly it\\'s kind of crippling when it comes to novel writing.",

        "comment": "App is great, everything works as advertised.... Documentation sucks, so finding out if it works as advertised takes effort - going onto celtx website forums. (Hate forums). Also - to save locally there\\'s no pop up telling what folder being saved to. Only saves when exit completely (not hit home button) App looks like it might crash without any \\'Saving\\' type pop up. Took a lot of effort to find out if local storage actually worked or not. Almost lost a customer (at least on the mobile platform).  Please do not send customers to a forum as the only means of help. I just need simple documentation that every other full fledged program has. I can usually work it out from there. Searching through forums, with weak search algorithms and multiple week waits for responses is a complete buzz kill.  Otherwise, love the desktop app, love the cloud service (now that I discovered it saves to a website profile that you can actually edit inside the web browser) - Again, I\\'ve used the desktop and mobile app for over a year and never knew about the website browser editor. The mobile app could use some tweaking - include more desktop features into the tablet port of the mobile app.  But I\\'m happy!!!",
