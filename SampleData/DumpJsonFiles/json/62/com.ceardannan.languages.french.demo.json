The full version comes with tons of content, while the content of this demo is rather limited.The app also contains a fun speaking exercise, which should not be taken very seriously as it is now Also, although basic voices are included, it is also possible to enable additional higher quality voices from within the app, but these have to be bought first from the third party company Svox.If you are serious about learning French, please give this demo a try.IMPORTANTWe believe in a long term strategy for this app and customer feedback is very important to us. If there is something you do not like, please contact us at our developer email instead of giving us a 1 star rating. If you give us a 1 star rating, we do not even get your details so we cannot contact you back to solve the problem. If you contact us with a remark or problem and we fail to help you within a few days/weeks, depending on the severity of the problem, we understand that you give us a bad rating.Also, if your audio sounds way off, please read http://www.ceardannan.com/products/android-language-classes-text-to-speech.PLANNED UPDATES* Writing exercises: the word, verb and grammar exercises will get a âwritingâ instead of multiple choice option, which will present the user with a textbox to type in instead of the multiple choice questions, for a bit more of a challenge.â¨* Image exercises, such as on clock times.* Making it possible to add your own words and phrases to the app through http://www.languageshq.com.",

The \\\"-\\\" isn\\'t supposed to be pronounced at all! It is there to mark inversion. Horrible! Because of this it gets wrong liaisons in 70% of cases, and teaches the beginners something that is NOT FRENCH!  FIX IT PLEASE!! IT\\'S A HAZZARD!  Edit: Apparently it depends on your device whether the punctuation is pronounced or not. And the grammar part is rather simpflied, but still ok.",
