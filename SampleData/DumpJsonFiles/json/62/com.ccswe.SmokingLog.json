        "comment": "Best for figuring out what your avg is. Can edit or add smokes later. This is good even if you are just thinking about quitting.  The first step is realizing how much you smoke.  I tracked myself for 10 days and started out with my worst days average and now I add a minute a day (between smokes) to my average and I don\\'t add minutes over the weekend. It\\'s better than nothing and it adds up over time. I may speed up my decrease after I get some space between me and these things, but doing something is better than nothing. Baby steps Bob:) If this helps me quit. I\\'m paying the guy somehow. He should have a paid reward app like angry birds space for $5 and $1 goes to the american cancer society.",
