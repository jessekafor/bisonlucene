        "comment": "This is a decent tower defence game, however for me there are a couple of concerns.  There is a glitch that happens if you save and exit the game as the enemies are coming out of the start gate it will count them as escaping when you resume.\\tThe flame tower does not pair with radar towers. I don\\'t  know if that was intended or if it is a glitch, but it makes the flame tower a tower I never use. The condenser is listed as being the most powerful weapon, but I find it useless, even fully upgraded in the weapons shop. It does not seem to aim properly and does little damage. Cannon towers seem to suffer from aiming problems as well.  Some enemies  are immune to freeze tower.  Using all prisms all the time makes it become repetitive before long.",
