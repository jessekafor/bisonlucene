Download the app for free and sample some of the talks. Upgrade to the full version to have unlimited access to the complete library.These MP3's are streamed to your Android device, not downloaded, so they take up no storage space.  A connection is required for the MP3 to play properly.If you have already purchased the full library on another Android device, you can unlock it again by downloading the free version, selecting the \"Upgrade\" button, and going through the purchase process again. You will not be charged again. HAVING PROBLEMS?** Try uninstalling and reinstall the free app, then upgrade again. Any time you reinstall an app you purchased,you have to go through the upgrade process again.  You will not actually be charged again **** New device? Same as the above directions for reinstalling. **** Google Plays won't let you reinstall saying \"you already own it\"?  This is a bug they are working on but have not fixed yet.  We have a work around in the meantime.  Please email us at catholicvault@gmail.com to request instructions. **",

        "title": "Poor horrible app",
        "comment": "This app distracts you from praying the rosary. The music is loud you could barely hear the prayer. And the music choice doesn\\'t help you meditate while praying. In fact it makes you not pray at all. The people praying are rushing to pray and seems like they just want to get it over with. This is not how to pray. There is no sincerity. I can feel it. I couldn\\'t finish the rosary using this app. I wanted something to help me pray. I am better off reciting the prayer alone.",
