The area is a place for families to thrive and inspire.People are a little kinder here. Neighbors are happy to lend each other a hand, and strangers say hello. Families are a little stronger here, too. Itâs all thanks to a community spirit that brings our cities together for many unique celebrations like First Night and Cats Incredible and events like Art Fest and the Potato Bowl. Itâs a better place, thanks to the people. We invite you to experience it for yourself.Welcome to picture-perfect neighborhoods, where turn-of-the-century Victorian homes meet modern architecture.
