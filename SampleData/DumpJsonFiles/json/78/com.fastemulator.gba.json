The remote link has MANY issues. Like random frames drop and all that. So after thats fix then 10000 stars! Reply: I have 30MB/S internet and not alot of people were on. So connection is no issue. But if you can focus a bit more on remote play it will be appreciated! Thanks! Also quick replys are always nice.",

The only thing I want in this emulator is that if there was an option to use the GBA Wireless Adapter (that should be built in). This app is awesome and this GBA emulator really stands out from the others and is very unique in every way possible. Thank You for making such an awesome emulator. :) <3  Ps. Let there be a cheat book in the app, that has Game shark and Action Replay codes built in please! :)",
