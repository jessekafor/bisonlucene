The show centers on protagonist Jackson \"Jax\" Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the then-vice president of the club, who begins questioning the club and himself. Sons of Anarchy premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The third season of the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX's highest rated series ever, surpassing FX's other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me. The season 4 and 5 premieres (\"Out\" and \"Sovereign\", respectively), both directed by series Executive Producer and Principal Director Paris Barclay and written by series creator and Executive Producer Kurt Sutter (along with staff writers Brady Dahl and Roberto Patino), were the two highest-rated telecasts in FX's history. On February 3, 2012, Sons of Anarchy was renewed for two additional seasons, a fifth and a sixth. Those involved in the production of the series imply that a seventh and final season is creator Kurt Sutter's plan.DISCLAIMER: Sons of Anarchy FanFront is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sons of Anarchy entities, or the FX Network.
