One,  I can\\'t even see the input because the letters are a light grey instead of black on my Samsung galaxy iii. Two,  how do you even choose the year in which the child is born? I\\'ll still recommend the app, but the birthday can be fixed to be a simple input boxes like the rest of the form.",

It took me forever and im surprised that I was able to enter the correct date especially the year it sort of just appeared. So please fix issues.",

I did see where a password can be created and it could be locked and unlocked. However, I am not sure if this is the app or my phone but with my phone I would touch the lock and it indicates on or off but the created password still shows (it\\'s just grayed out). What would be the purpose of creating a PW if I  lock it and someone gets a hold of my phone and retouches the  indicated lock to unlock  with the password already in view.  Therefore, I would only enter information such as the City, state and zip code, son. first name, my first name, all phone numbers ect.. Not sure how this will assist me using the app. Just being cautious about where I put my personal information.   That needs some more thought put into it. But overall I will give a rating as a 3",
