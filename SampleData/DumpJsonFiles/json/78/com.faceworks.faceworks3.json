Thank you!â\"I'm a life coach - I find your videos excellent; clear & easy to follow - all the exercises for the price of a pot of face cream!âI've followed the exercise programme since January and am very pleased with the results already. I had been doing a VERY well-known American face exercise program for 10 years & I didn't think my face would improve that much but it has, so thank you very much!â âI've just looked at my passport photo taken 3 years ago. I'm amazed at the changes in my face: my eyelids have lifted, my cheeks and lips look fuller, and my jowls are lessening' It makes so much sense we exercise our bodies so why not our faces - I feel so much better about myselfâ.See more reviews on the Results page on the Faceworks website www.faceworks.co.uk/results/Faceworks is the only face exercise program approved by the Complementary Therapistsâ Association, a leading UK professional association.The videos show 51 year old therapist and creator of Faceworks, Elaine Bartlett.
