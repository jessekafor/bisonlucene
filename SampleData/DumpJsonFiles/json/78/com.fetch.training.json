        "comment": "We were seriously considering giving up our out of control dog before getting this app. She was trained in 1 afternoon. Sorry i mean we were trained in 1 afternoon as it was more about teaching us than her. She had done nothing wrong it was us not training her properly that caused the behavior issues. Thank you so much.",
