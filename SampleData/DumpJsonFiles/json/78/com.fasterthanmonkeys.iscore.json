In our league coach pitch after 4 walks and full time 5th inning and above or if kids hit two batters in one inning. Also find it to time consuming to adjust to batting order changes.  I\\'ve only used it for 5 games so far.  Still looking into stats to track my son\\'s putching per game.  But still the best app I\\'ve used like it",
