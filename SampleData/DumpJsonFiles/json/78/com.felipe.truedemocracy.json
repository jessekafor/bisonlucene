    "description": "Take the lead of your country in a realistic political simulation game! You are free to do any kind of government action that you want in power, from increasing the health care to decreasing taxation, but be careful as each action will have an impact on what your voters think of you and also in the government debt. Guide your country as the years go by until you reach an election. If you win the election, you stay in power. If you lose it, another political party will take the government, but the game does not end! You can wait until an economic depression or a mistake by the ruling party takes you back to power!",

        "comment": "Good gameplay with the exception that its too easy to manipulate the economy. Once you have negative national debt, cancel all taxes and give your citizens everything - you will never run out of cash! Please fix this Dev!!!   Shows great potential though and has kept me occupied for hours. Foreign relations, war, UN resolutions, civil unrest and the option to change your parties political stance would be good - as would the option to create your own party!",
