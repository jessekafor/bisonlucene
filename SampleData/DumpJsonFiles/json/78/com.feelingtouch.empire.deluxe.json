Since my Samsung Epic 2 got updated to Android 4.0, all menus and pop-ups are compressed horizontally, making them impossible to read.  And as a bonus, the contact email address provided on the download page has been deactivated.  Not gonna waste my time trying to find a valid email address for these people. And, they don\\'t show this game on their website, so I guess they aren\\'t supporting it anymore.",
