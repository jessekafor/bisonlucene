The only problem is that it randomly disconnects frequently and the computer program frequently gets an error and stops working.  Worth the money though. UPDATE:updating the software on my computer seemed to do the trick.  Sprint finally fixed our internet signal so I was finally able to try it out and I haven\\'t had to reconnect once.  Thank you for your help!!",
