    "description": "This unique application is for all students across the world. It covers 143 topics of Material Science in detail. These 143 topics are divided in 3 units.Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.This USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from anywhere they like.Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF MATERIALS2.\tENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF MATERIALS3.\tClassification of engineering materials4.\tOrganic and inorganic materials5.\tSemiconductors6.\tBiomaterials7.\tCURRENT TRENDS AND ADVANCES IN MATERIALS8.\tAdvanced materials9.\tSmart materials (materials of the future)10.\tNanostructured materials and nanotechnology11.\tQuantum dots12.\tSpintronics13.\tLevel of material structure examination and observation14.\tMaterial structure15.\tEngineering metallurgy16.\tSelection of the materials17.\tAtomic concepts in physics and chemistry18.\tAtomic Structure: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS19.\tAtomic Structure: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS20.\tELECTRONS IN ATOMS21.\tTHE PERIODIC TABLE22.\tBONDING FORCES AND ENERGIES23.\tIonic Bonding24.\tCovalent Bonding25.\tMetallic Bonding26.\tSECONDARY BONDING OR VAN DER WAALS BONDING27.\tCrystal Structures: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS28.\tThe Face-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure29.\tThe Body-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure30.\tThe Hexagonal Close-Packed Crystal Structure31.\tCRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PLANES32.\tCRYSTAL SYSTEMS33.\tPOINT COORDINATES34.\tCRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DIRECTIONS35.\tHexagonal Crystals36.\tAtomic Arrangements37.\tCLOSE-PACKED CRYSTAL STRUCTURES38.\tVACANCIES AND SELF-INTERSTITIALS39.\tIMPURITIES IN SOLIDS40.\tDISLOCATIONS - LINEAR DEFECTS41.\tINTERFACIAL DEFECTS42.\tMicroscopic Examination43.\tOptical Microscopy44.\tElectron Microscopy45.\tGRAIN SIZE DETERMINATION46.\tIntroduction to mechanical properties47.\tCONCEPTS OF STRESS AND STRAIN48.\tCompression Tests49.\tSTRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOR50.\t ANELASTICITY51.\tELASTIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS52.\tPlastic Deformation53.\tYielding and Yield Strength54.\tTensile Strength55.\tDuctility56.\tResilience57.\tToughness58.\tTRUE STRESS AND STRAIN59.\tELASTIC RECOVERY AFTER PLASTIC DEFORMATION60.\tHARDNESS61.\tRockwell Hardness Tests62.\tBrinell Hardness Tests63.\tKnoop and Vickers Microindentation Hardness Tests64.\tHardness Conversion65.\tCorrelation Between Hardness and Tensile Strength66.\tVARIABILITY OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES67.\tComputation of Average and Standard Deviation Values68.\tDESIGN/SAFETY FACTORS69.\tPhase diagrams-introduction70.\tSOLUBILITY LIMIT71.\tPHASES72.\tPHASE EQUILIBRIA73.\tONE-COMPONENT (OR UNARY) PHASE DIAGRAMS74.\tBinary Phase Diagrams75.\tBINARY ISOMORPHOUS SYSTEMS76.\tDetermination of Phase Compositions77.\tDetermination of Phase Amounts78.\tEquilibrium Cooling79.\tNonequilibrium Cooling80.\tMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS81.\tBINARY EUTECTIC SYSTEMS82.\tDEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN EUTECTIC ALLOYS83.\tEQUILIBRIUM DIAGRAMS HAVING INTERMEDIATE PHASES OR COMPOUNDS84.\tEUTECTOID AND PERITECTIC REACTIONS85.\tCONGRUENT PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS86.\tTHE GIBBS PHASE RULE87.\tTHE IRON-IRON CARBIDE (Fe-Fe3C) PHASE DIAGRAM88.\tDEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN IRON-CARBON ALLOYS89.\tHypoeutectoid Alloys90.\tHypereutectoid Alloys91.\t THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER ALLOYING ELEMENTS92.\tFERROUS ALLOYS93.\tLow-Carbon Steels94.\tMedium-Carbon Steels95.\tHigh-Carbon Steels96.\tStainless Steels97.\tCast Irons98.\tGray Iron99.\tDuctile (or Nodular) IronAll topics are not listed because of character limitations set by the Play Store.",
