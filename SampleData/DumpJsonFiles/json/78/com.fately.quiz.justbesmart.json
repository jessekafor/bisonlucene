I am not sure if this is normal, or if this is just my phone?! I would really enjoy this game even more if it had good questions. And didn\\'t tell me I was wrong. Also one of my questions was, \\\"What talker?\\\" \\\"Elephant, Giraffe, Lion\\\" I put Giraffe and it said it was Lion. AND yes this so called \\\"Quiz\\\" has grammar problems. \\343\\200\\234",
