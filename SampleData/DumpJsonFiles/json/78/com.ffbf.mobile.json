        "title": "Problem with deposits",
        "comment": "I overall like the app, but with my old samsung galaxy I had to try several times to get a deposit accepted.  I upgraded to the S4 and now can\\'t send deposits at all.  When I try to put in the amount the keyboard pop up has only numbers on it--no symbols---not even a decimal point.  So the amount can\\'t reflect cents and so is unacceptable by the program.  The bank says it\\'s not their problem. Verizon says it\\'s not the phone.  When I type anywhere other than the ffsb app.the full qwerty keyboard pops up.",
