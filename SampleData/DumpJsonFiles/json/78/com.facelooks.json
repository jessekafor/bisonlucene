    "description": "Facelook is an app to take a snap of any person, but unlike other apps which you need not turn on the camera of your phone to be turned on. Just the screen of your phone will be sufficient to take a photo in no time, for any of the social media sites or just for the gallery. This app works on the basis of a few simple questions about the person whose photo needs to be clicked. The perfect resolution of the photo will keep you awestruck. However, to get the perfect photo you need to answer all the questions honestly, and bingo! In minutes you can see your photo on the screen. The only limitation of this app is that it can take the photo of your face. Soon, we will update the next version where you can get the photo of your whole body, without using the camera! This is an app you would love to share with your friends too! So, what are you waiting for? Just download the app and start answering the questions.",
