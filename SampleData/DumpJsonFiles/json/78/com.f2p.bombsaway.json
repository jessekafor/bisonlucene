        "comment": "First impressions... Straight forward and fun, I was really glad I tried the game out. I haven\\'t played a lot yet, but there was plenty of variation already in the first several levels. Difficulty ramps up pretty fast, and boosts are introduced to compensate with meaningful changes to the mechanics--I think I got speedshot, and it was sweet. Anyway, Atomic Attack is a quick, skill-shot game that fits well into the small intervals of down time I have during the day. I\\'m looking forward to what else unlocks as I play more.",

It\\'s really quiet when playing and feels weird given I\\'m trying to stop bombs from destroying the city. Maybe a zap sound and a more serious noise when hitting a bomb. Game plays well and looks good too",
