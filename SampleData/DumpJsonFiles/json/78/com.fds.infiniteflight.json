The developers are clearly invested in making a good product and I look forward to future additions/improvements. I do wish the price tag weren\\'t so steep for some of the extra aircraft, but I\\'ve thus far enjoyed this game more than I do X-Plane.   I suggest adding Vancouver or Seattle as a locale, and perhaps a modern turbo-prop like the Q400.",

This game has HUGE potential to be a supplement to even PC flight sims if you enabled more interaction in the cockpit or were able to have emergencies. Oh...and C-17s fly backside meaning anything after 1/2 flap -- power = lift and pitch = speed. I would know since I fly them in the AF. THANKS GUYS!",
