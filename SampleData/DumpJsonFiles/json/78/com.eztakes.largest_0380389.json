    "description": "If you liked MA BARKER'S KILLER BROOD you'll definitely want to see this schlocker about the rise and fall of America's most famous criminals. Dillinger is played by Healy. Crane plays Johnny Van Meter. Ma Barker is a little on the geeky side. Bonnie & Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson are also featured. Very entertaining with almost non stop action....more at www.eztakes.com. (Duration: 56 Minutes)",
