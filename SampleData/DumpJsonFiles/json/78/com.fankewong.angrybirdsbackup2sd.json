I am assuming this is likely due to a possible loop that happens when the program is running checks for compatibility or something and verifying the integrity of the file too. If this is what is causing it maybe implement a hash reader creator into the process instead of what ever method you are using at the moment. I am just guessing by the way as to possibles",

I was too scared to risk all my hours ( + weeks) of playing with some of the other similar apps, but I needed to free up some space on my LG E-400 (android 2.3.6) and this worked perfectly. It was so simple and straightforward to save my progress (+ I checked it did work following ALL the instructions (i.e. I saved then uninstalled AB Space + Rio. I installed them again from Google Play. I completed one level on each. I restored my previous progress using this app. I think some people have complained because they haven\\'t been paying attention to the easy instructions.) Thank you very much Frankie Wong!!",
