    "description": "Klink is a utility by Faveset LLC for connecting a PC or Mac to your Android device over USB.  It focuses on simplicity and gets the job done with a few taps.  Yet, it is one of the fastest of its kind.  Power users also won't feel left out, as it has many mobile-specific settings that don't exist anywhere else.Installation is simple like with EasyTether or PdaNet, and the in-app setup guide walks you through everything in less than 10 minutes.The original version has over 20,000 paid users and an average Market rating above 4.3, so everything is well-tested, but please don't hesitate to email and ask questions!NOTE: Please try the free demo version (\"Klink - Tether Demo\" on the market) to test compatibility before buying.  Klink should work with every device out there, so don't hesitate to contact support if you need help.  The demo can be upgraded via the market without any further configuration on your computer.FEATURES:- Supports Windows (XP/Vista/7/8/32-bit/64-bit), Mac OS X 10.5 (or later), and Ubuntu Linux (32-bit/64-bit).  * Ubuntu binaries can be used with other Linux distributions (also tested with Fedora and Arch).- This is only for USB connections to a PC or Mac.  Tablets are not supported!- Does not require a rooted device- It has a unique Mimic Mobile Device mode that lets you browse mobile pages as the device of your choosing to conserve data.  Moreover, this mode can also block common background data activity to avoid excessive data usage.- Written in C (NOT Java) for efficiency, speed, and lower power consumption.  * Is fast and capable of handling 4g speeds: can reach 30mbps in real-world conditions on capable devices.NOTE TO PURCHASERS OF THE ORIGINAL KLINK: Your purchase is still valid, and it is NOT necessary to buy this version.  Please visit the \"Download\" page at www.faveset.com to download the original version of Klink, or email support if you have questions.USAGE:After installing and running Klink, please tap \"Set up your Computer\" and follow the instructions.  Klink requires the installation of a small companion program on your PC or Mac, so following the step-by-step guide is suggested.HELP: Please visit the Google Group via http://www.faveset.com/klink/support, or email klink@faveset.com.It would be appreciated if you asked for help before posting negative feedback, as virtually all problems can be resolved.  Otherwise, please leave your email address when commenting so that someone can get in touch with you.As some users may have difficulty evaluating everything within the 15-minute refund window, a once-per-user 24-hour return policy is in effect; simply include your order number when contacting support.  No one should feel rushed.  Please contact support if you need any help during setup.PERMISSIONS:CHECK_LICENSE - Needed for Android Market license verification.INTERNET - Requires a data connection.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Used for downloading companion files during setup.",
