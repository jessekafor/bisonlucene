    "description": "Better Kings is a two-game variation of the popular drinking game King's Cup. It includes Kings and Kings Cup. This app is perfect for situations that involve alcohol but no cards, like the airport or a picnic. King's Cup is also known as Ring of Fire, Circle of Death, Sociables and the Kingâs Game.Better Kings aims to be exactly what its name implies: a better version of Kings for the Android system. Please feel free to comment or email with suggestions for improvement or new rules.Better Kings supports two Kings games, King's Cup and King's Beer. To start, get an empty cup for King's Cup or a full beer for King's Beer, and place it in the center of the table. Each player takes a turn drawing a new card, and everyone at the table must follow the rule associated with that card. Better Kings will display the rule at the bottom right of the screen, and you can click the text for a popup display of the rule. In King's Cup, each time a player drinks they must pour a little of their drink into the center cup. When a king is drawn, that player must drink the center cup. In King's Beer with a real deck of cards, all discarded cards are slotted into the tab of a beer can. Whichever player cracks open the beer with their card must drink the beer. Better Kings fakes this using random numbers for each card.The free version is ad-supported and has fixed rules. There will be a paid version coming soon that has no ads and allows you to customize the rule for each card.",
