It is also called geomancy, a form of divination. The doctrine teaches that there is an energy called Qi (or Chi) flowing throughout the universe in lines, sometimes called meridians or channels. It claims to balance the Yin and Yang in the environment. Good fortune and quality of life are enhanced by surrounding ourselves with things of beauty. Dish fountains with trickling water soothing to your ears, are just one of the characteristics of decorating according to Feng Shui. These types of items will enable us to be more peace-loving and kind. If we envelop ourselves with symbols of death and indifference towards nature and other people, we will corrupt ourselves.This wallpaper contains a number of feng shui symbols. For example, a dragon symbol is a powerful and auspicious traditional cure and an excellent symbol of strong yang / male energy. The money cat's beckoning paw signifies wealth arriving. She attracts money, luck, prosperity and new opportunities.The Mystic Knot is one of the most often used symbols in feng shui. This knot symbolizes a long and happy life full of good fortune. The statuette of a three-legged frog with a coin in its mouth âthe character of the famous Chinese fairy tale is said to bring wealth and success as well.Have the pictures of this symbols on your new live wallpaper and envelop yourself with good fortune.",
