    "description": "AirPush Ads Detector is an Android easy-to-use utility, which helps to find installed applications that send various annoying notifications from Airpush, Leadbolt, Xapush, Appenda, IAC, MoolahMedia., and others. After detecting , Push-up Detector will suggest to switch to annoying application properties for the further actions, i.e. uninstallation.   Unlike other applications that only detect well-known malware (Airpush, Leadbolt, Xapush, Appenda, IAC, MoolahMedia., and others),  Push-up Detector will help you to detect  those applications in particular, out of 100-200 installed ones, that disturb you with spam. IMPORTATANT: AirPush Detector does not require superuser permissions (root). Application is installed as a system service.THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT BLOCK NOTIFICATIONS. It only allows you to find which applications send annoying notifications. In order to get rid of spam, you will have to uninstall yourself applications that spread spam.During the first launch you will be asked to turn on app as a service: it is necessary to switch it on. Push up Detector will be able to perform its functions and help youonly running as a service.What to do in Main:This is the main section of the application. Here you can find the list of applications that had been noticed to be sending notifications and had not been added into White List. If you noticed an icon or notification text, that has been disturbing you, in the list of applications, just press on it and in the pop-up window choose Application Properties in order to shift to the application properties where you will be able to uninstall it. If you cannot find the needed icon from the list, try to check White-List, you could have added application to this list earlier.What is a White-List:This is a list of your applications that can send various important notifications. You can modify it on your own. After adding the application to White-List, AirPush Detector continues to control it, but will not show it on the main list.AirPush Detector:In this section you will be able to check the device on presence of malicious applications known by AirPush Detector and decided whether uninstall applications or not. If you came up with any questions, you may want to watch a video on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKuKyrFCWeI or write an email to technical support.",
