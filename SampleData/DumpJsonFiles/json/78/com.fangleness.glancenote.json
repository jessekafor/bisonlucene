After trying all the Simplenote apps, I settled on Glance Note because it syncs properly and has a light-colored background.  I would like to see the sort option made persistent between sessions and greater control over font size. Otherwise, it works well.  Update 7/3/2013 Glad to see offline editing implemented - good work. Sort order still not persistent.",
