Clunky interface, doesn\\'t remember settings, doesn\\'t load articles in background, several screens until you get to content, no easy way to pass from one article to another.  Try pulse instead .. works with readability and much nicer interface.  If you have a decent browser (non exist for android yet) the readability mobile website is not bad.",
