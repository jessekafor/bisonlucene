        "comment": "Some obvious coding shortcomings make the import of gedcom files unnecessarily complex. The app doesn\\'t install itself as a default handler for .GED files.  This makes the display of cloud-based trees a three-step process.  On the other hand, this is a good way to display a tree on a tablet.   With a bit of tweaking I would be prepared to go for the paid version.",

        "comment": "Simple but displays info nicely. Very easy and intuitive UI where you can click any name of parents, siblings, or children to navigate around quickly. I\\'m using it just as a viewer only but data is editable so great for research at family events. Works great and is free. (I do wish the tree view included the spouse of the selected individual).",

No birth, death, marriage dates on family summary page (you have to go to a different page, even if the was plenty of space on the big tablet screen). Tree view truncates names. Good enough to play with but not to buy.",
