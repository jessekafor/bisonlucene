    "description": "This unique application is for all students of Artificial Intelligence across the world. It covers 142 topics of Artificial Intelligence in detail. These 142 topics are divided in 5 units. Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.The USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from any where they like. Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tTuring test2.\tIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence3.\tHistory of AI4.\tThe AI Cycle5.\tKnowledge Representation6.\tTypical AI problems7.\tLimits of AI8.\tIntroduction to Agents9.\tAgent Performance10.\tIntelligent Agents11.\tStructure Of Intelligent Agents12.\tTypes of agent program13.\tGoal based Agents14.\tUtility-based agents15.\tAgents and environments16.\tAgent architectures17.\tSearch for Solutions18.\tState Spaces19.\tGraph Searching20.\tA Generic Searching Algorithm21.\tUninformed Search Strategies22.\tBreadth-First Search23.\tHeuristic Search24.\tAÃÂ¢Ãâ Ã¢â¬â Search25.\tSearch Tree26.\tDepth first Search27.\tProperties of Depth First Search28.\tBi-directional search29.\tSearch Graphs30.\tInformed Search Strategies31.\tMethods of Informed Search32.\tGreedy Search33.\tProof of Admissibility of A*34.\tProperties of Heuristics35.\tIterative-Deepening A*36.\tOther Memory limited heuristic search37.\tN-Queens eample38.\tAdversarial Search39.\tGenetic Algorithms40.\tGames41.\tOptimal decisions in Games42.\tminimax algorithm43.\tAlpha Beta Pruning44.\tBacktracking45.\tConsistency Driven Techniques46.\tPath Consistency (K-Consistency)47.\tLook Ahead48.\tPropositional Logic49.\tSyntax of Propositional Calculus50.\tKnowledge Representation and Reasoning51.\tPropositional Logic Inference52.\tPropositional Definite Clauses53.\tKnowledge-Level Debugging54.\tRules of Inference55.\tSoundness and Completeness56.\tFirst Order Logic57.\tUnification58.\tSemantics59.\tHerbrand Universe60.\tSoundness, Completeness, Consistency, Satisfiability61.\tResolution62.\tHerbrand Revisited63.\tProof as Search64.\tSome Proof Strategies65.\tNon-Monotonic Reasoning66.\tTruth Maintenance Systems67.\tRule Based Systems68.\tPure Prolog69.\tForward chaining70.\tbackward Chaining71.\tChoice between forward and backward chaining72.\tAND/OR Trees73.\tHidden Markov Model74.\tBayesian networks75.\tLearning Issues76.\tSupervised Learning77.\tDecision Trees78.\tKnowledge Representation Formalisms79.\tSemantic Networks80.\tInference in a Semantic Net81.\tExtending Semantic Nets82.\tFrames83.\tSlots as Objects84.\tInterpreting frames85.\tIntroduction to Planning 86.\tProblem Solving vs. Planning87.\tLogic Based Planning88.\tPlanning Systems89.\tPlanning as Search90.\tSituation-Space Planning Algorithms91.\tPartial-Order Planning92.\tPlan-Space Planning Algorithms93.\tInterleaving vs. Non-Interleaving of Sub-Plan Steps94.\tSimple Sock/Shoe Example95.\tProbabilistic Reasoning96.\tReview of Probability Theory97.\tSemantics of Bayesian Networks98.\tIntroduction to Learning99.\tTaxonomy of Learning Systems100.\tMathematical formulation of the inductive learning problem101.\tConcept Learning102.\tConcept Learning as Search103.\tAlgorithm to Find a Maximally-Specific Hypothesis104.\tCandidate Elimination Algorithm105.\tThe Candidate-Elimination Algorithm106.\tDecision Tree Construction107.\tSplitting Functions108.\tDecision Tree Pruning109.\tNeural Networks110.\tArtificial Neural Networks111.\tPerceptron112.\tPerceptron Learning113.\tMulti-Layer Perceptrons114.\tBack-Propagation Algorithm115.\tStatistical learningAll topics not listed here because of character limit set by Play Store",
