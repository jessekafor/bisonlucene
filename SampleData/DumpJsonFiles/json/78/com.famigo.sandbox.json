Its now not opening and saying \\'Time\\'s Up! Ask your parents to add more play time!\\' Then requesting $5.05 on my Tablet.  So much for remaining free for people who had it before 24/8.  It needed setting up each time I opened it on the tablet. Does it think im a new user even though it was downloaded a month ago? Same google play account.",
