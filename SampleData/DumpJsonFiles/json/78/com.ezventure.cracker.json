They have fuses, and are wrapped in a heavy paper casing to contain the explosive compound. Firecrackers, along with fireworks, originated in China.â»ãContents of firecrackersãFirecrackers are generally made of cardboard or plastic, with flash powder or black powder as the propellant. This is not always the case, however. Anything from match heads to lighter fluid have been used successfully in making firecrackers. The key to loud firecrackers, however, although in part lying in the propellant substance, is pressure. The entire firecracker must be very tightly packed in order for it to work best. Flash powder does not need to be packed tightly, however.â»ãCultureãFirecrackers are commonly used in celebration of holidays or festivals, such as Chinese New Year, Halloween, Independence Day (also known as the 4th of July) in the United States of America, Diwali in India, Tihar in Nepal, Day of Ashura in Morocco, Guy Fawkes Night or bonfire night in the United Kingdom, Skyfest in Ireland, Bastille day in France, and Spanish Fallas, in almost every cultural festival of Sri Lanka (e.g. Sri Lankan new year), and New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, Purim in Israel and especially the celebration of Chinese New Year by Chinese communities around the world.â»ãLegality of firecrackersãFirecrackers, as well as other types of explosives, are subject to various laws in many countries, although firecrackers themselves are not usually considered illegal contraband material. It is usually the manufacture, sale, storage, and use of firecrackers that are subject to laws including safety requirements for manufacture, the requirement of a permit to sell or store, or restrictions on the use of firecrackers.â»ãChinese zodiacãThe ShÄngxiÃ o (Chinese: çè) also known in English as the Chinese Zodiac is a systematic plan of future action, that relates each year to animal and its reputed attributes, according to a 12-year mathematical cycle. It has wide currency in several East Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan, and variants are found in Central Asia.â  No 6.
