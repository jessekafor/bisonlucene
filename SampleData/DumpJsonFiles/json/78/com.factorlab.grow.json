    "description": "FactorLab ensures that your sales strategy is successfully and consistently executed in the field and across the sales floor. Grow by FactorLab makes capturing buyer feedback and prioritizing your warmest opportunities faster and easier than ever before. Youâll eliminate wasted sales activity and unpredictable pipelines and forecasts by giving your sales team tools to more accurately capture buyer behavior, identify true purchase intent, and focus precisely on the deals that are ready to move forward and close. The result is more effective sales teams at the point of customer contact, more focused sales coaching opportunities for managers, and sales forecasts that actually come true. The Grow application uses your Android device to capture more relevant, direct indicators (as defined by you and your team) about purchase intent. Information collected after customer calls (in less than 60 seconds) helps you pinpoint answers to critical questions like: -Is this prospect likely to close? -Am I focusing on the right prospects? -What specific actions should I take to close more sales this quarter? Want to know exactly which prospects in your pipeline â today and moving forward â are going to close? Stop wasting time on business that isnât going anywhere, and focus your time on a more accurate, predictable pipeline.
