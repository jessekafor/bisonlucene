        "comment": "Decided to check if there was a HIFF app and was surprised to find one that just came out. Quite nice to see the full listing. Saving movies you want to watch is cool. You can buy tickets. Only thing I found missing was the lack of director, producer, etc details on listings. Still well done, nice Interface and quick browsing.",
