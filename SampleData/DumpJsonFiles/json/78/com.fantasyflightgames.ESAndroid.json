Elder Sign: Omens places you in control of up to four intrepid investigators, as they fight to keep all-powerful Ancient Ones from invading our world through a museumâs arcane exhibits! *Build a team of unique investigators* *Explore an ever-changing museum* *Face challenging arcane tasks* *Save the world from absolute destruction**Expand the horror with two exciting in-app purchases*Can you stand against the impending arrival of a malevolent Ancient One? While Elder Sign: Omens brilliantly conveys the spirit of the Elder Sign dice game, a few noteworthy differences were adopted to optimize the mobile play experience: -A limited number of available Ancient Ones streamlines the game play experience while offering adjustable levels of difficulty. Face Yig in normal mode, Azathoth or Tsathoggua in hard mode, or Cthulhu or Ithaqua in very hard mode (in-app purchases required to face Cthulhu and Ithaqua).-A number of subtle changes increase the peril of defending humanity. For example, the random negative effects drawn every midnight are more challenging, and the frequency of âno effectâ results has been decreased. Monsters have likewise been altered to make them more difficult. -Finally, there are no Ally cards in Elder Sign: Omens, which further streamlines play while increasing the overall challenge.",

There should be an easier way to see what all the characters have,  instead of flipping through all their inventories individually.  That and some characters behave differently than the board game without any prior notice. Samsung Note 10.1",

        "comment": "I recently bought the boardgame version after watching Wil Wheaton\\'s Table Top on YouTube. Played a game the first night and stumbled my way through it, not really grasping the game mechanics all that well. An insert with the game advertised the ap, which I promptly bought. The best purchase I could have made, as the ap was able to clarify the mechanics I was having some problems with, making the second time with the board game easier. The ap continues to clarify the game rules forrme, so I know the next time I play the board game I will have no problems at all. The ap is very challenging, having only managed to beat one game so far, but the defeats only keep me wanting to play. Purchasing the expansions is definitely a plus, as they add more investigators to the mix, and some multi-tiered adventures as well. All in all, a great ap, and I look forward to either more expansions or further aps from this company.",
