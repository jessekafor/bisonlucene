I really think you guys should consider adding a way to earn coins in the game cause that would be so much better and you would make a lot more people happier with the app! You should also add more good bud to this app and smoke a bowl. Thanks",

I paid for the app and bought all the extras I paid for the 1,000 coins and was able to buy everything. And for these who think it\\'s greedy I don\\'t think let me explain. See it takes money to develop these extras and that money has to come from somewhere. Now I think paying is fine until you cross the line where your app starts to be over 3 bucks per extra so if I paid over 10 bucks I\\'d be mad too.",

It takes up unneeded time for that. I can do it in 21sec. But if those stupid pop up directions did not hold you up. I could do it even faster. Please fix this and it will be 5 stars.",

The latest update adds loads of variety ; yes there are micro transactions but for \\302\\2430.75 you can get like 3 new papers, lighters and 1 or 2 new grinders so its  a great deal. Epic game  oh and its fun to see how much $ worth of weed you\\'ve smoked in the stats page :)",
