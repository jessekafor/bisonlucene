        "comment": "I am a big fan of the boardgame version of this, which is how I was originally introduced to the game. It is easy enough to explain to even young children, but once you get the hang of how the game works can become quite strategic. My main issue with the physical game was that it took nearly as long to set up the fish tiles as it would to play the game - that lone issue with it has been solved, making this a nearly perfect play experience for all. Played on a Nook HD+.",
