Although it seems to be cold out there, the island seems to be full of live, carrying a huge city on top. Spot lights are searching for something on the surface of the water, maybe it's a small boat that they are looking for. Engines are glowing rythmically, as if the island is about to fly away. Judging by the clouds running fast on the sky, wind must be very strong. From time to time a sentry ship passes by, guarding the surroundings of the island. And everything under the cold light of a lonely moon. Where is that land? Might be right on Your smartphone's/tablet's homescreen.Hope You'll enjoy it!",
