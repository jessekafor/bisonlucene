    "description": "This unique application is for all students across the world. It covers 114 topics of Graph Theory in detail. These 114 topics are divided in 4 units.Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.This USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from anywhere they like.Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tIntroduction to Graphs2.\tDirected and Undirected Graph3.\tBasic Terminologies of Graphs4.\tVertices5.\tThe Handshaking Lemma6.\tTypes of Graphs7.\tN-cube8.\tSubgraphs9.\tGraph Isomorphism10.\tOperations of Graphs11.\tThe Problem of Ramsay12.\tConnected and Disconnected Graph13.\tWalks Paths and Circuits14.\tEulerial Graphs15.\tFluery's Algorithm16.\tHamiltonian Graphs17.\tDirac's Theorem18.\tOre's Theorem19.\tProblem of seating arrangement20.\tTravelling Salesman Problem21.\tKonigsberg's Bridge Problem22.\tRepresentation of Graphs23.\tCombinatorial and Geometric Graphs24.\tPlaner Graphs25.\tKuratowaski's Graph26.\tHomeomorphic Graphs27.\tRegion 28.\tSubdivision Graphs and Inner vertex Sets29.\tOuter Planer Graph 30.\tBipertite Graph31.\tEuler's Theorem32.\tThree utility problem33.\tKuratowskiâs Theorem34.\tDetection of Planarity of a Graph 35.\tDual of a Planer Graph36.\tGraph Coloring37.\tChromatic Polynomial38.\tDecomposition theorem39.\tScheduling Final Exams40.\tFrequency assignments and Index registers41.\tColour Problem42.\tIntroduction to Tree43.\tSpanning Tree44.\tRooted Tree45.\tBinary Tree46.\tTraversing Binary Trees47.\tCounting Tree48.\tTree Traversal49.\tComplete Binary Tree50.\tInfix, Prefix and Postfix Notation of an Arithmatic Operation51.\tBinary Search Tree52.\tStorage Representation of Binary Tree53.\tAlgorithm for Constructing Spanning Trees54.\tTrees and Sorting55.\tWeighted Tree and Prefix Codes56.\tHuffman Code57.\tMore Application of Graph58.\tShortest Path Algorithm59.\tDijkstra Algorithm60.\tMinimal Spanning Tree61.\tPrimâs algorithm62.\tThe labeling algorithm63.\tReachability, Distance and diameter, Cut vertex, cut set and bridge64.\tTransport Networks65.\tMax-Flow Min-Cut Theorem66.\tMatching Theory67.\tHall's Marriage Theorem68.\tCut Vertex69.\tIntroduction to Matroids and Transversal Theory70.\tTypes of Matroid71.\tTransversal Theory 72.\tCut Set73.\tTypes of Enumeration74.\tLabeled Graph 75.\tCounting Labeled tree76.\tRooted Lebeled Tree77.\tUnlebeled Tree78.\tCentroid79.\tPermutation80.\tPermutation Group81.\tEquivalance classes of Function82.\tGroup 83.\tSymmetric Graph 84.\tCoverings85.\tVertex Covering86.\tLines and Points in graphs87.\tPartitions and Factorization88.\tArboricity of Graphs89.\tDigraphs90.\tOrientation of a graph 91.\tEdges and Vertex92.\tTypes of Digraphs93.\tConnected Digraphs94.\tCondensation, Reachability and Oreintable Graph95.\tArborescence 96.\tEuler Digraph97.\tHand Shaking Dilemma and Directed Walk path and Circuit98.\tSemi walk paths and Circuits and Tournaments99.\tIncident, Circuit and Adjacency Matrix of Digraph 100.\tNullity of a Matrix101.\tChromatic number102.\tCalculating a Chromatic number103.\tBrooks Theorem104.\tBrooks Theorem105.\tMatrix Representation of Graphs106.\tCut Matrix107.\tCircuit Matrix108.\tMatrices over GF(2) and Vector Spaces of Graphs109.\tIntroduction to Graph Coloring110.\tPlanar Graphs111.\tEulerâs formula112.\tKruskalâs algorithm113.\tHeuristic algorithm for an upper bound114.\tHeuristic algorithm for an lower bound",
