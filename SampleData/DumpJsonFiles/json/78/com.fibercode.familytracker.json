That allows you to share or archive this information.*** The Pro Features are optional and require an in app purchase in order to get activated! ***IF YOU NEED HELP, PLEASE CONTACT OUR SUPPORT AT android@logsat.com. WE REPLY PROMPTLY!FamilyTracker allows you to track your children, wife, husband and fiancÃ©e. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their Android or iOS devices with them.So how does this work?Simple. Install Family Tracker on the device you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own device to locate your family member.Each device with FamilyTracker installed has the option to automatically update its location at regular intervals (from every 1 min. to every 1 hour). You can adjust this under the \"Settings\" tab. The automatic feature can be turned on/off by the user.Whether the user has their automatic tracking service disabled or not you can always force an update of their location at any time.Any time you would like to see the current location of a device you can \"ping\" it, which will send a tracking notification to the user.There are 2 ways to set up tracking a phone with our application:1. Having the application installed on both phones- yours and the person you want to track.2. Install the Family Tracker application only on the phone you want to track and then use our website to track it, force location updates and send free messages.Family Tracker does not need to know your phone's cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. It sends free Push Notifications to the device being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the device being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi.*** Requires Android OS version 2.2 and up ***",

The option to send a text that overrides the silent mode is a great bonus for us, and I didn\\'t know it was an option!  The only thing that would make it better is single hand zoom, as used in the Google Maps app",

        "title": "Live Tracking is Good - Pro Features, Not So Much",
        "comment": "The live tracking is good. I use the app so that my family can see where I am when I go on my motorcycle cruises. It is comforting to know that if something untoward should happen to me while out on a ride and I did not return home when expected, my family could pass on location information to emergency responders.  I subscribed to, but quickly cancelled Pro Features. Many of my bike rides take me on distances of over 200 miles,  I thought it would be a good idea to leave a \\\"breadcrumb\\\" history on each ride. This would help in the event of an emergency.  I quickly found out that this feature of Family Tracker is of no use to me because there is no way for me to clear the breadcrumb history before I embark on a ride.  Because I ride often, the history map which displays blue \\\"marker pins\\\" for each point that is reported quickly filled up with hundreds of pins showing hundreds of positions where I had been tracked over a period of a few days.  One weekends worth of riding was enough to crowd the history map with so many marker pins that the history map was useless.  The ability to clear breadcrumb history as needed would have earned you 5 stars!",

The 15 minute incase only applies to the Android market, after this period you will not be able to get a refund.If you have issues with the refund, you can contact Apple and ask them directly for a refund and maybe they can help you out with your issue.  Keep in mind that we do not have any control over the purchases as we do not handle the purchases made on iTunes.   The only way for the app to work is to have internet and all the apps on the market use internet to report its position, there is no app that can do so without internet. I can help you with any issue with this, but unfortunately there is no way it can work out without internet.  Please let us know if you have any other comments or have any questions regarding on how the app works.  Kind regards, Gabo \\342\\200\\223 Family Tracker support\\\"",

        "comment": "for a family tracker it should have the ability to activate/ deactivate the gprs of the family member by sms. or temporarily activate gprs only to refresh the location. otherwise it is a friend locator app just like google maps app. It gets the data by 3G or WiFi, that means that if data connection is not available or turned off, you are not able to lokate your kid. The location should be determined by gprs alone if there is no data connectivity available. For my self it shows my family members still at home until they retourn because at school they are not allowed to connect to WiFi and having 3G on at all times makes it expencive. It works fine otherwise it does not consumes much battery and it does not stress the user, no popups. Perfect in this regard better than google app. But still it is not a family traker but a friend traker for as long it is conserned about the privacy rights. My family does not mind knowing where they are this is how I got permition to install it on their phones. and it should send stealth mesages to temporarily activate gprs or tourn on then off the gprs every hour for about 3 minutes just to refresh the location.",
