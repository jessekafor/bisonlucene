Granted this can be changed inside the app, but that\\'s kind of insulting.  There\\'s no reason this app should not run in landscape mode.. make it 10 inch tablet friendly.  The calendar options okay, but can definitely be expanded. I\\'m not really bothered by the checking status updates, as that would more than likely use the phone data plan.  All around this is a nice app.",
