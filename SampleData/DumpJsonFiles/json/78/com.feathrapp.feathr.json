    "description": "Born from the idiom: \"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Feathr aims to help you grow your flock of professional contacts by helping you automate your follow-up workflow. When you meet someone, you can connect, follow, email, and save them to your contacts â removing the need for business cards and the hassle for follow-up later. Feathr also lets you keep track of the people you meet, and reminds you when you don't follow up with them.",

        "comment": "Good start guys, but some suggestions:  Is there a way to notify me if there are feathr users nearby? That would be a great way to remind me to use it instead of exchanging business cards.   Also it would be cool if it worked similar to bump, so I could exchange cards without having to search for the other person.",
