This will improve the ease of use.Clean Feature:* Allocates very large memory during cleaning, and releases allocated memory.* The system will kill most of running apps and services at a time. So the memory fragmentation can expect to improve.* The services(widgets) is automatically started again by the system.* The resident apps and Home app to back immediately after startup with less memory usage.The timing of use:* when you feel that system is slower.* after use for a long time.* after you have used the resident apps which is not killed the task killer.How to use:1. Press the clean button and begin cleaning immediately.2. After cleaning, kill unused services by task killer if using or kill it from process list (Android 2.1 and below).Requirements:* Android 1.6 or higherOperation check:* Emulator(Android 1.6/2.x/3.x/4.0/4.1)* HTC Magic, Xperia X10, REGZA Phone T-01C, Galaxy S2 LTE, Galaxy NexusPermission:* NOT require Storage(WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) permission  This app doesn't modify/delete SD card contents.",
