    "description": "EventBoard is the free application that makes attending conferences a breeze. EventBoard allows you to view and search for conference sessions by name, speaker, tracks, time slot, and keyword. EventBoard also provides access to other valuable conference resources, such as maps, floor plans, news feeds, and conference web pages. EventBoard's push notifications can alert you to late breaking conference or schedule changes. Once a conference catalog is downloaded, the information is stored locally on the device, allowing EventBoard to help you plan your session attendance even when network access is not available. EventBoard also allows users to mark favorite sessions, plan attendance, and rate attended sessions. Each conference is branded differently to portray it's unique look and feel. For more details, visit the EventBoard site at http://eventboardmobile.falafel.com",

        "comment": "Falafel addresses issues with specific conference catalogs very responsively. The app itself is a functional way to view a conference catalog by time slot or speaker name and to select your agenda. The app also shows conference news and information and links to conference resources (such as to the conference website and to the conference location in Google Maps). I have two main issues: 1) Accessing a conference might trigger notifications that can\\'t be turned off. I sometimes got several notifications a day after accessing a completed conference. 2) The user account feature is not explained within the app, and most users would be better off without an account. The only purpose of the account seems to be to allow you to access your agenda on multiple devices. The app doesn\\'t keep a local copy of your agenda on your device if you use an account. If your device loses access to the Internet, you can\\'t see your agenda. (For example, if you choose your agenda at home and then fly to the conference, you can\\'t see your agenda while you\\'re on the plane.) The agenda is stored locally if you don\\'t use an account, so if you don\\'t use multiple devices, you\\'re better off without an account.",

        "title": "Extremely frustrating bugs",
        "comment": "After using this app during AnDevCon IV, it\\'s painfully clear that it needs a complete overhaul. There are several usability issues that make the app difficult to use and sometimes pretty unreliable. The interface is frustrating to use and very messy.  It appears that EventBoard doesn\\'t cache data reliably (and some data doesn\\'t seem to be cached at all). Many conferences are notorious for having slow, limited or only partially functioning Wi-Fi. Combined with the need to quickly look at a scheduled agenda means waiting a very long time for data to load. The \\'All\\' view (and the By Time and By Track views, too) doesn\\'t show any markers to indicate which sessions you\\'ve marked to attend, a feature that is present in the iOS version.  The interface should also be redesigned to move conference info out of the Android system menu into the main screen. Ideally, they should be using the action bar, but that\\'s probably aiming too high.",

        "comment": "As David has already said, it would be much better if it could be configured to default to a particular conference. Also the view that My Agenda etc give is very basic - it would be much more user-friendly if a grid-style layout (for example similar to the Sky+ App) was used.  Finally it would also be better if the agenda summary view showed end time as well as start time (in the current layout). Many conferences do have overlapping sessions so the end time is important - clearly with a grid-style layout this might be more obvious anyway.  Since I haven\\'t yet attended the conference I have yet to find out how easy it is for the organisers to update the agenda dynamically and how that shows up...!",
