    "description": "This unique application is for all students across the world. It covers 86 topics of Quality Control in detail. These 86 topics are divided in 5 units.Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.This USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from anywhere they like.Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tQuality Improvement and Statistics2.\tStatistical Quality and Process Control3.\tControl Charts4.\tCharts for Variable such as (X,R charts)5.\tCharts for Attributes such as (P,C charts)6.\tUse of Control Charts7.\tProcess Capability Analysis8.\tPrinciple of acceptance sampling9.\tProducerâs and consumerâs risk and Average outgoing quality10.\tSampling Error11.\tSingle Sampling Plan12.\tSampling Plans13.\tDouble Sampling Plan14.\tSequential Sampling Plan15.\tAcceptance sampling attributes16.\tAcceptance sampling by variable17.\tDifference between attribute and variable sampling plans18.\tIntroduction to Reliability19.\tProduct Life Cycle Curve or Bath tub curve20.\tRelationship between the failure rate and the mean time between failures21.\tSystems Reliability (Series & Parallel System)22.\tImplications for Design23.\tRedundancy in Reliability24.\tReliability based design25.\tIntroduction of Value Analysis26.\tDefining Cost and Value27.\tThe Focus of Value Analysis28.\tUse of  Value Analysis (Within the business & Market induced Reasons)29.\tTypes Of Value Analysis30.\tRelated Tools and Techniques of Value Analysis31.\tApplication of Value Analysis32.\tBasic Concept of TQM 33.\tDifference Between Quality Assurance And Quality Control34.\tImplementation of TQM 35.\tIntroduction of Implementation of TQM 36.\tQuality Assurance in TQM37.\tQuality Control points- Introduction38.\tQuality Management in TQM39.\tIntroduction to Total Quality Management40.\tHistorical evolution of Total Quality Management41.\tZero Defects in TQM42.\tIntroduction to Taguchi method43.\tHistory of Six Sigma44.\tDefination of Six Sigma45.\tConcept of Sig Sigma46.\tIntroduction of ISO 900047.\tISO 9000 Standard Series48.\tHistorical Background: The Concept of Quality Circle49.\tIntroduction of Quality Circle50.\tOrganizational Structure of Quality Circle51.\tMaterial Quality Control52.\t Diagnostic Techniques Introduction53.\tThomson, Rayleigh and Raman scattering54.\tDiode laser absorption55.\t(Ta)LIF56.\tAbsolute intensities of spectral lines57.\tSpectral Line Broadening58.\tContinuum radiation and Power Interruption59.\tIntroduction to Condition Monitoring60.\tIntroduction to Condition Monitoring Techniques61.\tMean Time Between Failures (MTBF)62.\tObjectives of Inspection and types of Inspection63.\tStages of Inspection64.\tInspection Procedures65.\tMethods of Inspection and its Drawbacks 66.\tIntroduction of Quality and Quality Control67.\tQuality Characteristics68.\tTotal Quality Control69.\tProcess capability Introduction70.\tDefinitions and Process Capability Study Steps71.\tProcess Capability and Calculating Process Capability Indices72.\tAccuracy and Precision73.\tTypes of Fits74.\tTypes of Tolerances75.\tStandard Tolerances76.\tSelection of Fits77.\tSystems of Fit (Hole and Shaft Basis)78.\tLimits 79.\tNon Destructive Testing (NDT)80.\tNon destructive Evaluation (NDE) Techniques81.\tTypes of Gauges82.\tInterchangeability Introduction83.\tTypes of Interchangeability84.\tStandardisation and its Types85.\tAccuracy versus Precision86.\tDesign for MaintainabilityAll topics are not listed because of character limitations set by the Play Store.",
