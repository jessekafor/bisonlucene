When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a high heel; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. High heels tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender legs. High heels come in a wide variety of styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (court shoe), block, tapered, blade, and wedge.According to high-fashion shoe websites like Jimmy Choo and Gucci, a \"low heel\" is considered less than 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters), while heels between 2.5 and 3.5 inches (6.4 and 8.9 cm) are considered \"mid heels\", and anything over that is considered a \"high heel\". The apparel industry would appear to take a simpler view; the term \"high heels\" covers heels ranging from 2 to 5 inches. Extremely high-heeled shoes, such as those exceeding 6 inches, strictly speaking, are no longer considered apparel but rather something akin to \"jewelery for the feet\". They are worn for display or the enjoyment of the wearer.Although high heels are now usually worn only by girls and women, there are shoe designs worn by both genders that have elevated heels, including cowboy boots and Cuban heels. In previous ages, men also wore high heels.Attentionï¼Application is free,it does not promote paid version of this app,the only way to support future development is to include ads.
