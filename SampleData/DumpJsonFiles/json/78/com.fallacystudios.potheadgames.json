    "description": "This fun new app features a whole bunch of party games to give you entertainment while you are getting stoned on some good weed. There are games for both someone flying solo and for the group of friends. Don't smoke your marijuana the normal way... entertain yourself while you do!**Note these are not actual video games. These are party games for anywhere from 1 to many players to give you an activity to do to get high**Backgrounds that allow you to trip out while you play the games.Games such as:*Stoner Says: Game similar to simon says, but you can guess what the outcome of this game is.*Kings Joint: Ever played Kings Cup? Well this game is similar, but gets you high rather than drunk.*Trippy: Simply a way to trip out while you are taking hits. Stare closely!Currently this version features 10 games. And more are coming with future updates. These current games will also be modified to add content and make them even more fun.If you have any ideas or tasks/objectives that you think would be a great addition to these games feel free to shoot me an email at FALLACYSTUDIOS@GMAIL.COMIf you experience any problems at all or are not liking the app please send me an email rather than give bad ratings. I will do my best to resolve any issues.Happy Toking!Special Thanks to http://trippypsychart.blogspot.com/ for the public domain background art.TAGS: smoke, weed, bud, marijuana, stoner, stoners, handbook, toke, high, blunt, joint, trip, trippy, fun, game, games, party, baked(c)2011 All Rights Reserved.
