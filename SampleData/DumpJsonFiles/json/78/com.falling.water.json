    "description": "Your goal in Falling Water is to get water flowing from the faucet(s) into the cup(s) in each level.Tap the red dot to turn the flow of water on/off and draw on the screen with your finger to place concrete. Switch between drawing and erasing using the button in the top left corner of the screen. To clear the screen of all concrete press the button in the upper right corner.If your phone is fast enough, pressing the slower/faster button will speed up the water to make for less waiting. Also note that if you leave the level using either the Back or Home button you will lose your progress on that level. If you get tired of the main levels or just want to relax then try Free Style!Falling Water is similar to the game Falling Sand and both owe their logic to John Conwayâââs Game of Life (1970) the best known example of cellular automation. Falling Water was designed and programmed by Arthur Haugh.Got an idea for a level? Draw it out and e-mail it to us!If you like Mighty Wind's first game, support us by clicking the in-game ads.",

        "comment": "I like the concept, but I l\\'m not sure it works on some of the larger phones, simply because of scaling. Level 5\\'s layout doesn\\'t seem to work on my Galaxy S3, because the cap on the cup sort of intersects where the water should go, and prevents one pixel from filling, so I cannot win the level.",

        "comment": "Decent idea but the levels are easy and boring. Waiting for minutes at a time for the water to fill up enough so it overflows into the containers on the upwards levels made me switch it off and uninstall.   Drawing often doesn\\'t work and leaves gaps that need replacing, and it becomes frustrating.   To the developer and other downloaders: Take a look at \\\"Where\\'s my Water\\\" for a good implementation of this idea. The developer also needs to take a look at good UI design and interaction too.",
