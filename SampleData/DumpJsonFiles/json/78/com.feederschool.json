The Feeder School app ranks high schools that are best at sending students to top colleges: Berkeley, Stanford, USC, Rice, UT Austin, UCLA and many more.High school data collected in the app includes % of class admitted, 3 year total, average SAT, student-to-teacher ratio, college readiness, etc. These data are aggregated from the most up-to-date publicly available data sources including Department of Education and university databases, surveys, research publications, and online sources. With this app, you can check Wikipedia entry of the high school, look up its Yelp rating and checkout Youtube videos and Flickr photos related the school.
