The kids would be delighted with the appearance of the moving colorful objects and animals. You might want to know first whatâs in store for you.â Alphabets and Animations. Keep sliding and tapping the ABC alphabet letters to watch out what comes next. We have animated different characters and objects to make sure that your pre-schoolers play around and spend a quality time learning with fun.â We make it work with colors and HD images. We make it easier for you to teach ABCs to your pre-school aged child with attractive HD images and filling them with catchy colors.â Uniqueness is a better way to educate This educational app is like a word game for the children, unlike the other traditionally designed process of educating kids. We believe in quality distraction-free learning while keeping the toddlers engaged in fun filled activities. We skillfully design our apps in a way that matches the capabilities of the pre-school kid and are child-friendly.You might be wondering about:â How would my child learn ABC?â The repeated tap of various alphabets will make your child familiar with the letters.â How can I help my child to learn through this app?â You can ask him to tap a specific letter so that he can get to know the individual identity of alphabets and their names. Ask your kid to see what appears on screen with the tap of that alphabet. He would be enchanted to view his favorite things coming up.â What age group does it focus?â This app is specially tailored for the pre-school kids keeping in mind their mental abilities and to prepare them for school. We aim at assisting the parents to guide their child in reading and learning.â What else would be coming next?â We will soon be adding sounds of different objects. Though the pronunciation and phonics is totally a different field of education but we might plan to add it here in this app in future for your convenience. We want to provide you everything in one single app.â You can avail it on your phones as well as on your tablets.",
