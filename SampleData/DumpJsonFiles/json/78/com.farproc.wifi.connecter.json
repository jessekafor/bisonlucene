It\\'s a very handy addon to connect to specific networks when they share the same SSID (for example FON_ZON_FREE_INTERNET). Now I\\'m able to select which AP under the same SSID has the best signal and connect to it. It saved me a lot of time. Thank you team! :)",

Also, my phone no longer connects to wifi, locks up when going to wireless settings, and constantly restarts the GUI. CPU is 100% all of the time. I removed this as well as wifi analyzer and things are still broken. This app must have done something to the wireless settings. Finally got an opportunity to install the library and wifi analyzer from the Play website. I went into Wifi Analyzer and it was locking up. I closed it and made sure it was killed. From the Play website, I removed Wifi Connecter library. Then, I removed the Wifi Analyzer. My phone immediately locked up afterword. I force rebooted phone (hold power down for long time). Then, when it came back up, I could turn off the wireless again and my phone is cooling down. This was BAD! If I saw that others had the same thing I\\'d think it malware but it seems like I\\'m the only one...",
