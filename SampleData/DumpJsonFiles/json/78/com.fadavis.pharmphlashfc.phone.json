        "comment": "This is not a bad app, but it needs a search.  I am taking pharmacotherapeutics, and the first test is not going to cover all of the flash card. I dont want to go threw 400 cards one by one to bookmark lets say 40 cards for the first test. Update: I now give it 5 stars. I emailed the developer about the search option and in about a week an update came out with it. Great app thank you.",
