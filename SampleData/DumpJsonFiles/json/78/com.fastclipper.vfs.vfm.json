It doesn't deal with media file internals.Virtual Film doesn't exist as a physical media file. That's why it's called \"virtual\". It weights little and loads fast.It is just a script in the simple XML file format that controls the customized Android media player. It just tells the media player, in what sequence to playback fragments of videos and photos and adds background music. And, yes... you cannot upload the finished product to YouTube.Please, find more details, screenshots, videos, feature comparison and positive customer raves on the developer's web site.
