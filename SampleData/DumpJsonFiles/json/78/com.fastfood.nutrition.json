If I am trying to watch my sodium, etc., I want to know which foods I should avoid, the sort ability would allow us to click on each category and sort the foods that way.  2. Can you please add the RDA % info to both the food items as well as the tally. I think that if people see how much fat, etc. there is compared to RDA % then people might make healthier choices.",
