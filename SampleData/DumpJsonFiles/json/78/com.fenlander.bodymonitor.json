I\\'m tracking lots of parameters bp, pulse, exercise type, time I took the readings, muscle mass, water content etc etc and it would be fabulous if you could input these to the main program itself rather than having to record all these values as a long list of notes.  It\\'s still a very useful bit of kit though so well done guys :-)",
