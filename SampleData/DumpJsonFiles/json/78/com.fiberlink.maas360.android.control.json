        "comment": "I\\'m going to break the myths for those who seem to be confused about this app. -- 1. The app does not allow IT to see anything personal, beyond knowing the applications installed, and in all honesty, none of us care. 2. Location data, yes, it can see, though again, 99% of companies will never use it. It\\'s disabled on our account. Though the upside is that the user can track their phone in the case they lose it. Though a better tracking software is Cerberus. Look it up. 3. Yes the app can wipe your device, but so can your phone being connected to 99% of corporate servers. It\\'s built into exchange. MaaS gives the ability to wipe ONLY corporate email. Albeit, it only works when used on Motos and newer Samsungs. 4. Battery life can range depending on the settings the IT dept sets. Ours are set to sync every 4 hours. Default is 15 minutes.  Bottom line people. Don\\'t assume because you don\\'t understand.  As for dev: Ideally, the things that would make this better. 1. Push ability to get rid of the polling battery drain. 2. Less complicated for EU\\'s. 3. Support auto email and selective wipe on all major devices, Moto, HTC and Samsung. At current, selective isn\\'t supported on HTC.",

This is not meant for the end user, it\\'s meant for the admins.  But what the h*** was the product manager thinking of when forcing the app into the notification bar? As an end user - I don\\'t need to see this app. There is no value what so ever for me to have the app there. I can\\'t remove it, nor make any changes to the app.  If this is a business, stop bugging the end user, or they will soon see to that their company will not use this app anymore.  Thanks, m",
