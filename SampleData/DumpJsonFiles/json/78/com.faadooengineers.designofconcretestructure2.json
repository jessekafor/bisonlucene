    "description": "This unique application is for all students across the world. It covers 70 topics of Design of Concrete Structures II in detail. These 70 topics are divided in 5 units.Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.This USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from anywhere they like.Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tIntroduction2.\tEXPLANATION OF SOME DURABILITY CONCEPTS3.\tGENERAL4.\tBASIC FORMULATION OF DURABILITY DESIGN5.\tDESIGN WITH PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLE WHEN R AND S ARE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED6.\tDURABILITY DESIGN WITH LOG-NORMAL SERVICE LIFE DISTRIBUTION7.\tTHE MEANING OF LIFETIME SAFETY FACTOR8.\tLIFETIME SAFETY FACTORS AS DETERMINED BY STOCHASTIC METHODS9.\tDETERMINATION OF LIFETIME SAFETY FACTORS FOR STRUCTURAL DURABILITY DESIGN10.\tDetermination of lifetime safety factors by the separated safety principle11.\tFORMULATION OF LOAD-BEARING CAPACITY WITH TIME12.\tColumn13.\tBeam14.\tPROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR STRUCTURAL DURABILITY DESIGN15.\tDurability design16.\tFinal design17.\tTYPES OF DURABILITY MODELS18.\tDurability models for some degradation processes19.\tABRASION OF CONCRETE BY ICE20.\tCORROSION OF REINFORCEMENT21.\tInitiation time of corrosion22.\tPropagation period23.\tDURABILITY DESIGN IN THIS DESIGN GUIDE24.\tIntroduction to various Design Philosophies25.\tIntroduction to various Design Philosophies26.\tDesign of Rectangular Singly and Doubly Reinforced Sections by Working Stress Method27.\tAssumptions in Limit State Theory28.\tAssumptions in Limit State Design Method29.\tDesign of Rectangular singly beam by limit state method 30.\tNumericals on Singly Reinforced beam by LSD31.\tDesign of Rectangular Doubly beam by Limit state method 32.\tNumericals on Doubly reinforced beam 33.\tDesign of T and L beams34.\tIS code specifications for designing35.\tFour different cases for designing T and L beams36.\tNumericals on T and L beams37.\tConcrete making materials38.\tProperties of concrete39.\tMix design 40.\tTesting of Concrete41.\tBehaviour of RC beams in shear42.\tDesign of beams in shear43.\tMinimum and Maximum shear reinforcements44.\tCurtailment of tension reinforcements45.\tNumericals on Shear reinforcement46.\tIntroduction to Development length47.\tAnchoring reinforcing bars48.\tFlexure Bond49.\tDesign for combined bending, shear and torsion50.\tRequirement of Reinforcement in combined bending, shear and torsion51.\tNumerical on combined effect of bending , shear and torsion52.\tIntroduction to columns53.\tReinforcement detailing in Columns54.\tAssumptions in the design of columns55.\tMinimum Eccentricity of columns56.\tDesign of Short columns under Axial Load with Uniaxial Bending57.\tDesign of short column under axial compression58.\tCode Procedure for Design of Biaxially Loaded Columns59.\tDesign of Slender columns60.\tIntroduction to slabs61.\tOne way and two way slabs62.\tDesign shear strength and design considerations in slabs63.\tDesign of One way slabs64.\tNumerical on one way slab65.\tDesign shear strength and design considerations in two way slabs66.\tDesign of Two way slabs67.\tDetailing of Reinforcements for two way slabs68.\tNumerical on two way slab69.\tServiceability limit state70.\tFailure mode due to shear",
