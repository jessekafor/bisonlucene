        "comment": "Works perfectly. On my Thunderbolt, when display shuts off, this app ends the call. The display turns off one of 2 ways. First way is if I hit the lock button and I want call to end. Second way is if the display times-out and app accidentally ends call. By increasing the time required for the display to timeout I can stop the accidental end of calls. Go to settings/display to change it. It\\'s a great start to a big problem for some of us so please understand it\\'s limitations and don\\'t be hard on developer.",
