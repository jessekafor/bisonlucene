It originated with Mexican-American communities in the American West as a way to commemorate the cause of freedom and democracy during the first years of the American Civil War and today the date is observed in the United States as a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride. In the state of Puebla, the date is observed to commemorate the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza SeguÃ­n. Note: Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day (which is celebrated on September 16).Tags: may 5th, mexico, party, fiesta, pinata, tequila, may 5, cinco de mayo, 1862, piÃ±ata, The Day of the Battle of Puebla, battle of puebla, mexican, game, birthdays",
