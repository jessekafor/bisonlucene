    "description": "Martian Chess is a digital recreation of Andrew Looney's classic treehouse / icehouse game now on your Android Phones and Tablets!A fun and challenging board game,similar to traditional chess, with a smaller board and much quicker game play. In Martian Chess, pieces on your side of the game board are always yours.This is a two or four player (Tablets only) game, any of which can be players or computers.It's a game of attrition and position, of challenge and strategy.If you play too offensively, your opponent can come right back at you with the piece you attacked him, for once you take their piece, your piece becomes theirs! But if you're too defensive your opponent can corner you. You must find the right balance.We hope you'll love and enjoy Martian Chess, please rate and review, and send us any feedback you have so we can make it better for you!",

        "comment": "Computer gets stuck in a loop, endlessly repeating the same moves. Non tablets can only play the two player game, no for player games for phones. There needs to be better no repeat rules. Also buggy, sometimes legal moves are disallowed; in a two player game, drones cannot move from d7 to d8. This should always be a legal move. I\\'d give it more stars of they fix those bugs.",
