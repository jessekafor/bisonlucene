    "description": "SafeCamera is a camera application that uses the military grade encryption (AES 256) to encrypt your photos on the fly to ensure they are secure, are safely stored and hidden against third party invaders, even if you lose your device and it gets in hands of professional hackers. Securely hide your photos, so that no one except you can access them. SafeCamera has it's own camera that ensures 100% secure storage of the photos.Key features:  â¢Take photos that will be instantly on the fly encrypted and thus never be visible to any application or person until you open it with SafeCamera providing your master password.  â¢Gallery to browse your encrypted photos  â¢Camera with flash and timer for taking self shots  â¢Import existing photos/files to SafeCamera encrypting also filenames and delete original files  â¢Share encrypted photos ether encrypted with same password, other password or decrypted  â¢Import encrypted files from other SafeCamera instance  â¢Encryption with state of the art algorithms and implementation schemes that are proven to be 100% secure by governmental and military organizations.We have thought of everything! Did you know that once any info is written into the memory and then deleted or even overwritten with another file, it is still possible to restore it? SafeCamera never writes your unencrypted photos into your phoneâs SD card. The photo is encrypted on the fly right after it is taken and only then is written to your SD card.Do you have files that you would like to keep safe? Just import them into Safe Cameraâs domain and they will be safe. Although SafeCamera is mainly for handling photos, you can also import and keep safely any other file types.Want to share an encrypted photo with someone? Send the photo(s) either encrypted with your current password or re-encrypted with a different password. Then just tell the encryption password to your friend and he/she will be able to import it into his/her copy of SafeCamera.SafeCamera uses AES 256 bit encryption, which is approved by NSA for keeping top secret files. SafeCamera derives encryption/decryption key using PBKDF#2 algorithm using more than 2000 iterations.See detailed technical specifications on official website http://www.safecamera.org/Comming soon:1. Desktop version of SafeCamera. Decrypt and view your photos on your PC.2. Record and play videos with SafeCamera.3. Securely share your file(s) without need to pass the password to the person you are sharing with.Description of permissions:WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - For reading and writing encrypted and/or plain files from SD card CAMERA - For taking photosWAKE_LOCK - For keeping screen on while making long operationsKeywords: security, safe, camera, photos, hide, cam, secure, encrypt, aes256, pictures, encryption, aes, hide photos, encrypt photos, hide photos, hide pictures, secure vault, hide photosPlease report any bugs to support@safecamera.org",
