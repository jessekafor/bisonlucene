    "description": "This unique application is for all students across the world. It covers 135 topics of Water resources engineering in detail. These 135 topics are divided in 5 units.Each topic is around 600 words and is complete with diagrams, equations and other forms of graphical representations along with simple text explaining the concept in detail.This USP of this application is \"ultra-portability\". Students can access the content on-the-go from anywhere they like.Basically, each topic is like a detailed flash card and will make the lives of students simpler and easier.Some of topics Covered in this application are:1.\tEnvironmental concerns and recreational development in relation to public health2.\tThe concept of drought3.\tThe Ground-Water Component of Stream flow4.\tEffects on crop yields in hydro-economic modeling5.\tSiting and sizing the components of a regional wastewater system6.\tEvaluation of the surface water quality7.\tThree applications of dams in Nepal, Malaysia, and Turkey8.\tControl mosquitoes in fresh water9.\tEnvironmental concerns and recreational development10.\tEnvironmental indicators of healthy water resources11.\tFAO policy and strategy on food security and water development12.\tHealth opportunities in water resources development13.\tHealth opportunity assessment in water resource development14.\tIntroduction of Reservoirs15.\tMethods of assessing impacts and quality chemical, physical , biological16.\tPrinciples of environmental and health impact assessment17.\tSafe management of the Ross River dam18.\tSocioeconomic and health impacts of water resources development19.\tThe effect of dam construction20.\tWater resources development and health21.\tWater resources development22.\tUrban water resource problems in vector-borne disease with special reference23.\tHYDRAULIC, HYDROLOGIC AND HYDROGEOLOGIC APPROACHES24.\tSurface Water25.\tDROUGHT AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT26.\tRigid armour27.\tThe Hydrological Cycle28.\tRainfall Measurements29.\tInfiltration Testing30.\tPrecipitation31.\tEVAPOTRANSPIRATION SYSTEMS32.\tArtificial wetlands33.\tSafe management of the Ross River dam34.\tIntroduction to Integration of water resources modeling35.\tReservoir operation modeling36.\tIntegrated water management systems description37.\tConcepts for Planning Water Resources Development38.\tData requirement for hydropower generation project39.\tDesign Flood Estimation40.\tGuidelines for drinking and irrigation water projects41.\tInternational indicators for comparing water resources potential42.\tManagement strategies for excess and deficit water imbalances43.\tNational Policy for Water Resources Development44.\tPlanning and Assessment of Data for Project Formulation45.\tPresent water utilization in India46.\tPresent water utilization in India47.\tRainfall Runoff Relationships48.\tRunoff and Infiltration49.\tSurface and Ground Water Resources50.\tThe Science of Surface and Ground Water51.\tTools for water resources planning and management52.\tWater allocation priorities53.\tWater resources potential54.\tSubsurface Movement of Water55.\tPrinciples of Ground Water Flow56.\tWell Hydraulics57.\tFlow Dynamics in Open Channels and Rivers58.\tGeomorphology of Rivers59.\tSediment Dynamics in Alluvial Rivers and Channels60.\tIndiaâs Irrigation Needs and Strategies for Development61.\tParticipatory irrigation management (PIM)62.\tClassification of irrigation schemes63.\tHistory of Irrigation Development64.\tSoil Water Plant Relationships65.\tWater absorption by plants66.\tEstimating Irrigation Demand67.\tImportant terms related to crop water requirements and irrigation68.\tTypes of Irrigation Schemes and Methods of Field Water Application69.\tTraditional Water Systems70.\tCanal Systems for Major and Medium Irrigation Schemes71.\tDesign of Irrigation Canals72.\tConveyance Structures for Canal Flows73.\tRegulating Structures for Canal FlowsAll topics are not listed because of character limitations set by the Play Store.",
