All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007. The show is centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons); Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense. Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard; Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch), Howard's girlfriend (later his wife), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend), and Stuart Bloom (Kevin Sussman), the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit. The seventh season is scheduled to premiere on September 26, 2013.DISCLAIMER: The Big Bang Theory FanFront is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Big Bang Theory entities, or CBS.
