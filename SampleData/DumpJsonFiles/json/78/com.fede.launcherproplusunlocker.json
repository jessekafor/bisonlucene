    "description": "Important: PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION BEFORE PURCHASING!Notice: Due to recent changes in the Gmail app that prevent 3rd party apps from accessing your inbox, the LauncherPro Gmail widget is not working with version 2.3.5+ of the Gmail app. If you have version 2.3.4 or lower, the widget should continue to work fine.This app unlocks the Plus features in LauncherPro. You must have the latest version of LauncherPro (free) installed on your phone. This app will not show in your app drawer and it just acts as a license key to unlock the Plus features.After installing this, restart LauncherPro (by clicking Menu > Preferences > Restart LauncherPro) and you should now be running LauncherPro Plus. You can check this by pressing Menu > Preferences, then under LauncherPro it should say \"LauncherPro Plus vX.XX\"This Unlocker only works with the official LauncherPro releases. Modded/themed versions of LauncherPro will not be unlocked by this app.",

Even without any support over the past two years, it still is considered one of the better launchers out there, and the only reason it isn\\'t considered one of the best launchers is that it is starting to become a little dated.  It is small, fast, and has many great features, unfortunately as it ages it also doesn\\'t have some of the great features available in the newer versions of Android.  I would love to see this launcher supported and developed again, it was ahead of it\\'s time when it came out.",
