    "description": "Can you believe PS Vita only sales for $187 with like new condition and TomTom 340tm only sales for $38 with like new condition? Believe me, I tried on Amazon Warehouse Deal, and I see \"like new\" condition is a really very new condition, even the film is still attached, the only thing I think is not so brand new is the box, but I don't care about the box, would you? Now I only buy \"like new\" stuff from Amazon since it is so cheap and the condition is so good!I must admit I am a greedy guy that I want to get an even cheaper price for those deals, that is why I developed this small app which can help me trace the price from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Try it, you will see how much you can save from it!!",

Great program from great developers definitely a helpful app.  If you are worried about using too much data, just use the wifi in your home.  This app can save you a lot of money if you know what you are looking for.",
