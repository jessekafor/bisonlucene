        "comment": "Used a few of these virtual closet apps,  this one is the best by far.  Comes in handy since I have a tiny closet and never know what I have.  This is also the best way to keep all your clothes in rotation.  One suggestion would be to add the option to take multiple pictures of each piece of clothing since some have front and back detail that you would like to show.  Excellent app!",
