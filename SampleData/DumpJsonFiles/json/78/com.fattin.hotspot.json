And any end-user who has purchased internet access can connect to the internet via your hotspot, earning you revenue for every minute that they use your hotspot.You can set you hotspot's price from within that app. There is no upfront cost to use the service, the service fee will be deducted from the earnings, and your payout will be 70% from the revenue generated by your hotspots.And yes, you can have multiple hotspots in different locations generating revenue towards your account. If you have multiple Android phones, you could place them in a secure place connected to an AC outlet at:- Airport terminals- Coffee shops- Restaurants- Tourist destinations- Your place of work- Any place where WiFi is needed!No advanced setup is needed, just download the app, signup, and set your price. Then wait for WiFi users to connect to your hotspot.See https://www.fattin.com/faq.php for more information.(The invitation phase has ended, this is the public BETA release of \"Paywall\" by Fattin Hotspot Network, and requires ROOT permissions. We would like to thank everyone for your valuable feedback!)Search words: wi-fi, tether, tethering, earn cash, make money, paywall",

Can we just get a app that allows us to have a start page captive portal everyone will see when first connecting to our hotspot tether. Can anyone help.",
