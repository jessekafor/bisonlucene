        "comment": "You have to be so close for sample image to appear, can\\'t get a real idea how it will look.  Also, they don\\'t have their entire catalog available.  To use it, print the target out, or, one is included with your order. Then, put on wall, I used scotch tape.  Then, select image in app, aim at wall with target and image will suddenly appear. Move closer if image doesn\\'t appear at first, THEN you can snap a screenshot of it.  Shrug. Could be a lot better.",
