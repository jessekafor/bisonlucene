Thank you!â\"I'm a life coach - I find your videos excellent; clear & easy to follow - all the exercises for the price of a pot of face cream!âI've followed the exercise programme since January and am very pleased with the results already. I had been doing a VERY well-known American face exercise program for 10 years & I didn't think my face would improve that much but it has, so thank you very much!â âI've just looked at my passport photo taken 3 years ago. I'm amazed at the changes in my face: my eyelids have lifted, my cheeks and lips look fuller, my jowls are lessening' It makes so much sense we exercise our bodies, why not our faces?I feel so much better about myself.\"Faceworks is the only face exercise program approved by the Complementary Therapistsâ Association, a leading UK professional association.The videos show 51 year old therapist and creator of Faceworks, Elaine Bartlett.
