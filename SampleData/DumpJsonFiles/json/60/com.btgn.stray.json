    "description": "Carl Ingram, is a handsome, middle-aged drifter who has a big chip on his shoulder.  Pin-balling across the U.S., he is always resourceful enough to find work and an accommodating woman to take him in.  Still wrestling with a deep hatred for his recently deceased father, Carlâs hair-trigger anger is never far beneath an exterior that appears â at turns â both charming and cavalier.   But, when Carl discovers a beautiful Siberian husky at his job site, he is suddenly forced to face his demons.
