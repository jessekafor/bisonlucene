    "description": "Got Questions? Ask Bullhorn and people nearby will answer!   1. Use Bullhorn for work! \"Where's the best place to take my client for lunch today in Centre Square?\" \"Can anyone nearby help clean out our storage room? $100 wage for project.\" \"We need extras in Patterson Park for a 3pm commercial shoot. Compensation is $50\" 2. Use Bullhorn for play! \"Anyone in Central Park up for softball?\" \"Where's the best Tuesday happy hour special in Canton Square?\" \"What's the best running route in Adams Morgan? 3. Use Bullhorn for emergencies! \"My car battery is dead! Can someone nearby please bring me jumper cables?\" \"Baking a cake and don't have an egg.  Can someone on S. Lakewood Ave help?\" \"I'm late for my 10am interview and can't find parking on Boston St.  Any suggestions on where to park for free?\" Bullhorn makes asking and answering questions on Android easy and fun. Bullhorn is a mobile application that simplifies how we get and share information on the go. Hereâs how it works: If you have a question, ask Bullhorn and the app will notify people nearby to answer.  Just imagine you have a giant megaphone (a bullhorn) and you yell out your question. People nearby use their \"megaphone\" to yell back answers. Bullhorn is also great for finding out information about areas to which you are traveling. For example, you can ask your question, drag the map to the location of your question, and Bullhorn finds local people to answer you. Itâs great if youâre headed across town and have questions about traffic, parking, food specials, crowds and much more. Use your Bullhorn and shout out your question today!",
