    "description": "AVX absolutely blows away Google Now, Siri and every other assistant when it comes to useful features. If you haven't tried it yet what are you waiting for? TRY IT FOR FREE NOW: http://www.eva4android.com/avxdownloadIt's the only assistant that has a dedicated car mode and literally over a hundred more features than the rest. Browse through the command list and you will see that it's no lie that AVX is the leader when it comes to useful features: http://www.eva4android.com/quickstartAVX is a must have app if you want to use voice to increase your productivity. It's like Siri but with so many truly useful functions you will wonder why it doesn't come standard with Android. It includes a dedicated Car Mode that is extremely useful if you want to use your phone while driving. It is the one application that makes your smart phone so much smarter. It includes a powerful Profiles feature that allows you to change loads of settings on your phone in one instant simply by changing the Profile. There are over 30 videos on YouTube (link below) that walk you though every aspect of the application. Take advantage of the free 28 day trial as you cannot possibly try it in a few hours let alone a week.

On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has extremely useful functions that will make your life easier then give AVX a try.AVX has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never knew were possible.
