    "description": "New : The ability to look up unknown words using wikipedia or dictionary.com.This is a game of logic and deduction. Its ideal for kids and adults alike. The game involves deducing a word or number based on logic. The mystery can be a 4 letter random number, a random word or limited to your chosen category like, country names, city names, animal names etc.The bulls and cows guide your journey.A Cow represents an accurate character in your guess but in the wrong spot. A Bull, represents an accurate character in your guess that is also at the right spot. You dont know which character was the bull or the cow. You get 10 tries to get it right. If too difficult you can choose to play with hints enabled. To increase difficulty, remove hints and also add the ability to allow duplicate characters in the word. This is done using the phone's menu button. At the end of each play, the game gives you the opportunity to know more about the word, animal, country , city , flower etc, by taking you to the wikipedia or dictionary.com entry for that mystery word.Tease your brain, learn new things and most of all, Have Fun !!!",
