        "title": "Decent Candy Crush Clone",
        "comment": "Candy Crush itself is of course a \\\"beautified\\\" clone of Bejeweled, so let\\'s not take anything away from Candy Game (Crunch). Gameplay is fine, the levels are a bit too few, but altogether worth a dollar. It is not without shortcomings,  however, such as the inability to detect no further moves possible and automatically reshuffle. Changing the shapes of the \\\"candies\\\" in the latest version was also a strange move because it added nothing to the game while making them look less like candies!",
