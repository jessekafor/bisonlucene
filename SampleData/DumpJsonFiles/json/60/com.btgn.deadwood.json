    "description": "Welcome to Deadwoodâthe Ann Charles version. The world I have created is blend of the present day and the past, of non-fiction and fiction.  Whatâs real and whatâs not is for you to determine as the series develops, the characters evolve, and I write line by line of the stories. I will tell you one thing about the seriesâitâs going to run on for quite awhile, and Violet Parker will have to hang on and persevere through the crazy adventures I have planned for her. Poor, poor Violet. Itâs a good thing sheâs got a lot of gumption to keep her going!Book 1:  Nearly Departed in DeadwoodâWatch out Stephanie Plum, because Violet Parker is coming your way.â ~Deborah Schneider, RWA Librarian of the Year 2009 & author of Promise Me* * *The first time I came to Deadwood, I got shot in the ass.âViolet ParkerIrony is having a big olâ fiesta and Violet Parker is the piÃ±ata.  Little girls are vanishing from Deadwood, South Dakota, and Violetâs daughter could be next.  Short on time and long on worry, sheâs desperate to find the monster behind the abductions.  But with her jerkoff co-worker trying to get her fired, a secret admirer sending creepy love poems, and a sexy-as-hell stranger hiding skeletons in his closet, Violet just might end up as one of Deadwoodâs dearly departed.* * *âNearly Departed in Deadwood is a delightful mix of on the edge suspense and laugh-out-loud humor.  Ann Charles is a star in the making!â ~Gerri Russell, award-winning author of Seducing the Knight",
