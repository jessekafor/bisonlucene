        "comment": "The Duke and the Lost Night is a perfect short story romance. I was looking for a historical short story romance that took me away for a few minutes to fall in love with a duke. Not sure why the last reviewer had her knickers in a bunch, I wasn\\'t expecting a 400 page book for .99 and was more that happy with this fun read! Everyone needs to be swept away by a duke! :)",
