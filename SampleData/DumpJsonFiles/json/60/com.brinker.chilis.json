It would be nice for them to all be collected here instead of me having to search through FB and Twitter on my phone to find the current one when I\\'m there eating.   Also I am a member of the Chilihead Nation, it would be nice if that was integrated into the app.  I\\'ll keep this app around in case I travel and want to find a Chili\\'s.  I hope it gets updated/upgraded to be more useful.    PROS:   can find a Chili\\'s based on my current location, can call that Chili\\'s with a click. Integrated QR scanning app Can send Chili\\'s e-gift cards from the app  CONS:   no coupons no menu unless I pick a specific Chili\\'s location and choose online order no nutritional info place order function doesn\\'t seem to work (loads forever) No \\\"directions\\\" button for locations (even if it linked to an online map place that would be helpful) Chilihead nation not represented",

I found that I enjoyed the link to the videos, I also think it\\'s great that you can send an e-certificate using this app. It was great at featuring the new menu selections. However, there are several disadvantages. First of all, I wish that the e-card feature would also allow you to add credits from your own e-cards and use it like a phone debit e-card. Most disappointing, is that it will not show a menu or allow me to online order for any of the restaurants in Hawaii.",
