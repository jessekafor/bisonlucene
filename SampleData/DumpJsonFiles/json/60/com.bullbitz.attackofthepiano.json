How about options to disable applause and that splash screen which was clever once but TEDIOUS every time we minimize or hit the back button accidentally.",

        "comment": "This game would be fun if it weren\\'t so frustrating. The keys are too small for the average adults\\'fingers. This song songs aren\\'t  recognizable and therefore, hard to follow. Also, there are words appearing on the screen blocking the notes making it hard to see them, causing you to s*** the room key if any at all. Overall, the concept is good but the execution needs work.",
