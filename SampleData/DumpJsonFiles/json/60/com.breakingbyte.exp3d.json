    "description": "Enjoy a challenging vertical space-shooter, a tribute to old-school shmups like Ikaruga or DoDonPachi. \"It's the shmup you were looking for.\" - AppsZoom.com\"If youâre a fan of old-school space shooters you are going to love Exp3D.\" - SuperGameDroid.comExp3D features:â 4 chapters with unique bossesâ 60 FPS fast-paced actionâ Full 3D environment and shipsâ Epic soundtrackâ Bonus and ship upgradesâ No shady Android permissionâ 100% free if you're a hardcore gamerHTML5/WebGL demo also available on http://www.breakingbyte.com/exp3d/demo/----------------------How to play?----------------------Move your ship around by touching the screen and dodge enemy bullets.Your special weapon reloads over time, when it's fully loaded double-tap anywhere or touch its icon to unleash its power. Some enemies drop orbs, grab them to upgrade your ship and unlock new content. ----------------------Bonus----------------------â¢ Clear a chapter without taking a single hit and get +5 extra orbsâ¢ Clear a chapter without using your special weapon and get +5 extra orbsâ¢ \"Hellfire\" boosts your fire-power for 5 secondsâ¢ \"Time Warp\" slows down time for 4 secondsâ¢ \"Super Shield\" makes you immune to bullets but not to collisions with enemy ships----------------------FAQ----------------------â¢ Is the game free to play?Yes. You can play the whole game from the beginning to the end completely for free, but you will have to be good. Really good.You will have to clear all the chapters at 100%, that means not taking any damage nor using your special weapon and grab all the orbs. You also won't be able to enjoy all the ship upgrades the shop offers because all your orbs will be spent unlocking new chapters. â¢ What does the \"full version\" offer?In the full version you are not required to clear a level at 100% to access the next level. You still have to unlock levels one by one but you can now afford to use orbs for ship upgrades.â¢ How do I use the orbs?New orbs can be acquired by playing the game. Orbs can be used either to unlock new levels or to buy upgrades for your ship.----------------------Story----------------------In the early years of the 4th millenium, advances in technology allowed humans to spread from their homeworld and initiate a colonization of other celestial worlds. Begining with the establishment of settlements on Earth's planetary neighbors, human expansion progressed over the centuries to finally reach most of the planets of the solar system.After a breakthrough in warp drive systems was achieved, humans consider extending their influence to other stars and so a fleet was formed to be sent to the adjacent system: Alpha Centauri.What happened to the expedition remains unknown but communication ceased shortly after the ships entered the Alpha Centauri system.3 months after the incident Earth was attacked by an unknown powerful enemy fleet - an unprecedented event in mankind history.It is believed that the human expedition in Alpha Centauri angered a dormant civilization which perceived the human move as an aggression.The outcome of the conflict was not looking bright for the humans but the analyze of defeated enemy ships lead to an interesting discovery: the vessels seemed to use as a power source some shining orbs made from an unknown material.Although Earth suffered heavy damage, humans still possess a mean of retaliation: the Exp3D ship is a powerful spacecraft built with the latest state-of-the-art technology and has been upgraded to take full advantage of the same orbs the enemy uses.The Exp3D is now in your hands to shape humanity's fate! ----------------------If you enjoy shooter games like Ikaruga, R-Type, Tyrian, Radiant, Gradius, Mushihimesama,  Deathsmiles, AirAttack, Sky Force, Xelorians, Shogun, Icarus-X or other bullet-hell / danmaku / scrolling shooter games, give Exp3D a try!",

The game was competant so i hit the pay button expecting 1 or 2 bucks but was greeted with a surprising 3! I know it\\'s just a dollar difference but its the principle. You can find better polished and valued games with more levels for the respectable price of one or two. I understand your indy developers that need to get funds but im a consumer that just dosent give out funds that easily.",
