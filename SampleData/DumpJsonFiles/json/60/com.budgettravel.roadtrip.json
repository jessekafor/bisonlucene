        "comment": "The App appears in the early stages of development on my Samsung 4G Infuse Android phone and should probably not have been released at this point since it will likely receive additional negative feedback. There is great potential here. Photos, maps, places to visit, good spots to eat are present. I would really like to see the App developed. It operated slowly and I had several crashes. When working, the articles appeared overwritten at one point. I went to search for the rocky mountain and ended up with what appeared to be Rocky Mountain Nat\\'l Park overwritten by Olympic park and a picture of Hurricane Ridge (I think - not sure because I could not read the caption). The program is VERY frustrating at this point but again very good potential; would love to be able to rate it a 4 or 5 soon. App has been uninstalled.",
