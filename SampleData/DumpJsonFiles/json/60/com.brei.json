I kind of went around it to get to meet my email and other stuff.. go to how to apply, scroll down,  hit \\\"visit our website\\\" it will bring up the home page of NOVA and then just sign into \\\"my nova\\\" then go from there like you would do from a regular computer.  It may be a pain but it\\'s a way. They do need to get an actual mobile app! For the BB APP go into app store, search \\\"learn bb\\\" and there\\'s blackboard!",
