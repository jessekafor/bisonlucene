        "comment": "This is a very cool & useful app.  I especially like the news and calendar sections in the menu.  I like knowing what\\'s going on at NPL.  Nashville has a great public library system.  The residents of Nashville can really be proud of the facilities & the staff that makeup NPL.   I gave it four stars only because, for some reason, I couldn\\'t login to my library account through the app.  Maybe it\\'s a bug... I don\\'t know.  But I\\'m sure whatever it is, it\\'ll be fixed soon.  Now, if I could only use this app to check books out.  That would be awesome! Edit:  Now I can login!",
