        "comment": "I already had a regular scale and there are lots of Android apps for logging your weight (by entering the weight into Android by hand), but there only seem to be 2 apps that will automatically sync that data to RunKeeper: This and some app that\\'s not even in the Android Market. So I tried this one. I was able to get it working with my T-Mobile MyTouch 4G (AKA HTC Glacier), but as others have mentioned, you need to re-sync the phone to the scale (which involves pressing a button inside the battery compartment on the bottom of the scale) every time you use it. I also realized that the weight reported by this app is about 5 pounds less than it should be. (I compared the reading taken by the app w/ a reading taken w/ the scale through Wii Fit, my other scale, and a professional scale in my gym).  BUT - If you don\\'t bother syncing the app w/ your scale, it gives you the option to enter a weight manually and then it immediately syncs that with RunKeeper. So far, that seems to work great. But it\\'s kind of silly to have to use this app for something that simple. And you *will* have to pay $1 for the Wii Scale Extensions companion app to get the RunKeeper syncing functionality.",

        "comment": "Works on my Samsung S3 running Jelly Bean. Syncing with the board each time isn\\'t that big a deal - I think this is a limitation of the board not the app (and pressing the sync button is quicker than firing up Wii Fit each time). My only concern is whether it is accurate - I weighed myself in Wii Fit then immediately after with WiiScale and I was 3 pounds lighter according to the app. I think Wii Fit is pretty accurate after comparison with other scales, so a little wary of trusting this app\\'s readout. However, if you are weighing yourself only with the app and comparing your weight only with its readouts, I guess it doesn\\'t really matter!",
