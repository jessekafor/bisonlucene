    "description": "EVA absolutely blows away Google Now, Siri and every other assistant when it comes to useful features. If you haven't tried it yet what are you waiting for? TRY IT FOR FREE NOW: http://www.eva4android.com/evadownloadIt's the only assistant that has a dedicated car mode and literally over a hundred more features than the rest. Browse through the command list and you will see that it's no lie that EVA is the leader when it comes to useful features: http://www.eva4android.com/quickstartEVA is a must have app if you want to use voice to increase your productivity. It's like Siri but with so many truly useful functions you will wonder why it doesn't come standard with Android. It includes a dedicated Car Mode that is extremely useful if you want to use your phone while driving. It is the one application that makes your smart phone so much smarter. It includes a powerful Profiles feature that allows you to change loads of settings on your phone in one instant simply by changing the Profile. There are over 30 videos on YouTube (link below) that walk you though every aspect of the application. Take advantage of the free 28 day trial as you cannot possibly try it in a few hours let alone a week. Read the reviews to see what other people are saying and if you like it please tell your family, friends and co-workers.Who should use EVA? If you are looking for an application that provides hands-free operation of your phone then EVA is right for you. If you are just looking for an electronic friend to chat with then please go with one of the Siri clones. On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has extremely useful functions that will make your life easier then please give EVA a try.EVA has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never knew were possible. Here is a list of some of the functions that you wont find in most of the competition:â Voice messaging, emails, memos and journals using your own voiceâ Reading and replying to incoming text (including Google Voice) and email (including Microsoft Exchange)â Reading and replying to incoming instant messages via Google Talkâ Integration with Google+â Integration with Evernoteâ Integration with Taskerâ Home Automation with INSTEON.

I recently bought an S3 and one of the first apps I installed was Eva and she runs quite a lot quicker on that than on the tablets. Peter is a great developer - The ONLY developer I\\'ve ever known to respond to an automated bug-report and he fixed the issue within an hour or two and implemented a suggestion to work around an issue with TalkBack within a couple of days. Eva continues to get better and better even though there are a few niggles.",

After the developer\\'s continual dedication and improvements, I am now very happy with this app.   It is updated with new functions added at least twice a month, so you never know what extras are coming next, and that\\'s exciting.  It works efficiently and is very useful.  Sold!",
