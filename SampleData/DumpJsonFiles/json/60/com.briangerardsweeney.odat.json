    "description": "Deal Daemon is a search tool which will allow patrons of popular 'one deal at a time' sites to define and save searches and receive notifications when a deal is offered on a supported site.Users can quickly enter and save search terms.  Optionally, the user can test their terms and refine their search by locating a specific product at a supported site and search for an exact match.  The software will run in the background and alert users when a potential match appears on one of the participating sites.The background service can be turned on or off at any time.  Notification style (vibrate, LED, system alert sound), and polling interval (frequency of searching) are all user configurable.",
