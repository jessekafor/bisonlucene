        "comment": "For my purposes, primarily renewing books, the app can\\'t compete with the website. There\\'s simply no way to renew multiple books at a time, have to wait through a painful process for each book individually. I had the impression that the purpose of mobile apps was to reduce bandwidth and to make common tasks more clear-cut and/or readable, and this isn\\'t firing on all cylinders, missing this second improvement.",

        "comment": "This is a really useful app. I can be out of state and renew books we brought with us, and request books or movies. I can pull up within seconds when our library closes and so much more. This has been so helpful for our library lovin\\' family.   The only thing I wish it had (and this may have to happen with the system before it can happen with the app) is a count of how many people are in front of me for a requested item. It would just be nice to know and help keep me or others patient.",

What used to be instantaneous search results now take two minutes or longer. Strange bug where it logs you out sporadically, and logs you in as someone seemingly named \\\"I Have An Account\\\".",
