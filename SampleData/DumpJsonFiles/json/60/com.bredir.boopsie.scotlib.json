You can even scan any bookâs barcode to find out if we have it in the library.Searching our catalog on the app is much easier too. You donât even have to type in full words or wait for your results. Just type in the first few letters of each word and the search begins while youâre still typing. So if youâre looking for a book about George Washington, simply type âgeo wasâ.We hope you enjoy having the library with you wherever you go!",
