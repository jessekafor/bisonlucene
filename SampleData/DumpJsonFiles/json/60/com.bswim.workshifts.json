I need to add a shift and this error will not let me do so, so I have the shift as a note but this doesn\\'t add to mht hours or show up on the widget. Fix?",

Some suggestions for improvement: 1) Show total hours worked per day.  2) Create a quick entry option for people like me who get paid in 6 minute increments.  3) Consider adding wage amount for hourly employees to include overtime and shift differential pay options.  But with all things considered, this is a solid app.",
