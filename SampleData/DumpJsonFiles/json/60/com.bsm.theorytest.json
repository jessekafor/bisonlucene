        "comment": "Why did I not check the reviews before I purchased?  I\\'m using a galaxy s3. The app is progressively sluggish the more you use it. Frequently it does not display images for questions and when it does, clicking the thumbnail often just blows up a small segment of the image instead of displaying the whole scene.   Reviewing incorrectly answered questions is a nightmare also as the app grinds to a near holt, i\\'m not sure how you are supposed to learn from your mistakes?!  Also, often there are only 2 multiple options for a question when there should be four.   Finally Its almost impossible to scroll through any lists to try and get the info you need.   I am very disappointed and worst of all I am not sure how to get my money back. Worse still actually, I think it may give wrong answers as being correct on occasion. How did this app get signed off?  I suppose most people will give up chasing a refund for the sake of two quid so well done BSM, line your pockets.. No need to invest in development. I thought you were supposed to be the learning standard but instead you have delivered almost completely unusable tat!  My advice? Don\\'t be swayed by any positive ratings for this product.",
