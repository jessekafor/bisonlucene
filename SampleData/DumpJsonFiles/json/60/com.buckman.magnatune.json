    "description": "A complete music collection, commercial free, nicely organized and streamed to your Android device.  Genres include Classical, New Age, Electronica, Jazz, World, Ambient, Hip Hop, and Alt/Electro/Hard Rock.For free, you can stream over 1300 complete albums of your choice.  A short announcement at the end of each song will tell you what you just heard, and gently remind you that a low-cost monthly subscription at Magnatune.com would remove these announcements.With a membership, you can download any and all our albums, in a variety of DRM-free and perfect-quality formats.Note about logging in: some members with long and complicated passwords have had problems logging in with the Android app. We've seen problems like this with the iPhone app and long passwords, but we're not sure if the problem is that they're very hard to type, or there's a problem with Apache and long passwords. At any rate, if you change your password on Magnatune to something shorter, that seems to solve the Android-logging-in problem.",

So far, only change that would be nice is if the app could use notification/media controls. This would show the app is still playing and allow control from lockscreen etc.",
