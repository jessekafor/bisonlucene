        "comment": "I\\'ve then going to my local library where I don\\'t live too far from my library. I decided do download the library\\'s app. when I tried to login to my account numerous times, it kept on bouncing me back without logging me in. However, the only way to login was to go in a different area of the app. yet I was still having trouble ordering books, DVD\\'s  etc. Don\\'t give me wrong, its a good library app, but in my opinion, it needs a little bit of work. I rate the library app 3 out of 5 for difficulty.",
