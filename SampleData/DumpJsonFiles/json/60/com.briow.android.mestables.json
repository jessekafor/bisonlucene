    "description": "When you were a schoolchild you probably spent \"a few hours\" learning multiplication or addition tables.My kids also did. To make their learning experience easy and entertaining I developed an application for them. I now have the pleasure to share it so that other children benefit from it for free.The idea is rather simple: each of us has very different means of remembering. Some memorize while reading, others while hearing and others while writing. This app familiarizes children (or adults!) with tables using the 3 different methods at once.",
