    "description": "The Brewing Assistant from Brewology101.com is an app for assisting in the brewing of your beer. It helps you build your own recipes by calculating your recipe's IBUs, SRM, OG, FG, and ABV while you build your recipe. Both US customary and metric are supported. The Brewing Assistant will also synchronize your recipes to the Brewology101.com Ale Abacus where you can then edit and delete your recipes or create new recipes. With the ability to sync your recipes to Brewology101.com, you can share your recipes with your friends, family, or the entire internet. It also allows you to backup all your recipes and transfer them to the other Android and iOS devices. To import your recipes into the Brewing Assistant from BeerXML, please import the recipes on Brewology101.com. Then to get the recipes to the Brewing Assistant, all you have to do is perform a sync. No need to manually enter all your recipes into your phone or tablet.Once you're ready to brew, the Brewing Assistant will help you with your mash and your boil. The mash reminder will alert you to stir your mash at the interval you set in the Settings. The boil reminder will alert you to add your ingredients at the times you specified in your recipe.The Brewing Assistant is just the help you need for making your homebrew a success.If you find any errors or have suggestions, please let us know at BrewingAssistant@brewology101.com",

It also has a notes category which I use to put in starting and finishing gravity, and anything that I did special or different than usual.",
