        "comment": "I love podcasts, they let me keep up to date with my favorite shows easily. However, I hate the choice of downloading them again on my PC or watching them on the tablets\\' much smaller screen when I\\'m at home. This app and pocketcasts solve that problem by streaming downloaded podcasts to my PC. Only gripe is that I\\'d like playback progress to be synced when streaming, so I watch from where I left off and when I stop watching, that progress gets updated. This would bump my rating up to a 5 star.",

As server, it stops responding occasionally when there is sudden change of media type or stop synchronizing with player. Also very cumbersome if at all possible to stream to and control different multiple devices at a time. Lastly for sake of we plasma TV users, I think a nice screen saver option should be included to prevent our TVs from burn out!",
