Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushingâs syndrome and unmask latent diabetes. Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption.Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids due to their larger skin surface-to-body mass ratios. Unless directed by a physician, do not use on the underarm or groin area of children. Do not use to treat diaper dermatitis. Use in children less than 3 months of age is not recommended.Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. The most common adverse reactions (incidence â¥ 1%) are headache, application site burning and rash. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare at 1-866-463-3634 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Not for ophthalmic, oral or intravaginal use. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. Safety beyond 4 weeks has not been established.Copyright Â© 2012 Bayer AG. All rights reserved.",

        "comment": "I have lifelong eczema and was really excited about a way to track my flare ups but this is not going to work without more options! I had previously found the Rosacia ap and have been using it to track my eczema even though it was not geared towards it. Excited to see an actual eczema aps but come on . .the rosacia aps has more options than this! We need a way to log what we eat, under stress, showers, weather, around pets, what lotion or treatment, etc!! We need a way to see what is causing a flare.",
