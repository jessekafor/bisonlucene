    "description": "Breaking Bad Raining Meth LWP is a Live Wallpaper based on one of the awesome Breaking Bad 8 bit animated gifs by comedian Paul Scheer ( http://www.paulscheer.com/ ).Check my Breaking Bad Game for Android, too: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=breaking.bad.game.free======================WHAT'S A LIVE WALL PAPER?======================FROM WIKIPEDIAA 'live wallpaper' is a type of application that works on a mobile device using the Android operating system. The application works as a wallpaper â providing the background image for the home screenâbut also works as a conventional application since it can provide user-interaction with the touch screen (allowing the image to change dynamically, for example) and access other hardware and software features within the device (accelerometer, GPS, network access, etc.).Similar functionality could be found in the Active Desktop feature of Windows 98 and later versions. There is also third party software that provides this feature for various operating systems.======================About BREAKING BAD======================FROM WIKIPEDIABreaking Bad is an American television drama series created and produced by Vince Gilligan.
