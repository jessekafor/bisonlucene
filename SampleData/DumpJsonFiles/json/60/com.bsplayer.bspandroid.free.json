Will try again after sometime again. ______________________________________________________________________________ I have been using MX Player for long time, and didn\\'t really believe this player could actually perform better, esp with my old Galaxy S. But really surprised to see how snappy it is in terms of seeking time! I can move to any part of the video almost instantly!   Only gripe is that the UI is quite dated, if it becomes at least like MX Player, I will come back and make it a 5 star!  Keep up the great work!!",

        "comment": "My go to app for playing videos. It plays all of my video formats no problem(vp8/flv mainly) with little to no erros. My drawbacks are the fact the app scans my entire sd card for videos and music. I would like to see an option that allowed me to exclude certain folders. Some folders aren\\'t even media types to begin with so why are they being scanned as if they are? Also, it would be nice to see a menu setting like vplayer or mx player. I will purchase and give 5 stars if the dev ever made this happen.",
