    "description": "The theme for the 2012 ILA Annual Conference is Bouncing Higher, with a red rubber ball as a symbol of resiliency and momentum, as well as the playful, fun aspects of librarianship. Libraries are not only bouncing back from restructuring and budget cuts. They are bouncing higher by going beyond expected boundaries via cutting-edge technological innovation, re-examining core services, reaching out to the community, and becoming more pro-active. The idea of movement is key; moving forward, reaching out, bouncing higher. This is a new age for libraries.If you share the optimism of librarians and trustees from all types of libraries and strive to do more, resurrect your super ball, gain momentum and bounce to new heights at the 2012 ILA Conference at the Peoria Civic Center in Peoria, October 9-11, 2012.",
