    "description": "The Brew Timer is for brewers, professional and amateur alike, who need a better way to keep track of their brew during the brew day. The application allows the brewer to create individual entries for the timing of different brewing events like the addition of hops, spices, a wort chiller, etc. These events can also include a post-boil steeping time, allowing brewers to keep track of additional lengths of time after the boil ends. These events can be grouped together as a Brew Session and can be saved to device memory in a Recipe Profile that can then be loaded when needed for future use. Each Recipe Profile contains all the events needed for a complete brew session.Brew Timer Features:- Create, save, load, and delete multiple Recipe Profiles.- Each Recipe Profile can contain events for all timed brewing processes.- The Brew Timer can sound a user selected alarm and/or vibrate when an event needs your attention.- Events can be added, edited, or removed while the the timer is running in case a modification needs to be made on the fly.- Color-coding of individual event entryâs remaining time lets you quickly determine how soon an event will trigger.- The Brew Timer can be paused and resumed at any time.The Brew Timer is also great for timing coffee roasting, baking or anything else you may need to keep track of multiple timing events.Is there something you would like to see in The Brew Timer?  I have a list of other desired features that other brewers have emailed me, send me an email and tell me what you want! (brewtimer@humanjoe.com)",

They also show in yellow and then red when close to the alarm point. I setup a boil timer w/ hop additions, mash timer, mash out, and aeration. Easy to use and worked flawlessly through my brew. You can save each alarm profile so you can just open them up next time you brew!",

I was also able to set up a timer for my mash. Being able to save the profiles for future use is a huge plus, as I have about 7 recipes in my rotation that receive regular play. The Instructions are very clear, and navigation within the app is simple. I recommend this app to all homebrewers.",

        "comment": "The app interface is clean and easy to follow.  It\\'s a great tool for straight extract brews but unfortunately it falls short for extract + steeped grains, partial mash, and all-grain brewing.  The reason for this is that the app only allows entering a boil time and post-boil \\\"steeping\\\" times but does not allow for mash timing, mash temperature profile changes, etc.    If this app did all grain as well as it does extract, I would give it a 5.  As-is, 3 stars.  I hope the developer continues to work on it and updates it for all grain brewing--it would be an excellent tool!",
