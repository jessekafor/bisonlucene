    "description": "iPuke is simply the best drinking game ever invented. Our team has worked (I mean drunk) really hard to come up with this amazing app and hopefully you'll have a BLAST playing it!Wondering how it works? Ok, here we go!- Matches can have from 2 to 11 players (the more the better!)- The game is played in turns: each player at a time. You start your turn by drawing a card, and each card is made of 2 challenges: to perform a funky dare and, of course, to take a few drinks!- You must either perform the dare or take the drinks before you can pass the phone (and the turn) to the next player. However, if you get greedy, you can do both and double the points!- Cards come in 4 difficulties: easy, medium, hard and extreme. The higher the difficulty, the more points you get and the more you have to drink.- The first player to reach the points goal wins. Plain, simple and very competitive. Intrigued? Then check out some dares you'll face when playing this game:* Text \"I love you\" to a random contact on your phone* Place some ice cubes in your underpants* Sing a song from the Bee Gees* Impersonate a chicken and lay an egg* Have someone draw a mexican moustache on your face* Kiss someone's belly button... that and much more!Are you and your mates up for it?",

        "comment": "Fantastic game, fantastic graphics, and fantastic dares! The concept of this game is just great although if you play it more than once you\\'ll find that challenges get repeated too frequently (sometimes in the one game). Please, please, please add more challenges. Makes a great night!!",
