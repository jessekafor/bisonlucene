    "description": "Trust fund baby Elise drifted around the world from beach to beach, party to party, alone in a crowd, until seven years ago she came to rest in the Islands.  Here she has made an undemanding life for herself in this tropical paradise, independent of both the tourists and the natives.  Only the monkeys know where she lives.  Then a visitor from far away arrives in the Islands, bearing a gift from Eliseâs dead mother.  Thrown off balance, suddenly Elise must ask herself:  where is home?
