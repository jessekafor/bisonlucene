        "comment": "Knights, reincarnation, sexy ghosts! My oh my! The story begins with two medieval knights who die in battle, their souls being unexceptionably intertwined. Skip to 1980. Elinor moves into her Grandmother house to find it occupied by the knight\\'s ghosts. I can\\'t wait to read the complete novel to find out how a mortal falls in love with a ghost! Chris Karlsen is a debut author with a great voice! I visited her website and saw that this is a series! Can\\'t wait to read all of them from this little taste.",
