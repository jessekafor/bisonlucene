    "description": "Bluetooth Autoconnect is an application and widget that allows you to stream music simply via bluetooth.Upon first time launching the APPLICATION or initially adding the WIDGET to your home screen you simply choose your favourite paired device for streaming music to via A2DP (stereo bluetooth).Your chosen device is then taken as your preferred option for future use, so that with one click the app shortcut or widget will switch on bluetooth and connect to your device ready for you to start streaming via your favourite media player application.Should you wish to change the device set as you favourite just press the 'Change Preferred Device' button on the app splash screen or remove the widget from your home screen and re-add.NOTE: THE DEVICE YOU WANT TO CONNECT MUST SUPPORT A2DP. They can be things such as stereo personal headsets and car stereos.-If you like it please rate it.-If you are having problems, check out the website for assistance or contact me and maybe I can help. Please don't just rate it with 1 star and say it doesn't work as this doesn't help anyone and I can't contact you to give you any help. (Particularly if you are using a device which does not support A2DP!)-If you have a bug or suggestion, contact me and I may be able to change it.Future enhancement:Depending upon the level of interest telephony functionality  can be added to this application - currently not supported.Note: Currently available at a discounted price.",

        "comment": "This app works very well on my Galaxy S Wifi 4.2 and is highly recommended as it saves you from going into the menu settings. Those who have problems should contact the developer instead of moaning here.  I use it to connect to my Bluetooth speakers (Sony SRS-BTV25 and Divoom BLUETN): Switch the speaker on, tap the app and you are ready to play music. When finished, just tap the app again to turn Bluetooth off.    UPDATE: It does not work with my Galaxy S3, my Sony Ericsson Live with ICS, nor with my wife\\'s Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 inch tablet. I have emailed the developer but he has had no luck.",

        "comment": "Motorola Droid 3 -- Was looking for a widget to enable my BlueTooth then auto-connect to a paired device at the same time, this app nailed it spot on.   Feature Request 1: Have a widget \\\"Toggle BlueTooth then auto search for devices then auto connect to anything it finds\\\" so that as a user with multiple BlueTooth devices. I only have one device on at a time I\\'m connecting to (Truck radio, motorcycle helmet, etc) so this would remove the need for multiple widget toggles for each BlueTooth device. The auto-search and connect would more or less be an attempt to connect to each device in sequence and if not connected attempt the next device.  Feature Request 2: One thing I\\'d like to see that\\'d make it even better would be to color code the widget based on status (Red icon = BlueTooth off & Blue or Green icon = Bluetooth on and connected) as another visual.  Couple minor feature additions and it\\'d be hands down a 5-star amazing app for me, 4 stars currently. App does exactly what it says it does and does it very easily with minimal permission requirements.",

For all of those that have problems getting to work on there device, here is a suggestion: Contact the developer and let them know, or try a alternate app. Do you know how hard it is to get something to work with multiple version of android, multiple manufactures, and multiple skins. Sometimes it takes the right feedback from the community to learn of compatibility issues.  Why give a 1 star rating just because it doesn\\'t work with your device. That is just like saying that diesel fuel sucks because I have an unleaded fuel only car. Why criticize a better product just because you cant use it.  5 stars for simplicity, functionality, cheap price, regular updates",
