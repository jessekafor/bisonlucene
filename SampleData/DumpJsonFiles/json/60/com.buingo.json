    "description": "We all know of the feeling of suddenly waking up and having no idea where we are. Right? But that all change now with the release of the Where am I?-application, a one-click, no-fuss tool that will tell you what you need to know; where you are.The application can be particularly useful if you're Narcoleptic and have friends that take advantage of this by moving you halfway across the country before you wake up.Disclaimer: GPS or network location required. Might not work too well in all areas around the globe. You should not rely on this application for anything.",
