I spend a lot of time just tapping my screen at random trying to get my character to go somewhere.  The ui is unintuitive. Messages are variations of \\\"you can\\'t do that\\\" and \\\"you can\\'t go there\\\". Why show the hand icon when I can\\'t pick up an item? Just to say \\\"you can\\'t carry that item\\\". Or the magnifying glass for useless items? That\\'s just more wasted taps on my screen.",
