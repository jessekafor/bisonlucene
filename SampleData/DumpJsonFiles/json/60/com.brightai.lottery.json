Always wanted a number checker, just add your regular numbers on any of the games and it does the hard work for you, i like the way it highlights the numbers you may have matched which stops you going over each one 5 times before you finally accept you didn\\'t win lol. Its got a euro raffle which saves me booting up my computer, to top it all its even got the prize breakdown. Love this handy little app THANKS",
