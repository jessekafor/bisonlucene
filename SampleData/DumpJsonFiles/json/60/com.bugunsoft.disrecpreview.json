This thing is not working, and when I go and check my recordings, it shows the time, but all of them are 0 bytes, in other words, it didn\\'t record anything. If you\\'re going to keep an app in the market, make sure it works.  For all of you that want to download the software, don\\'t type the period in the end. For example, the website to download ends in \\\".zip\\\" and then on the app it has an extra period at the end like this \\\".zip.\\\" So just don\\'t type the last period, and you should be able to download it!",

This app does work, and to my knowledge, it is the only screen recorder that doesnt require root access. As for the enabling on re-boot, its not difficult or time consuming.. Plug in the usb and click enable on the program.. My only problem with this app is the low capture rate. Recording at 5fps is not what i was looking for, but for video tutorials and non-game related recording this is fine. Thanks",
