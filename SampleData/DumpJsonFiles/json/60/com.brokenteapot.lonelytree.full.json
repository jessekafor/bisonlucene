    "description": "The Summer and Spring versions have been released!Try the demo version first to make sure you're happy with it!\"Lonely Tree\" is a live wallpaper designed with the Nexus 10 in mind, with high-resolution textures and a tablet-friendly holo-themed settings panel. It looks and feels beautiful on standard sized phones as well.The winter nature scene reacts dynamically to the wind speed range selected in the settings, with the tree gently swaying in the wind, the bushes fluttering, and the snowflakes becoming faster and more streaky.Almost everything is customizable including the strength of the wind, the amount of snow, and the size and position of the tree. You can optionally add Christmas lights to the tree, and change it to night-time to really see them glow.\"Easy on the phoneâs memory and is just soothing to watch\"www.droid-life.com\"Grab a cup of hot chocolate, sit back and enjoy a beautiful winter scene\"www.DroidApps.org\"Itâs a simple, somber winter scene thatâs fully customizable and very beautiful\"www.android-apps.comTO USE:Long Press On Desktop->Wallpapers->Live WallpapersSome features I plan to add over the next few months:* Secondary trees in background* Brightness/Contrast settings* More complex cloud layers* Snowflakes in the snowdrifts* More natural tree branch movements (independent of each other)* Wind gusts* Optional fence in front of the tree* Birds (or other animals) flying in the backgroundAnd over the next year:* Other seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall)* Different weather types (sun, fog, etc...)",

This live wallpaper is more subtle yet has lots of depth, which is rare in mobile graphics. The lighting in the clouds is naturalistic and super beautiful. I quite like the snow and rain, sort of moody in a pretty way. I especially appreciate how spring is early spring. Great job.",
