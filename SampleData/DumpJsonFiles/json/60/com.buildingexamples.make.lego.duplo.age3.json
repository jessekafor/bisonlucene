    "description": "Lego duplo bricks are great for the youngest children. The larger pieces allow toddlers to use the bricks and blocks with their own small hands. They will lose their imagination with animal figures, buildings, cars, boats, towers, castles and all kind of structures. As a father, I'm proud to see my toddlers play and develop their motoric skill. These lego duplo examples are realy great! Help your child making nice lego duplo constructions and let them learn at the same time. These are step-by-step instructions for children starting from the age of 3 years old! Have fun!",
