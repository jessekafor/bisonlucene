The neighborhood is still here and the people that inhabit it. But weâre in a different time now, a time when the residents were a little bit younger but had in no way lost their stalwart vision of community protection.Trouble has come to the neighborhood in the form of two men, war veterans, arrogant in their ways and not afraid to show it. Strange things are happening: Vandalism, Brutal acts of violence--a total disregard for human decency.But what remains the strangest of all lies within the heart of Potterâs Forest. A pathway to salvation, or a doorway to the very Gates of Hell?
