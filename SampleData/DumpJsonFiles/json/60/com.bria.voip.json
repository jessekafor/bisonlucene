        "comment": "1st - it\\'s the most expensive SIP client on Android, and has the least features. 2nd - I had to pay for the add-=on to allow Google Voice integration.             However, you can\\'t make outbound calls on the GV account?             That\\'s not even half a feature then!?!?!?!? 3rd - the customer service for Bria is non-existent, and certainly won\\'t credit you back when their crap software doesn\\'t work as advertised.    Too bad for them, as someone in the position to recommend VIOP clients to hundreds of users (I sell IT solutions), they screwed the pooch.",

        "comment": "Works fine!  Only problem is other SIP devices (such as my desk telephone at work) keep trying to grab the line away.  Our SIP only allows a single extension to register the line, so the Bria app ends up fighting with my desk phone over it.  However, that\\'s a limitation of our SIP server at work, not of Bria.  Minor gripe: Bria does not detect face proximity, so you have to hold phone away from your face otherwise you touch buttons by accident with your face!",

        "comment": "I\\'ve been using Bria for a while because all functions work out the box with Asterisk pbx in the office over WiFi.   It\\'s worth the cost for that alone.     Unfortunately, the product suffers from irritating bugs such as random crashes every few days and unlocking the screen whenever the phone rings resulting in hanging up on calls accidentally when digging out your phone.   If it weren\\'t for those bugs, I would have given it five stars.",
