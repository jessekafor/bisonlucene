Although the App does work as advertised when near a hotspot, it would be much more useful if it would actually work on the road without the need for a data connection. A small database like that could easily fit on the phone or SD card. One suggestion for improvement would be to include WiFi hotspot info in the restaurant listing.  I generally stick to McDonalds because of their reputation for having hot spots, but I would like to go to other restaurants too.",
