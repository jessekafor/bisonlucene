These teachings, preserved in texts concern the quest for liberation from suffering. While the ultimate aim of the Buddha's teachings is thus to help individuals attain the good life, his analysis of the source of suffering centrally involves claims concerning the nature of people, as well as how we acquire knowledge about the world and our place in it. These teachings formed the basis of a philosophical tradition that developed and defended a variety of sophisticated theories in metaphysics and epistemology.When he was a young adult his experiences with the outside world drove him to seek out a greater understanding of life and spiritual fulfillment. Through seeking guidance and meditation, Siddhartha Gautama achieved Enlightenment. From that point, he was known as the Buddha, which means 'Enlightened One'. For the rest of his life, the Buddha travelled great distances teaching people about one path to salvation. Buddhism offered hope and access to spiritual understanding and satisfaction to ordinary people.Throughout the world today, people still follow the teachings of the Buddha. Let this amazing wallpaper remind you to bear in mind that problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind. Use it to be your guidance through life.
