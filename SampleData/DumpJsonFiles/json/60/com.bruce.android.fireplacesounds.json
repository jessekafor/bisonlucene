        "comment": "I get one sound. The only thing I can change is the picture displayed. I only get half an hour of sound and when the screen times out so does the sound. No point in installing. This is for every one of these apps. White noise is a much better app. Even the free one is better. And I don\\'t mean the white noise one by this developer. Uninstalled",
