    "description": "Dent Impressions push to paint calculator is designed to show a paintless dent removal technician if a panel is cost effective to push to paint. Push to paint is a repair process that is used when repairing hail damage. A PDR technician will push all the dents to a point where the body shop can paint afterwards. Sometimes, additional conventional work will be needed on some of the dents that will be pushed up. If a panel has broken paint or is too severe to PDR effectively, the technician may choose push to paint to save time for the shop and save money for the insurance company. In order to determine if push to paint is cost effective, the technician can use this app to calculate the maximum they can charge for push to paint for a certain panel. If paintless dent repair doesnât make sense, think about pushing the panel to paint.",
