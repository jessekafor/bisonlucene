        "comment": "I found this app because of what it says, and I bought the pro version of it. The only bad thing that I found was that in the app, a calendar description only supports 26 characters, so when I look at my calendar data from Business Calendar, which has more than 26 characters, OnePunch cuts them off in their program plus Business Calendar too,so data is lost.  I sent two emails about it and no reply, so I un-installed it.",

With the widget or just the app icon, when you hit add a new note, it defaults to the last notebook you used...great if you only use one notebook. But now I constantly have to back out and back out to find the correct notebook....ugggg.  There is also no quick note function...really.  I don\\'t have time to hunt for a place to store all my notes before I can even take them..give us the option to take a note and organize later.  And forget about syncing with your Google calendar....you\\'ll have every task you\\'ve ever entered flooding your widget...and the widget doesnt give you the option to have notebooks listed.  You can have one notebook with its contents displayed or have all notes displayed.   This is fine for someone who is not in a hurry and has time to sit and figit with it.",
