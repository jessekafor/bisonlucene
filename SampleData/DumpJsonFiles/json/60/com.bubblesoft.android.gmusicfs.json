    "description": "GMusicFS is a unique app bringing Google Music streaming capability to most third party music players like Poweramp, PlayerPro and many more, on rooted devices.IMPORTANT: On Android 4.3, Superuser is *required* for GMUsicFS to work as it doesn't work with SuperSU.GMusicFS exposes *all* your Google Music collection as a filesystem, making third party music players access your Google Music tracks as if they were regular files. No audio data is downloaded until you play (stream) a track.Features:- play your uploaded music, playlists and All Access music in your favorite music player- sync your music collection (metadata only) when you make changes- track caching to SD card to save bandwidth- configurable bufferingThis version has the following restrictions that can be removed by purchasing the GMusicFS Unlocker app:- a maximum of 5 albums can be pinned (cached to SD Card)- a maximum of 16 Google Music \"All Access\" tracks can be played per app launch). Regular track playback is unlimitedGMusicFS has not been tested will all combinations of devices / ROM / music players.So in case of an issue, please contact me with the \"Email developer\" link instead of leaving a 1-star review.For setup information and troubleshooting make sure to read the help section in the app carefully.",

First couple of times I could not find any music with Power Amp (as per other reviews) , but followed the authors instructions and got it working and the music is streaming (very reliably) now.   All music seems to be 320kb and not yet supporting the new medium and low quality modes. Having bought a couple of the authors other tools am sure I will end up buying this as well as future development is needed.   Make sure you follow the supplied instructions under the help menu.",

        "comment": "Great tool for finally junking the awful stock Google Music app in order to play All Access and Locker songs from 3rd party apps. The streaming rocks, works well, and is easy to use. For those of you on the fence, that right there should be more than enough reason to drop $3 to buy the full version, support the developer, and get full use out of the app.  The developer is gonna need the support because the caching or it\\'s \\\"Pinning\\\" counterpart on the Google Music app sucks. Firstly, it\\'s only able to cache albums. I understand being unable to cache individual tracks (something Google doesn\\'t do), but the inability to pin playlists in a way that doesn\\'t involve tediously pinning every album included in the list really hurts. Secondly, the actual act of pinning to the device is weird, and shoddy at best. When you \\\"Pin\\\" an album it doesn\\'t begin immediately downloading it as Google\\'s app does, rather you need to play the song in order to cache it.  In a future update I\\'d love to see the following: 1. More options for pinning: pin by Artist, Playlist, etc. 2. Immediate downloading of pinned songs. 3. Ability to control mobile data usage. Other than that, it rocks. Support the dev.",
