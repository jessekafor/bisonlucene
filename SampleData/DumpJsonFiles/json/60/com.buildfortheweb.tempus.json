        "comment": "Hard to complain when it\\'s free, but for me automatic backup of all recorded information is vital. Also there\\'s a bug in restoring from a backup if that backed up data already exists, which makes me sceptical of the robustness of the backups. Otherwise it\\'s a clean, simple interface, which is more than can be said of most time tracking apps.",
