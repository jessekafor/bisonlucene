    "description": "The Bridgestone Guides are internationally recognised as the leading guides to the best restaurants in Ireland. For more than twenty years, the Bridgestone editors have discovered and championed those restaurants that offer the best cooking and the best service in Ireland. In this App you will find bustling city restaurants, and tiny single-room restaurants in the farthest flung corners of the country. Over twenty-one years of publication, the Bridgestone Guides have acquired their reputation as the most fearless and original â and the most imitated â guidebooks to Ireland. This twenty-first edition of the Bridgestone 100 Best Restaurants in Ireland, now available in this App, is yet another celebration of the Irish genius for great cooking, great service and great conviviality. The Bridgestone Guides are respected for their independence, their accuracy, and their ability to discover and describe the most brilliant chefs and restaurants. Here are the top 100 restaurants in Ireland today.",
