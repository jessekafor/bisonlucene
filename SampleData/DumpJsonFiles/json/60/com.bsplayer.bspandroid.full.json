        "comment": "Absolutely the best video player of all mobile OSs. I especially like SMB streaming, works flawlessly.  Just a minor issue - if the SMB server is unavailable, and you were using it last time, it is very hard to return to the list of servers. Please, please - the app should return to the list of servers instead of leaving you in a non-existing directory without a way to go back. There is a workaround (switching to local view and back). But please - fix it, it\\'s annoying.  Also - the AC3 issue. -1 star unless it\\'s fixed.",

        "comment": "was working fine untill the latest update. Last night I did a factory reset on my tablet. I was still using the previous version of the player as I wanted to keep the Dolby capabilities. Did the reset, rooted, reinstalled all of my apps, etc. Everthing was fine untill I fired up BS Player. In LAN mode, I can connect to my computer and see my shared folders, but when I try to open the folders I get a message box that reads \\\"error connecting to share\\\". Alll my other apps work fine. Since I did the reset, the ONLY thing that\\'s different is the latest version of BS Player. It\\'s a 5 star app, but for now I give it 4 because of this new problem. If it isn\\'t fixed promptly, it becomes a 1 star app (which would be a shame as it\\'s great when everything works as it should). ***UPDATE*** 8/3: Problem solved. Went to LAN mode, long press on my computer\\'s IP address to get the edit box, gave it a display name: \\\"My PC\\\". BS Player is now back in action, and back to 5 stars.",
