    "description": ">>ATTENTION! ATTENTION!<<This is an UPDATED VERSION.  If all goes well you will NOT have to do a \"refresh all data\". The app should work with all devices, HOWEVER...If you DO have to do a \"refresh all Data\" in order to get the app to work properly, please SEND ME AN EMAIL BEFORE you leave lousy feedback! Remember that a scout is courteous, and also, that I developed this app for FREE.The Boy Scouts of America's NOVA Awards program incorporates learning with cool activities and exposure to science, technology, engineering and mathematics for Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Venturers. The hope is that the requirements and activities for earning these awards stimulates interest in STEM-related fields and shows how science, technology, engineering and mathematics apply to everyday living and the world around them. Counselors and mentors help bring this engaging, contemporary, and fun program to life for youth members.The Nova AwardsThere are four Nova awards for Cub Scouts, Webelos Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Venturers. Each award covers one component of STEMâscience, technology, engineering, or mathematics.Cub Scout Nova awards: Science Everywhere, Tech Talk, Swing!, and 1-2-3 Go! Boy Scout Nova awards: Shoot!, Start Your Engines, Whoosh!, and Designed to Crunch Venturer Scout Nova awards: Launch!, Power Up, Hang On!, and Numbers Don't LieFor their first Nova award, Scouts earn the distinctive Nova award patch. After that, a Scout can earn three more Nova awards, each one recognized with a separate pi (Ï) pin-on device that attaches to the patch. The patch and the three devices represent each of the four STEM topicsâscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics.The Supernova AwardsThe Supernova awards have more rigorous requirements than the Nova awards. The requirements and activities were designed to motivate youth and recognize more in-depth, advanced achievement in STEM-related activities.For Wolf and Bear Cub Scouts:Dr. Louis Alvarez Supernova Award For Webelos Scouts: Dr. Charles H. Townes Supernova AwardFor Boy Scouts:Dr. Bernard Harris Supernova Bronze AwardThomas Edison Supernova Silver AwardFor Venturers:Dr. Sally Ride Supernova Bronze AwardWright Brothers Supernova Silver AwardDr. Albert Einstein Supernova Gold AwardFor earning the Supernova award, Scouts receive a medal and certificate. All requirements may be found in the Nova awards guidebooks, available through local Scout shopsâone for Cub Scouts, one for Boy Scouts, and one for Venturers. The requirements can be completed with a parent or an adult leader as the counselor (for the Nova awards) or mentor (for the Supernova awards). Each guidebook includes a section for the counselor and mentor.",

        "comment": "I was delighted to find this while searching for apps for my son to track his advancement. He is really excited to complete the NOVA award.  It took a bit to get this working. I didn\\'t realize that I had to hit my MENU button from inside the App and choose \\'Refresh All Data\\\" Now, all the information is available.  This would be a 5 Star app if you could track boys\\' completion. The app is easy to navigate and read on my Nexus tablet. I do have some issues navigating using the back button on my Razr Maxx.",

        "comment": "I love this app! As a Cub Master having all of this info in one easy to access place is really helping me plan my Cub and Webelos programs for this fall. The app is well laid out and super easy to navigate. It will come in handy as my Webelos I transitions in to Boy Scouts.  Another great app for parents and Adult Leaders from this developer.",
