    "description": "For 24 years, SC has been at the forefront in gathering the best and brightest minds in supercomputing together, with our unparalleled technical papers, tutorials, posters and speakers. SC12 will take a major step forward not only in supercomputing, but in super-conferencing, with everything designed to make the 2012 conference the most âyouâ friendly conference in the world. Weâre streamlining conference information and moving to a virtually real-time method of determining technical program thrusts. No more pre-determined technical themes picked far in advance. Through social media, data mining, and active polling, weâll see which technical interests and issues emerge throughout the year, and focus on the ones that interest you the most.",

        "comment": "Thanks. This was a handy app to have at the show.  Searching for vendors\\' booths was helpful, as was the reminder to follow up with a vendor. What would have been nice is to actually put a scheduled meeting on the personal schedule.  Integration with Android / iPhone calendar would also be a nice addition (or email .ics attachment). It should be an option on any scheduled item to \\\"put on calendar\\\", with this action configured, or have the app have its own reminders. Both of these would be useful approaches.",
