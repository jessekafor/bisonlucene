For example the graph right hand scale is in ounces but there are no values, except the floating current price. I\\'d like to see an option for ounces in all the prices. Secondly, the text is too small and there is no way to increase it. Let\\'s face it, the people who trade gold and silver are probably more mature in years than the average Android user. Bigger fonts please for no specs!",
