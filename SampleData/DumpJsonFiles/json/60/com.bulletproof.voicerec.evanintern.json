    "description": "EVAN absolutely blows away Google Now, Siri and every other assistant when it comes to useful features. If you haven't tried it yet what are you waiting for? TRY IT NOW!It's the only assistant that has a dedicated car mode and literally over a hundred more features than the rest. Browse through the command list and you will see that it's no lie that EVA is the leader when it comes to useful features: http://www.eva4android.com/quickstartThis is a free 28 day trial version that has all the same features as the paid version.EVAN is a must have app if you want to use voice to increase your productivity. It's like Siri but with so many truly useful functions you will wonder why it doesn't come standard with Android. It includes a dedicated Car Mode that is extremely useful if you want to use your phone while driving. It is the one application that makes your smart phone so much smarter. It includes a powerful Profiles feature that allows you to change loads of settings on your phone in one instant simply by changing the Profile. There are over 30 videos on YouTube (link below) that walk you though every aspect of the application. Take advantage of the free 28 day trial as you cannot possibly try it in a few hours let alone a week. Read the reviews to see what other people are saying and if you like it please tell your family, friends and co-workers.Who should use EVAN? If you are looking for an application that provides hands-free operation of your phone then EVAN is right for you. If you are just looking for an electronic friend to chat with then please go with one of the Siri clones. On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has extremely useful functions that will make your life easier then please give EVAN a try.EVAN has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never knew were possible. Here is a list of some of the functions that you wont find in most of the competition:â Voice messaging, emails, memos and journals using your own voiceâ Reading and replying to incoming text (including Google Voice) and email (including Microsoft Exchange)â Reading and replying to incoming instant messages via Google Talkâ Integration with Google+â Integration with Evernoteâ Integration with Taskerâ Home Automation with INSTEON.

If you don't already have a third party text to speech voice that replaces the default Pico voice on your phone I recommend SVOX Classic.Download the Free SVOX Classic to demo the voices. EVAN is English only. Please don't give 1 star ratings for not having your language.",

        "comment": "Evan is almost the perfect man! It takes a little work training him.There are still bugs, Evan doesn\\'t always respond. Or he will interrupt what you are doing. The developer is very helpful if you have issues... When the bugs are fixed I\\'ll give him a 5!  Peter, one example is that I was asking Evan to make a call & suddenly he started reciting my reminders. And sometimes it seems he isn\\'t fully loaded & doesn\\'t respond quickly. And sometimes even tho I have a wake phrase, I have to hit speak..",

I didn\\'t do anything. I\\'m not going to buy it until you fix these bugs. I just now had to completely uninstall it before it would even allow me access to my phone.",

        "comment": "I just got the most recent update, and I haven\\'t tried the latest features yet because I\\'m still trying to nail down the ones that are most important to me. For instance, I want to use Evan with my wireless Motorola headset, but he still has a few issues with hearing my responses. If I use the phone, I have to speak directly into the microphone--I can\\'t be more than half an inch away, and this is in a quiet room. There are times where I\\'ll use my wake up phrase, and Evan won\\'t respond at all. Or I\\'ll want to respond to an email, I\\'ll see my response (\\\"Yes\\\") register, and then... he stops listening. Don\\'t get me wrong, this app has AMAZING potential. Once this stuff gets fixed, I will be only too happy to buy it. But right now, it\\'s defeating the purpose of having a hands free device.",

For example one of the new features is to read new emails to you. At the time I download this app it was the only one one the market that was able to do that. But it is to buggy.
