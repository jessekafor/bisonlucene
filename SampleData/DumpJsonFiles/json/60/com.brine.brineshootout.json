    "description": "Ready to take your game to the next level? We hope soâbecause Shootout is back. The updated version of the #1 lacrosse game is loaded up with new Brine gear and high-resolution graphics. And with a brutal new All-Star level to test you, this Shootout isnât just better. Itâs meaner.ACCLAIM FOR SHOOTOUTâOverall, I believe Shootout is a welcome addition to the lives of lacrosse players, and I love that this forward-thinking innovation came from a company founded way back in 1922. Brine Lacrosse continues to lead the way!ââ Krieg Shaw, laxallstars.comâIt is an addictive game, and a necessary download for all LAX fans from 8-88.ââ Andrew Weiner, examiner.com âBrine Shootoutâ¦ easily the best app ever.â â @RealSammyP_03âLoving the Brine Shootout app.ââ @revED_upâBrine Shootout. All day everyday. #addictedââ @TabbiLevengoodâThey finally made a lacrosse game app. Clearly my prayers have been answered.ââ @caaitlynalexisâPlaying Brine Shootout instead of paying attention in class.ââ @RyanStranglandFEATURESâ Total control over your shots: Whip one in over the goalieâs shoulder, bounce one off the ground through trafficâeven go five-hole if youâre really feeling it. Or just unleash a Power Shot to knock over every unlucky defender in your way.â Five increasingly tough levels to tackle: Backyard, High School, College, Pro, and new All-Star.â A full arsenal of unlockable Brine gear helps you up your gameâand your scores.â A built-in, worldwide leaderboard lets you see how you measure up to the best (or donât).â Really light it up? Share your score on Facebook & Twitterâand dare others to beat it.â Made, tested, and played by the brand thatâs been a leader in lacrosse since 1922.HOW TO PLAYâ Once the whistle blows, simply flick up to shoot. Flick direction, speed and distance all have an impact on the placement of your shot.â To keep the clock going, keep scoring. Once youâve scored three goals in a row, every goal adds :01 to your time; once youâve hit 10 in a row, that bonus doubles to :02. Until you missâthen youâre back to square one.â At the bottom-left corner of the screen is your power meter. Every goal and defender you knock down helps fill this up. When itâs completely full, you can perform a Power Shot.â To perform a Power Shot, simply flick down then upâsimilar to how youâd draw a checkmark.â Power Shots can knock over defenders. Each defender you knock down will give you a time bonus that matches what youâre currently receiving for goals (if youâre in the middle of a 10+ goal streak, for example, youâll get :02 for every defender you knock down).",
