    "description": "Use this app to search for books, request and renew books, browse our website, contact a librarian, find reviews, download ebooks, visit our Facebook page, and even use CoverCake, a social media tool that finds books mentioned on television programs, radio shows and blogs.Weâve also included a great new way to search our books. No need to search by field, no need to enter full words, no need to wait for results. Just type the first couple letters of words and see the search in action while you type. So for books on âJacqueline Kennedy Onassisâ simply type âja ke onâ.Weâve invested in the latest mobile solution for libraries and weâll be adding new content over time. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!Sponsored by the Friends of the Kingsport Public Library.",
