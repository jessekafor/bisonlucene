    "description": "Tab is the simple way to split a bill among friends. Snap a pic of the receipt and tap your items to claim them. Tax and tip are calculated for you. No more back-of-the-napkin algebra or typing in prices by hand! Here's how it works:â¢ Take a picture of your receipt to read in all the items and pricesâ¢ Go around the table selecting which items each person ordered; multiple people can select the same item if they shared itâ¢ Tax and tip are automatically divided proportionallyâ¢ If it's someone's birthday, you can split their total evenly among everyone elseâ¢ You can also add the last four digits of each person's credit card number to show your server what amount to put on each card",
