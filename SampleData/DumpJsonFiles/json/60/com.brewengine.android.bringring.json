That wastes some of the time you save by using the app.  Also, reviews below state that some numbers aren\\'t showing up.  I had that problem and I\\'ve found that Bring Ring seems to choke on GV on numbers that are labeled with non alphanumeric characters.  Try changing the labels of the phone numbers to letters only (if they aren\\'t already).  I do recommend it though.  I don\\'t know of another app that performs the same function.",
