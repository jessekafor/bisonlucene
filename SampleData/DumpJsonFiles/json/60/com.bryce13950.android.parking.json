    "description": "My valet is your all in one parking companion, and it is completely free! This app allows you to save your cars location whenever you need to remember where you parked your car. Whenever you need to find your car a map, and a list of directions will lead you to your cars location.Whenever you use a parking meter you can also set when that meter expires. You will then be sent a notification when your parking meter expires. You can also set custom expiration times, so you will be notified whenever is most convenient for you.You will be given a wide variety of options to control the way this application functions.  With the ability to set custom parking meter expiration times also comes the ability to turn off the use of the GPS. By doing this you will be able to use this application for the sole purpose of tracking your parking meter.This application is completely free, but it is ad supported. You can remove all ads for $1.99.",
