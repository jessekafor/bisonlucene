        "comment": "I love the note identification but I wish I could replay the sound.  I take it this may be more geared towards identifying the notes based on the staff location, but I would like more to id them by sound.",

        "comment": "The interface is slow to move to the next question. It started being annoying within a minute of using the app. The interval identification challenge is something that competitors don\\'t usually have, but too simple because it only does C-major.  At least the interface *looks* nice, but that doesn\\'t compensate for the apps poor quality in other aspects.  Please try other apps, they are way better.",
