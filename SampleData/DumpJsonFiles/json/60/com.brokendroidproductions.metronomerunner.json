    "description": "The Metronome Runner App is designed to help runners keep up their pace and speed by running to a metronomic beat in the same way it was designed to help musicians to keep in time with music. It is hoped that this app would improve your running speed and pace by helping the runner keep concentration by listening to the beat.To know what beat you currently run to. Run for 15 minutes at a pace you are comfortable with. During that run count your steps for 1 minute. Do this several times to get an average. Then, refer to the chart on the main screen to determine the BPM you should choose.The media volume of your phone should be set to a low volume so you can hear the beat but that it does not implead (or damage) your hearing.Enjoy this app safely, sensibly and with regard to your own health and Run To The Beat.Key Featuresâ¾Choose between 7 different beats - range from 150bpm to 171bpmâ¾Choose between either minutes per Mile (6-16) or minutes per Kilometres (4-10)â¾View a table of statists in relation to your chosen beat.(see screeshots) â¾Automatically save the last entered choices",
