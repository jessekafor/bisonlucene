    "description": "AVX absolutely blows away Google Now, Siri and every other assistant when it comes to useful features. If you haven't tried it yet what are you waiting for? TRY IT NOW!It's the only assistant that has a dedicated car mode and literally over a hundred more features than the rest. Browse through the command list and you will see that it's no lie that AVX is the leader when it comes to useful features: http://www.eva4android.com/quickstartThis is a free 28 day trial version that has all the same features as the paid version.AVX is a must have app if you want to use voice to increase your productivity. It's like Siri but with so many truly useful functions you will wonder why it doesn't come standard with Android. It includes a dedicated Car Mode that is extremely useful if you want to use your phone while driving. It is the one application that makes your smart phone so much smarter. It includes a powerful Profiles feature that allows you to change loads of settings on your phone in one instant simply by changing the Profile. There are over 30 videos on YouTube (link below) that walk you though every aspect of the application. Take advantage of the free 28 day trial as you cannot possibly try it in a few hours let alone a week. Read the reviews to see what other people are saying and if you like it please tell your family, friends and co-workers.Who should use AVX? If you are looking for an application that provides hands-free operation of your phone then AVX is right for you. If you are just looking for an electronic friend to chat with then please go with one of the Siri clones. On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has extremely useful functions that will make your life easier then give AVX a try.AVX has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never knew were possible. Here is a list of some of the functions that you wont find in most of the competition:â Voice messaging, emails, memos and journals using your own voiceâ Reading and replying to incoming text (incl. Google Voice) and email (incl. Microsoft Exchange)â Reading and replying to incoming instant messages via Google Talkâ Integration with Google+â Integration with Evernoteâ Integration with Taskerâ Home Automation with INSTEON. Turn on the lights and appliances, open the garage door and a whole lot more, all with voice commands or scheduled or based on your location.â Time based reminders. Remind you to do something on a day and/or time.â Location based reminders. Remind you to do something based on your location.â Location based actions. Perform any function that AVX can do based on your current location. Have AVX automatically text your wife when you leave the office.â Time based actions. Perform any function that AVX can do on a set day and timeâ In-Car mode including wake up phrase and fully customizable function buttonsâ Custom voice shortcuts to your phone applications. Give your apps any name you want and open them using that name.â Voice bookmarks to your favorite web sites.â Activate just by shaking your phoneâ Works with all Bluetooth Headsets and most In-Car Bluetooth devicesâ Read and write NFC tags on compatible devicesâ Remote control your phone over Google Talkâ Too many other features to listFor the full online manual please go to:http://www.eva4android.com/avxIf you don't already have a third party text to speech voice that replaces the default Pico voice on your phone I recommend SVOX Classic. Their voices will work with any text to speech app on your device. Download the Free SVOX Classic to demo the voices. AVX is English only. Please don't give 1 star ratings for not having your language.",

So there is no possibility of changing the theoretical size limit? What if I root? I really would like to try and purchase this app. It is unfortunate that you are done with HTC especially with the one coming out. So what are my other options or how can I contact you directly? Going to bump up one star because I can see what it can do, just wish I could install it.",

        "comment": "I just started AVX from using EVAN, which is basically AVX with a different interface.  I still like the EVAN interface for the transparent background, but the overall look on AVX is otherwise more what I prefer.  Anyway, AVX/EVAN is everything I want in a voice assistant app.  Not only does it have an incredible scope of capability beyond any app I\\'ve found, but it\\'s constantly being improved.  It integrates with so many applications it isn\\'t even funny, and it allows a lot of customization that\\'s not available elsewhere.  I did have a few complaints when I first tried EVAN, but they\\'ve been solved through the voice recognition \\\"learning\\\" my voice or the constant updates that add new features almost every week.  Plus, integration with Tasker adds a ton of features for the nerdy folks like me.  I can\\'t believe that a lone individual made an app like this!  I\\'m definitely buying either this or EVAN when the trial is up, not only because it\\'s just all-around amazing, but I have confidence that any complaints I\\'d have with the app will be solved by future updates.  It does have a learning curve, but it\\'s highly entertaining to figure out.",
