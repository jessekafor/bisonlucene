        "comment": "This app was fun to play,  but the poor pictures and somewhat amateur interface distracted from the fun. My advice: focus on making 1 of the games really good,  I say the scavenger hunt. Allow users to pick 1 of the sets instead of getting all 90 items, and work on creating more sets with better graphics. Let users input their own names. Good start! :-)  Ps Thanks for adding Canadian licence plates!",

        "comment": "A better review. The app is too hard to use. I would recommend, to try to improve the app, to try using that app in multiplayer mode and see how impossible it is to scroll through the extremely numerous amount of items to check off what your friends have spotted.  There are so many that you don\\'t even know what to begin to look for. The whole group would have to memorize the list, then someone would also have to know exactly where that item is to check off. It is not feasible to expect any crowd to use that app effectively with one phone. My best advice to make the game so that it is easy and fun to use. Wouldn\\'t take too much effort to figure out how to improve the app.",
