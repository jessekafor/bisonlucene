    "description": "Flying High is a 3D Live Wallpaper using OpenGL that takes you cruising above the clouds in a couple of concept canard aircraft.Fly along the cloud tops doing loops and rolls while you chase your wingman.(This is a wallpaper that takes advantage of the power of the newer devices and will likely not run very well on older devices due to a lack of memory and processor power. There are, however, settings to allow you to choose lower quality textures and remove the animated clouds. If you have a device like a Galaxy S3 it will run great. If it doesn't perform well on your device or crashes go into the settings and lower the Texture Quality setting, then select the wallpaper and restart your phone. If you want to improve the frame rates turn off the Animated Clouds. If you are still unhappy with the performance you can get a refund if you cancel your order within 15 minutes. Please watch the video for more information if you have problems. Thanks, Peter)",

I like the stuff from BulletProof, best of all EVA and, I don\\'t want to see her go. The wall paper is a great live wall paper that does not interfere with the phone or tablet.",
