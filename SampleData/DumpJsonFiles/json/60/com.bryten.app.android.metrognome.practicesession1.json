        "comment": "This app is not good. If you create an app for the sole purpose of loopng beats for rehearsal you gotta care enough to make it right. Whoever said they are an instructor an love this app should refund their students because their recommendations for instructive tools sucks. The uset who wrote about this app dropping beats is mostly right ... What they are wrong about is that nearly every loop drops at least an eighth to sixteenth in 4/4 time. Could be a great app due to having a better variety of beats here",

        "comment": "Xoom 3.2, app is 2.03.   Some patterns hesitate after the measure\\'s last beat going into the next measure\\'s 1st beat : rock_105, rock_120, leadrock_105, leadrock_135, blues_120, blues_145, metro_095 (very, very small delay), now for something weird -- sometimes metro_100 has a delay and other times metro_105 has the delay.    Can\\'t chg time signature...can only select bpm from list, which is adequate. Simple, basic -- very good for beginners, and even useful for veterans when you just need a quick reminder.",
