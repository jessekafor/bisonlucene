        "comment": "This app comes with several great features; you can download your service history from each tires plus store you go to, get maintenance suggestions for your car, and shop around for gas prices. However, there are two things about the app I don\\'t like. One, there\\'s no way to print or download the coupons  it offers so there\\'s no way to use them off your phone. Two, whenever I schedule an appointment through the app the tires plus store never has a record that I schedule the appointment.",

        "comment": "This one saved my bacon this past week while on the road towing a camper. I woke to a low tire pressure warning on the tow vehicle while in an unfamiliar area. I pulled up the app, used the gps to locate the nearest store from Interstate 95 since I had new tires installed just 3 weeks ago and had some issues with the tire sensor. It provided turn by turn directions from where I was pulled over. The weather had been cold in South Georgia and they topped off my air and was on my way in minutes and not a problem since then. Because it also has my maintenance history I can check what all has been done on my car whenever I need to know.",
