        "comment": "Don\\'t disable TalkBack or TTS functions, u lose other functions by doing that such as spoken street names in Google Nav and briefing feature in alarm clock. When u restart ur phone and it activates TalkBack just go into accessibility settings, slide the one for NoLED to \\\"off\\\" and u will see the TalkBack icon disappear from notification bar, then just slide NoLED back to \\\"on\\\" without ever leaving the accessibility screen. U must wait for phone to completely boot or NoLED will restart before it ends TalkBack.",
