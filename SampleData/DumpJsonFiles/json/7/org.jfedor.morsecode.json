It probably works with faster hams and/or clearer signals.",

        "comment": "This app is terrific and works better than my MFJ Pocket CW Reader. There are no controls to tweak, you just turn it on, put it near a radio receiving CW (Morse Code) and it works! It cannot decode weak signals lost in static but if you can get a signal that\\'s stronger than the static, even by a little, it works very well. It does have a tendency to display random characters, especially the \\\"+\\\" and \\\"=\\\" signs when not locked on to a strong signal. Overall, I give it four stars for ease-of-use, accuracy, type and size of font and nice screen display with a little signal strength gauge. It gets a fifth star because it\\'s free! I would be willing to pay for this app and I would highly recommend it to people considering installing it.",

        "comment": "Nice simple, compact app.  Wants to jump up the decode speed too quickly and longer characters end up getting chopped into strings of one and two element characters (E, T, A, N, M, I).   Some \\\"click\\\" and low amplitude discrimination would really polish out the app nicely.  All in all, apps holds some good promise for future development.",

        "comment": "Changing my review. I had tested it using the video here and it just doesn\\'t work consistently at all.  Sure, it got some of the words, but way too many errors.    So my next test was to tune in live morse code.  When I ran the app, you could see the white waveform \\\"hearing\\\" the audio.  You can see the red line adjusting itself up and down.  Then after a few seconds, the white waveform just disappears and the red line moves to the bottom of its display area (below what would have been the white waveform).    That\\'s it.  It no longer works.  I have to exit the program and go back in for it to ALMOST work for a few seconds.    But again,  it was mostly picking up gibberish.  The odd \\\"QC\\\", the odd \\\"TEST\\\" could be seen.      Too bad though.  If this app worked properly, it would be exactly what I was looking for.    It does need some options for users to tweak:  -  band pass filter adjustment  -  mic level adjustment (auto or selectable variable slider)  -  keep working and don\\'t stop",
