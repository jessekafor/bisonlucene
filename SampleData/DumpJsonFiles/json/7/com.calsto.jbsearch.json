This app contains a search widget pack that clones the official search bar found in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.

We have no control over the searches and can not see them. They are controlled from the stock Google search app. For more information regarding the widgets or search, please view Google's privacy policy online at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ These search widgets will work on all stock and 3rd party launchers including ADW, Launcher Pro, Trebuchet, Jelly Bean Launcher, ICS Launcher, HC Launcher, Nova, Apex, GO, Holo, etc.Avast reporting as malware?! No it's not malware, it is the AdNetwork's SDK which has been certified by Verisign and fully approved by Google. Avast and a few other outdated scanners will mark this as a potential risk because of the required permissions. Don't be fooled, use a scanner with legitimate identifiers like Lookout Security or AVG. Read the privacy policy located on our website or send us an email for more info.Then why are there so many permissions? Well, most are required for the stock search controls. The others are necessary for our AdNetwork's SDK and are explained in more detail here - http://www.startapp.com/permissions/. All permissions added are completely harmless and at no point do we collect or store any personal information! Our user's privacy is a top priority, but please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.â¨This app provides a few useful shortcuts on your device in the form of a search bookmark link and home screen icon. This gives us a few cents each time the app is downloaded for the first time and will help us out a lot in developing more apps. If you do not want to use these new tools, you can simply ignore or delete them by dragging the icon to the trashcan and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it). Thank you!If you have any questions or comments, please visit our website or send us an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible!Google, Android, and Jelly Bean 4.1 are trademarks of Google, Inc.",
