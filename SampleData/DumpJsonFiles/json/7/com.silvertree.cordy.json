        "comment": "The trial was far too short for me to decide if it would be worth it BUT even that didn\\'t make me angry like the fact that after level 4 it asked me to buy the game.  I declined & it took me to the level menu.  It wouldn\\'t let me escape.  It kept saying my purchase has been canceled when I hit the x.  It was continuing to try accessing the purchase menu.  How shady can you be?  That\\'s way too easy for someone to accidentally click Yes in the mess of trying to close out the game.  Sorry is what it is.",

The level design is only so-so; there are too many decision points for a game that asks for exhaustive exploration. As opposed to Sonic, its most obvious reference, which generally has no incentive for exploration and is more fun for that decision.",
