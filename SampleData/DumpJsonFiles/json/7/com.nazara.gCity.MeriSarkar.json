    "description": "We often feel tempted to the power and fame that politicians have, but helpless when it comes to defining rules for our own lives and the world around.  This game allows us to build our own political party, select candidates, contest elections, accumulate votes, choose development plans, support other parties and a lot more. Letâs play and rule the parliament with the accompanied fun of commanding over politicians and directing their actions.",
