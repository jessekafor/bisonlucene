So far, I feel that the pro is worth it but I\\'m curious to see if I still feel that way in 6 months or a year. I have some suggestions for the programs. I wish that each set lasted closer to 30 minutes instead of 10. Also, I would like for each program session to include warm-up poses and cool-down or relaxation poses. The sets seem too abrupt in their start and finish. With these changes, I would go up to 5 stars.",

Sometimes you switch between laying down and then you need to be stood up without flowing from one to the next with a joining posture. It works great on my htc desire however the screen is small. I installed it on my samsung galaxy tab 2 10\\\" however it will not play any routines and just crashes, which is a shame.  Very useful app with good free content. Adverts are not too intrusive and cancel with one click.",
