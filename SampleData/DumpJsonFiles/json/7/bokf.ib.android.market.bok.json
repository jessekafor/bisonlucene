        "comment": "The app is good. It\\'s pretty stable, and works as advertised. One annoying thing is that if you leave the app without explicitly logging out, it will suddenly pop up in 10 minutes to tell you it logged you out. That\\'s a good thing from an account security perspective, but if I go back to the app before the 10 minutes is up I have to reenter my password as if I were logged out. Why not automatically log me out when I leave the app? Also, I wish it had a check register feature that would reconcile transactions as they clear. BOK is slow about posting transactions to my account (especially things like credit card payments or drafts to accounts outside of the bank), so I never trust the balance given online. It would be handy if I didn\\'t have to keep a separate check register.",
