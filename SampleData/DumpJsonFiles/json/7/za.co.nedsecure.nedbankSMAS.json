        "comment": "The app works most of the time and I am very happy with the banking facilities that I make use of. There are issues with securing a connection over certain WiFi networks and the app seems to force you into offline mode when it can\\'t connect (the offline mode is an empty screen). Why even offer such an option?! I think this app shows a lot of potential and can become great.",

        "comment": "I installed the app when it was first launched, in general it seemed to work well and I have no complaints however, the app no longer works and the login / banking icon has now been replaced by an \\\"Upgrade Notification\\\" Icon which simply states that the app is being upgraded and has been like this for months. I am also not able to access the https Netbank site from my phone, have even tried installing another browser but have the same issue! As it stands I am unable to do any banking whatsoever from my mobile device which is somewhat frustrating!   An organisation the size of Nedcor should\\'t have issues like this and to be frank I find it pretty poor on their part, their banking app was late to get to the market and only functional for a short while before it was withdrawn.",

        "comment": "I really enjoy the functionality provided by this app, but there is one major problem for me. I use this app as a means of doing my banking faster than I would in a browser, but instead it takes a lot longer because every single screen requires loading. I myself am studying interface design and I can easily say that this single problem makes the interface far too frustrating for me to want to use the app. If I want to purchase airtime, I have to wait for the screen to load, then I have to wait to select my service provider, wait to select the type of service I want to purchase and then wait once I have confirmed the transaction. Something definitely needs to be done about this, because banking apps are becoming the norm and if the app isn\\'t good enough, customers are going to get very frustrated.",

Poor service from them and seemingly un-phased that this service does not work, yet are surprised when customers are unhappy.",
