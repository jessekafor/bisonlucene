Why the difference in implementation?  example:  iPad: Tournament info is a \\\"pop up\\\" with your current table running in the background.  Nexus 7: Tournament info goes to a completely different screen with the table action muted AND it forces you to portrait mode so you have to turn your stupid tablet???  wth?  There\\'s only one way to make up for this.  Make Pokerstars compatible with Chromecast.  With the bet controls on the tablet and the tables on the big screen TV!  :)",
