We're unsure why as we have no control over the app install process. This results in the app not opening or not being able to save your game. Uninstalling and reinstalling is the only workaround.- The max level is 100.- Sharing sometimes causes a force close. We're still investigating.- If you are getting a \"not enough space\" error when trying to install our application, go to Menu->Settings->Manage Applications->Market and tap on the \"Clear Cache\" button and try again.- We're still battling the force-closes. We will not give up the fight.Keywords: aquarium, live wallpaper, panda, pets, fishing, aquarium wallpaper, fish tank, free games, casual games, free wallpaper, fishing game, free live wallpaper, bionic panda",

        "comment": "I love this game but with the new update there are ads on the fishing screen and they move and sometimes I miss the fish because it is disorienting. I understand the need for ads but can you please put them somewhere else so it does not interfere with fishing? I don\\'t want to waste bait. So I\\'m not going to bother with rainbow pellets anymore until this issue is resolved.",
