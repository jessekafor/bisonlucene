    "description": "Kashmiri Radios app. Kashmiri is a language from the Dardic sub-group and it is spoken primarily in the Kashmir Valley, in Jammu and Kashmir. There are approximately 5,527,698 speakers throughout India, according to the Census of 2001. Most of the 105,000[citation needed] speakers or so in Pakistan are Ã©migrÃ©s from the Kashmir Valley after the partition of India. They include a few speakers residing in border villages in Neelum District.The Kashmiri language is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India, and is a part of the Sixth Schedule in the constitution of the Jammu and Kashmir. Along with other regional languages mentioned in the Sixth Schedule, as well as Hindi and Urdu, the Kashmiri language is to be developed in the state. Some Kashmiri speakers frequently use Hindi as a second language, though the most frequently used second language is Urdu. Since November 2008, the Kashmiri language has been made a compulsory subject in all schools in the Valley up to the secondary level.(à¤à¥à¤¶à¥à¤°, Ú©Ø£Ø´ÙØ± Koshur)",
