    "description": "\"This had to be one of the most creative apps I have reviewed...\" -Android Authority, Jan 2012INTRODUCTION:Control over personal information is your universal human right and PlaceMask Location Privacy for Androidâ¢ assists you in maintaining location privacy against threats accessing your GPS and Network location (e.g. location-based advertising and profiling apps).We are focused on delivering technologies that reduce location leakage from on-board GPS and Wireless Network location sources to protect your privacy. Your mobile carrier may still know where you are (roughly) but the applications on your device will not be able to use your GPS or Network location without your permission. If you want to anonymize your country (for apps like Netflix that look up your location from IP address), consider also using a proxy network.We also recognize a number of other uses for this technology when combined with your location-based apps (e.g. including virtual tourism and misrepresentation). You will find this a useful companion to: Angry Birds and Carrier IQ (privacy), Wikitude and Google Places (tourism), or Facebook and Foursquare (spoofing).To learn more about the ways your location is determined and what you can do to stop it, please visit our website at http://www.PlaceMask.com KEY FEATURES:â¢ Three privacy settings (minimum, medium, maximum) that monitor settings, replace real location, and randomize movement to enhance privacyâ¢ Scans applications on your device and reports those that use your location with context menu convenience functionsâ¢ Provides a status view of your \"current\" location and the policies in forceâ¢ Runs as a resident service that always watches for location leakageâ¢ Easy unmasking to use real location when you need it (e.g. simply tap the PlaceMask to start and stop)â¢ Trial period lasts 15 days (360 hours)QUICK TEST:Activate PlaceMask service at the medium privacy level then switch to another location-based app to view your device in a new location.FUNCTIONALITY:PlaceMask Location Privacy for Androidâ¢ is an application that protects your location privacy. It monitors the location settings of your device and provides replacement locations to the other applications to enhance your privacy. You may view the current status of the application through key settings overlaid onto a map view. You may access a list of alerts related to the operation of the application or retrieve a report of all the applications on your device that use your location in some way. The settings in PlaceMask Location Privacy allow you to adjust application parameters like privacy levels. You may find general information about the application, its license, and its authors in the about dialog. And of course, we have provided an easy way for you to recommend PlaceMask Location Privacy to a friend or colleague by launching a text message from the application.CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE:You are the most important part of this software and we believe usability is a key attribute to its success. If you find anything that you do not understand or is difficult to learn, remember, or use efficiently - please let us know. Your satisfaction is our objective.REFUNDS AND SUPPORT:Comments in the Market are not the most effective way to get support (but we love great reviews!). If you have an issue, please send a report to support@placemask.com with the following information: summary of problem, platform description, expected behavior, observed behavior, and steps to reproduce the problem. If we are not able to satisfactorily address your issue, we are happy to provide a refund.APPEAL FOR FREEDOMSoftware Products that assist you in preserving privacy are important to maintaining personal freedom.

Phone is unlocked and is Android 2.2 (Froyo), currently using an Italian \\\"WIND\\\" mobile sim card in Italy.  I tried to access NetFlix android app and the NetFlix says I can\\'t use it in Italy.  So whatever this app is doing it doesn\\'t spoof my location for NetFlix.  I\\'m not sure how NetFlix knows where I am.  I assume it is by my cell/data carrier and not simply by GPS location.  If that is what is going on it makes sense the NetFlix isn\\'t working even with PlaceMask running.",
