If you plan to give bad ratings because of this lack of feature, please go away and DO NOT download!This app suffers from people that do not read app description.This is simply IMPOSSIBLE. If you want so, I know many apps that inspect your CPU every second or memory and that really drains your battery, you will easily find such apps, but definitely not mine.When tracking my battery usage, I was always missing something...That information was the Battery drain in percent per hour.I just made this app for my personal use and it's now time to share it.This app will always sleep and wake up every time your battery drop one percent to save the current battery state and the time. On the next battery drop, I will compute the battery drain.I plan to work on the User interface and improve it during next weeks/month, feel free to contact me if you have suggestion/ideas.Keep in mind that this app has to stay simple and minimalist.",

        "comment": "There is plenty of good in knowing that your battery is draining faster. Having had battery problems in the past, I install apps one by one and check each app introduces no new problems. The method of this app should (hopefully) mean there is minimal battery drain. If you want a list of what apps are draining your battery then install something else, but don\\'t expect those other battery apps to include themselves in the list of high drainers ... which they should, because they are.  So if you don\\'t get it and don\\'t ready the description, just walk on by rather than leave an unfair bad review.  To the author ... have you thought about notifications if battery drain exceeds a certain threshold, like mine does for no apparent reason every now and then? This could then be picked up by an app such as Llama which could reboot the phone overnight ....",

Things that are not there and certainly welcome.  1. Graphs are more easy to read compared to the list in Battery drain screen. 2. The list doesn\\'t refresh itself. Everytime you have to go back and come again to refresh. 3. The summary window is not clear. Temporal Partition !! What?? 4. After exporting the data in a csv, I think you should give an option to the user to either see it directly, if possible or share it over an email.",
