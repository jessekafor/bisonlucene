The dinosaur puzzles are particularly good, because they\\'ve really reinforced her command of the alphabet.  It\\'s well worth the in-app purchase to get all the puzzles.",

        "comment": "My kids really like this game.  The app is free for the first couple puzzles, but will cost more to unlock all the puzzles.  It\\'s kind of nice that you don\\'t have to buy a separate app like those apps with Lite versions.  They have a slick little math question that keeps your kid from accidentally buying the extra puzzles.  However, there is no option to turn off the \\\"more games\\\" button at the bottom, which opens a browser instead of the app store, so my kids hit that all the time and get stuck in the web browser.  For an app that tries to be so slick by preventing accidental clicks, you\\'d think that I could turn off that button.",
