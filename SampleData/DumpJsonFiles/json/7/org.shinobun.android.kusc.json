I did that so the music keeps going, and doesn't stop.  I guess it would be a better idea to make it an option, so the user can choose what they want.---Hello Joseph (February 20, 2012), thank you for commenting!Thank you for the clarification on the favorites feature.  I'll see what I can do.---Current features:- Listen to KUSC.  From the menu, select Play.- Real time playlist.  Updates every minute, or by pressing the Refresh button.- Retrieve special program information.- Shop Online at ArkivMusic.com.  A portion of every purchase made goes to support KUSC!- Choose audio quality.  From the menu, select Settings.This is an open source app, and source code is available upon request.",
