This app modifies the standard calendar exactly as I want it.   Firstly, when a reminder comes up, it \\\"bongs\\\" gently every minute until you do something about it, so you can\\'t just let it slip past, then, when you do decide to do something about it, you have a vast number of options for how long to snooze for if that\\'s what you want.   Perfect.  No sign in my version of the complaints by Pete on June 7th, or jjmac on July 12th. Looks like they were fioxed as requested.",
