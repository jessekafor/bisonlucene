        "comment": "I find that I get the most value out of Familiar by using it as an automatically-updated photo frame for my phone and tablet. What I usually do is dock my nexus 7 in its dock, and Familiar starts up automatically. It refreshes itself with the latest photos from my family and gives me a glimpse of what\\'s going on in their lives. The new format is harder to navigate \\\"on-demand\\\", but I look forward to that being fixed going forward.",

However the interaction for browsing new pictures is really complicated and seems broken. Clicking on the polaroid of recent activity shows only 1 picture of all the added pictures and there is no way in browsing to the other pictures in that set.   I also try to delete the sample channel, but it returns all the time. For sure they need to do some work on the interaction, but I didn\\'t find anything comparable that could be easy for not so technical people.   The slideshow works ok.",
