Eye muscles should be trained often for winning your eyesight back (eye test). You will see, it will be like one of the eye games.About our eye: Eyes are organs that detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. The simplest photoreceptors in conscious vision connect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals.Visual acuity, or resolving power, is \"the ability to distinguish fine detail\" and is the property of cone cells. It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.Color vision is the faculty of the organism to distinguish lights of different spectral qualities. All organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum; this varies from creature to creature, but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm.An eye handbook might help you for more info about the eye (or eye tracking).  Pro version is like an eye magic app with 8 new trainings including dominant eye recognition and an eye color blindness test! An eye quiz with exciting eye illusions will be added later!",
