The guts of the app are fine for my use, but sounds like they need some work, and the appearance could use a little work also. Improve on this and could be worth selling at the low price of a buck.",

Having the ability to pick which media app I want my specific media file to open in is a plus but having to browse by individual file rather than through a list isn\\'t so practical. Also, the lack of thumbnails makes knowing which photo I\\'m opening difficult. Overall this app works well for the most but needs an overhaul, design and feature wise. Keep up the good work and you\\'ll have a solid product",
