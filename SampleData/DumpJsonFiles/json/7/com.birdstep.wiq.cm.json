    "description": "WiQ helps you as a Telia customer to have a really good WiFi experience. Did you know that most subscriptions at Telia include WiFi-data as well? Furthermore, data over WiFi is not limited in amount of data or speed. This means that you can surf the internet in full speed for \"free\" at all Telia hotspots in Sweden. In addition there are plenty of partner-WiFi providers available when you are travelling, which mostly comes with a cost of usage. WiQ helps you manage all of this and more. WiQ makes sure that you get a username and password to the hotspots, automatically. And it also helps you to transparently connect to these hotspots when they are available. WiQ also remembers where and when you need to use different WiFi, for instance at home or at work and turns WiFi on or off automatically when entering or leaving these places. This way WiQ can conserve battery power and simultaneously make sure that data is sent over WiFi instead of over an expensive 3G/4G connection. Naturally you can always check in WiQ how much data you have saved by using the app. WiQ also measures the quality of the data connection in order to help create a better user experience and to be able to find the network which has the highest quality at any given time.",
