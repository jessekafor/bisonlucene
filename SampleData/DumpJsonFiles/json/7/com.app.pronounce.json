    "description": "Pronounce is an app for Android that lets you become a variety of political figures: from activists to communists. Your job is to dictate your speech as clearly as possible. If you pronounce the speech correctly, you leave the podium with applause. If you mispronounce the speech, you are mobbed by the angry crowd. The free version contains Martin Luther's famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and President Obama's Inaugural Address. Upgrade to the Ad-Free version to remove the ads. The full version with over three full speeches is coming soon.",
