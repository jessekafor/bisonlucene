I did not see anything else that differentiate the basic from the pro/ paid version. Sometimes looses album images. Can not seem to make new playlists in basic. Pressing the playlist buttons on the screen with no playlist loaded causes a force close.",

BUT the equalizer is truly the worst amongst alternatives. The bass and  treble sound too artificial to be tolerable. I\\'m sticking to version 2 until DSM support or a better equalizer is added.",
