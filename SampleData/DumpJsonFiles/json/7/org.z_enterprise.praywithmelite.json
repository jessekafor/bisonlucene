    "description": "RAMADAN MUMBARAKA unique tool to aid in learning, memorising and pronouncing the Arabic surah's (verse's) that are recited while preforming salat/salah (prayer) and aims to increase the userâs repertoire of various suras. It has a colourful, simple interface and features. It is designed for: children, adults; new converts; reverts who wish to learn the Arabic recitation of while performing salat - the app assumes the user has a basic knowledge of salat positions - (in version 2 those will be incorporated).The app is your own personal Islamic teacher, mentor, parent or an Imam, vocalising the full salat - even the parts that are recited in silence. While actually preforming salat. Plus there are 3 suraâs to choose from in this Lite version (there are 37 surah's in the full paid version - currently on special offer), which are brand new vocal recordings by Sheikh Ayman Mohamed Ayyash Hashim, a Qadi and Imam and Khateeb of Jama Masjid Baseerah, Jeddah Saudi Arabia. The LITE version just has the Maghrib slaat option enabled. Through the purchase of this application, a percentage of the proceeds from the sale are being automatically donated to Islamic Charities throughout the world.* This app is not meant to be used as a replacement to the prescribed Muslim sunna of how salat is performed. Only to be used as a teaching/learning tool.RAMADAN PROMOTION:Full Piad Version Of Pray With Me On Sale Price For A Litmited Period 66% Of Normal Store Price._____________________________________________________________________________________________THE INSPIRATION FOR THE APP: came from personal experiences and family members.1: Their are parts of the Salat that are recited silently. This app recites all parts audibly. 2: A family member is dyslexic, finds memorising short and long pieces of text (surahs) very difficult. Used to use a book perched in front of him while praying.3: My 13 year-old niece wishes to learn the Salat -  wishes to do so in her own time and method.In all three examples - this app has helped address their needs.",
