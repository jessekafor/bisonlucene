    "description": "Find My Phone is the solution if you want to make sure you know where your phone is at any time. You can also make sure your spouse and kidsâ phones havenât been misplaced!How the app works:1) Install the Find My Phone app on your phone2) Create an account 3) Provide the cell # for the personâs phone youâd like to 4) Weâll send a text message to the number, asking for approval (this is required by the cell phone carriers for security)5) As soon as the person receives the text invite and replies yes, you can locate their phone any time you want with the push of a button How do we locate phones?You may have heard of âtriangulationâ on TV shows such as CSI or Law & Order. This is how the app works in real life, too! Cell phone companies have the location of a cell phone, as they know its distance from a cell phone tower. We buy this secure data from the cell phone companies and display it to you on our mapTrack any Android phone or iPhone or free with our app:If the people you would like to track have either an Android phone or iPhone, you can track the phone directly through the app for free. However, the app needs to be installed on both your phone and the phone of the person you want to locate.Upgrade available for other types of phones:If you, your family member(s) or friend(s) are not using a smartphone, we only provide 3 locations for free (afterwards, you can upgrade to a $4.99 per month premium plan to locate any cell phone an unlimited number of times). This fee is because we have to pay the cell phone companies per location we look up for you.Find My Phone is the most battery safe Android app for lost or stolen phones. Using smarter GPS technology, Find My Phone provides highly accurate locations for lost or stolen devices, and will work on any Android device.Find My Phone can provide navigation to your lost or stolen Android device! Simply use a family memberâs phone â and locate the missing Droid. As long as the location app is running, you will be able to see the location of your lost or stolen phone, and will be able to launch navigation from within the app. Most common uses:Locating a lost phone, locating a friend, finding a friend, tracking a family member, locating each other on trips, avoid getting lost on trips or events, locating of husband/wife (spouse tracking), locating of children/kids, tracking kids on trips or daily activities such as going to the mall, or just locate someone for fun or get peace of mind.Carriers who support this app:Verizon, T-mobile, Sprint and AT&TPhone devices that support this app:Resarch In Motion (Blackberry), Haier, Huawei, Nokia, Benefon, Fujitsu / Toshiba, Mitsubishi, NEC, Panasonic, Sanyo, Sony Ericsson, Sharp, LG, Samsung, Acer, Asus, BenQ, Foxconn, HTC, Sendo, Apple, Dell, Garmin, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Palm, Sonim and moreOS that support this app:Symbian, Palm, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, iOS, Android, Rim, WebOS and all other common OS",
