It's still beta but we're getting there.PERMISSIONS: Please see Wiki page on Google code before rating down because of private data access. This app is open source after all.HONEYCOMB USERS:Please note that this app is now available to Honeycomb tablets, but it's far from optimized. We're working on that.VOLUME:Use the hardware buttons of your phone while the remote is running.INSTALLATION:There is a complete and updated installation guide in the Wiki, featured on the front page of the website.BUGS:Please use the forum or the bugtracker. Comments in here are read sporadically but more for amusement than for serious debugging.",
