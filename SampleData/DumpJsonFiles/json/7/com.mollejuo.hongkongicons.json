    "description": "Hong Kong is rich in history, use this app to discover it through your phone camera viewer, painless and easily. Great aid for walking tours (sort of Google Glass experience, without the glasses). *Requirements*: Layar app *MUST* be installed on your phone in order for Hong Kong Icons to work. Also, notice this app will *only* function where you & your phone device are located within the Hong Kong geographical area.",
