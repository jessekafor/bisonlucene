    "description": "Hashi Bridges is a mentally challenging and addictive logic puzzle game. Known in Japan as Hashiwokakero by Nikoli (known for sudoku). Connect islands by bridges using skill and logic. It's not as simple as it sounds! ***This version has been replaced by Hashi Bridges FREE 1.3 and Hashi Bridges PRO 1.3 - check out the 'More from Developer' links*** We strongly recommend that either of these are installed rather than this one. We have added some exciting new features that YOU guys suggested and requested. Due to technical reasons this version will no longer be supported. Thank you!",
