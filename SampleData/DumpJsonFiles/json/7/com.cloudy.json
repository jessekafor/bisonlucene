    "description": "Where's It Cloudy? is an Android application that shows real-time satellite data from the American Geostationary Weather Satellites. As a mobile phone app, you may access it to find out where it's cloudy in the vicinity of where you are located, or anywhere in the eastern and central United States and southern Canada. Most other weather apps do not show satellite imagery; they only show radar data. Radar data is effective at showing where there is rain and snow, but it doesn't show where clouds are located. Currently the App will NOT show imagery covering the West Coast.The satellite data shown in Where's It Cloudy? is ideal for several purposes including:* showing cloudy regions* detecting the likelihood of precipitation* helping track moderate to severe storms and hurricanes* showing the movement, rotation, and structure of storms* display of images in a time-lapsed loop.Traditional weather applications show imagery covering only predefined areas at predefined resolutions. Where's It Cloudy? goes beyond this to allow the user to choose a default viewing point anywhere in North America, and a viewing altitude that determines the area the image will cover. A cloud computing platform renders the data based on your selections. The Cloud for Clouds!!Once you set your default location and altitude, the image loops are dynamically generated at the maximum possible resolution from a 3D model of the Earth with the real time satellite imagery overlaid on this realistic model. This provides stunning and accurate visuals, especially in the Visible channel of satellite data.Unlike other programs that may show the satellite imagery in a few shades at a reduced level of detail Where's it cloudy shows satellite imagery in full detail and in as many shades as are possible on your device.   We also do not use lossy compression to preserve as much detail as possible.  If you select Tru-Sat Image it will show the raw satellite image as it  was imaged from the satellite which in many cases can show much more detail.   Give it a try you will be impressed.",
