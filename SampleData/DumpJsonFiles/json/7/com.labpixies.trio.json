        "comment": "and perhaps the 4G LTE service may have something to do with this app having issue. Before it would let you move column of balls dropping to any column you chose. On DROID razr it goes so fast yet you don\\'t have a chance to do anything or should I say it is that you can not. Every time it immediately goes straight to the bottom of the center column which is where it enters. You only get about three drops of three balls and it is all over. What has happened because now it is no longer fun to play. It was good little app to play a few games waiting maybe or to take your thoughts away from something and to kill a few minutes. Am I doing anything wrong? Please fix this if possible or it will no use to me on the phone I have and so I am considering an uninstall. So sorry, but it sure was fun before.@\\tI have had this for a couple of years and other Lab Pixies games. It used to be fun because you could kill some time if you were waiting or wanted to take your mind off something else.",
