    "description": "Flashify lets you share a url from a browser without Flash support to another browser that has Flash.This app does not include Flash, it just makes Flash easier to access after it's installed.I wrote it because I was annoyed that Chrome Beta doesn't support Flash and likely never will. This lets you easily switch to another browser that does support Flash without awkwardly copying and pasting the url.Flashify doesn't have to be used for Flash, it is useful for anyone that wants to switch browsers quickly on the same website.It has been tested with Chrome Beta, Browser (default), Dolphin HD, Firefox, Opera Mobile and should work in all browsers via the Share option. To use Flashify, open your favorite browser, press Menu->Share->Flashify.  Look at the screenshots to see how it works visually.THIS APP WON'T SHOW UP IN THE APP DRAW OR THE DESKTOP. It only adds an option to the SHARE MENU IN YOUR BROWSER.If you can't figure out how Flashify works, please email me and I will explain further. I can't respond to comments!Flashify is open sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/GodsMoon/FlashifySpecial thanks to Jose Cordoba for the new name and Rob Wilson for the video review and explanation.",

        "comment": "This is such a simple idea. I like the original name \\\"Another Browser\\\" better, but I understand why the author changed it. I\\'m not using it for Chrome/Flash issues, but I\\'ve had plenty of cases where a page doesn\\'t work correctly in the browser I\\'m in and I want to open it in a different browser and this serves that purpose perfectly. Thanks for the app.",
