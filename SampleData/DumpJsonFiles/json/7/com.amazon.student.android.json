        "comment": "In regard to the trade in feature: Selling unopened new DVDs is worth it because of the absence of shipping costs and wait time on the seller\\'s part. Like new and Good DVDs are not worth the effort or trade in value. Books, only college level, required and current for this semester are worth the trade in value. Any book that isn\\'t a textbook or is a remotey old textbook, is not worth even scanning. If you have these very precise goods, use this app.",
