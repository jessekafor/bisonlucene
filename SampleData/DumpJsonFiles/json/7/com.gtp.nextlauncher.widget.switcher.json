Reboot is an obvious one, but it\\'s happened a few times a day without any reboot or other system event.  Using it with Next 3D launcher on my HTC One with Android 4.1.2.  I want to keep it but it\\'s aggravating to have to keep re-setting the layout and switches all the time.  Will get 5 stars when this is fixed!",
