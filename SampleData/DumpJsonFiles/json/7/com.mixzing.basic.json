        "comment": "I\\'ve tried most media players on play and this is the only one I stayed with.  With the new update media from across the web is available easily at your fingertips.  This app even has widget players for your home screen.  Best of all, it has a folder view that doesn\\'t just cram all my music together via tags.  My only complaints... the widget control buttons disappear and when I shuffle all the player shuffles in the same order every time.  UPDATE... shuffle still shuffles songs in the same order",

Instead of selecting one album at a time or one artist or one genre at a time being able to select more than one of those and adding them to playlists would be a reliever for organizing music.",
