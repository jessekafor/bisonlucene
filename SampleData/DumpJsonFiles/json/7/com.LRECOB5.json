Try this Life Recorder, to record your life from now.The recorder had been revived in the 20th century, which is not only in the pursuit of historically informed performance of early music, but also because of its suitability as a  rather simple instrument for teaching music and its appeal to  some amateur players. Nowadays, it is often thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many professional players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range. The sound of the recorder is  extraordinarily clear and sweet, partly because of lack of upper harmonics and predominance of odd harmonics in the sound.-----------More info------------I hope you like this app, or like this version, it's my happy~~~ This app is free free free!
