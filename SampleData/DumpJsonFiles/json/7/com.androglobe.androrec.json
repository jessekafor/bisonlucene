    "description": "Now download previous versions of Androrec from http://yorkerapps.com/#tab-2â¢ Please do not keep other call recorders active when Androrec is enabled. Otherwise Androrec will fail to record your calls.â¢ For Galaxy S2 users - It has been reported that once upgraded to android 4.0.3, Androrec no more works in mode 3, it will record in mode 1 from Mic only. Please don't rate badly. It is not the fault of Androrec.â¢ Please test the different recording modes to see which mode works best for you. Mode 3 is recommended for Samsung Galaxy S2 users having android version less than 4.0.â¢ For Motorola users -  I request you kindly don't give bad ratings as the problem is with Motorola hardware not with AndroRec call Recorder.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AndroRec is a very light weight yet powerful call recorder for android phones that records all your incoming and out going calls automatically to your SD card (External Storage).Features :â¢ Absolutely free and ad freeâ¢ Records all incoming and outgoing callsâ¢ Option to enable/disable call recordingâ¢ No time limit for recordingâ¢ Log of all the recorded calls can be viewed from the application. You can play or delete or archive recordings from the application itselfâ¢ Log shows the contact number/name, exact date time as well as duration of your call making it easy to track all your calls from the applicationLimitations :â¢ Can't record calls from Bluetoothâ¢ May not record the opposite side voice in some phones due to hardware limitationsNote : In Some phones the tone from the other side of the call might be a little low. If so, please enable speaker phone to get a clearer recording. This is a limitation from Android OS and the device manufacturers and has nothing to do with AndroRec call recorder. The recorded audio files can be found in your SD card in androrec folder.Please leave a comment or drop a mail to support@yorkerapps.com if you find any problem with the application. Remember to include your device model, android version and the problem you are facing.",

Still with that being set up it WILL NOT work UNLESS you put it on speakerphone.  YES you have to put your phone on speaker for it to work!   Being that you have to tweak it a certain way for the app to work I\\'ve given it a 4STAR rating because this is MAYBE the 1 out of too many phonecall recording apps that ACTUALLY WORK!",
