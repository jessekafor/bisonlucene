MeloDroid can also automatically pause iTunes when you receive a call, and resume when the call ends.The MeloDroid app requires a Windows application to run (which you can download for free at http://melodroid.com ), just like many other apps that sync Android and iTunes. However, MeloDroid is packed with features that sets it apart from the rest. The MeloDroid Windows application includes (but is not limited to) the following features:- Convert your iTunes music to MP3's- Restore playlists you accidentally deleted in iTunes- Find and remove broken tracks in iTunes- Display iTunes song notificationsUnlike DoubleTwist, you do not need to install a separate media player.

        "comment": "I purchased this app to sync my podcasts to my nexus 7 (2013).  The sync seems to get a few songs, but mostly gives errors on music and podcasts.  It seems to work fine as a remote, but there are many free apps for that.  I would not recommend this app.   If it can be fixed I\\'ll be happy, otherwise I\\'d prefer a refund.  I wish I didn\\'t spend all the time trying to get to work.  15 minutes may be too short a window for refunds...",

Either the desktop app crashes or the mobile app gives an error in syncing files with itunes. Wrote to the vendor, who promises a 24 hour response. There has been no revert for over a week now. Shitty app. DO NOT BUY.  Is there a way by which i can claim a refund?",

The one user said to clear the phone cache.  I\\'ve looked, my Galaxy Prevail does not seem to have users accessible cache settings. I just want a music manager/player for Android that works and is either small or can move to the SD card.  DoubleTwist was nice, but it is too huge.  I only have 161 mb of internal storage.",
