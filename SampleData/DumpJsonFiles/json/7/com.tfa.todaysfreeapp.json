        "comment": "Like others, I have found that most of these apps are already being offered for free. More importantly, the apps have all been useless so far.   Amazon has been offering a free app every day for over two years, and they\\'ve done a much better job at it. Amazon offers a wide variety of free apps such as games, books for young children, specialty apps, phone customization apps, etc. Google\\'s apps have all pretty much been the same--apps where the community shares info so users know where to get the best food, concerts, etc.  One last thing that doesn\\'t quite measure up to the way Amazon offers their free app--there is no reason this even needs to be a separate app from the Play Store! Why not just offer the free app on the Play Store? You should simply open up the Play Store and see a new offer every day on the home page. Then you can download it from there and be done. It\\'s silly to have a separate app that wastes precious on-board memory on your phone, then have it link to a different app where you do the actual downloading.",
