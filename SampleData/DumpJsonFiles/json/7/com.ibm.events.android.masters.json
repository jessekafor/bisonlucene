Edit: 4/12/13.....Still no live stream!!!  And the radio, you can barely hear it....Warp, rooted, stacked, jacked, and over clocked.  Edit: After update now have live stream. As promised now 5 stars. Every thing now working perfectly.Edit: Was working now constant buffering and having to restart video. I am home now on wifi, VIOS, will hate to see it on 3g if it buffers like this on wifi. Back to 1 star. Working much better now after running it for awhile. 4 stars. Worst piece of crap. On start up video buffers, have to restart, Trying to watch now for 20 min it sucks. Worked yesterday not today.Back to 1 star.",
