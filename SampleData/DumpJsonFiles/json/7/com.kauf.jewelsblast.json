Play it every time you wish to kill some time!Origins of the game:Match Three is one of the oldest casual game mechanics. Though his recent simplified incarnations as a computer and mobile game has given it renewed popularity, the origins as a board game date back to Roman times. The game survived the fall of Rome in the halls of monasteries throughout Europe. The monks built game boards on tops of hogsheads using beans and peas as the pieces. It is thanks to the monasteries that the game survives today, via its introduction to students at Oxford and Cambridge. The game was exported to America in the 1600âs by professors coming from England to Harvard. It used to be considered a gentlemanâs game but after the War for Independence the game spread among the egalitarian masses in the newly minted USA. How the ancient match three became an electronic game is history but all the match -3 games we play today all owe their roots to the game played by Caesar.",
