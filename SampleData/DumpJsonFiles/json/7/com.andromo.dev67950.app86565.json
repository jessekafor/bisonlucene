Just talk and Elmit will answer, ... any time!Talk about any think you like, your school, your parents, your kids, your wife, .. Elmit is listening and answers to any subjects you like, regardless if it is your friend Janet, Peter or your math or science teacher or if it is a problem you push ahead of you.Elmit is a robot. It gets never tired to answer, and it has limited knowledge, but with all your talks Elmit gets smarter. It remembers what you were talking.",
