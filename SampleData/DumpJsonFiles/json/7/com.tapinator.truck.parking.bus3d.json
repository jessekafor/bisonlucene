        "comment": "Trailer turning is unrealistic, trailer slides sideways when turning, the steering is just crappy, its too inconsistant, also a steering direction indicator to show how sharp your wheels are turned would be very useful. Even on my big tablet screen its hard to tell. Otherwise, very cool game, it could even be used as a training simulator for trucking companies or the usdot! Also, fix the other  trailer turning issue. Last time I checked, you could jackknife a trailer more than 30 degrees, needs to lock at 85 or 90 degrees, especially on levels where you have a hard 90 into the finish. The menu interface could use some streamlining, sucks to go all the way back to the main menu when you exit gameplay, a lot of extra steps when you just want to change levels.",
