        "comment": "Started off great. Was liking it just like all the other \\\"100\\\" type games. But then it just got stupid and not making any since. People love a challenge of having to hunt items down and escape a room, but then all these with having to find combinations and stuff of zodiac signs and coordinates and animals and bananas....really? I mean what? Who cares!? 100 doors, 100 floors, and 100 missions...AWESOME GAMES...this one just flat SUCKS unless you are some ridiculously smart genius or something! Jeez!",
