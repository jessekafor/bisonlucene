Also there\\'s a bug where the ice cream machine stops working and only starts again when you serve someone ice cream. What this means is that If someone orders ice cream which you don\\'t have, you will never be e able to serve them and this is incredibly frustrating. There\\'s also another bug with inventory space not able to be fully used.",
