        "comment": "I like it, but it would be nice if one could add the aisle number that an item is on so that one could better plan their shopping trip.  It\\'d also be nice if one could scan an item as well as have a field for size.  It\\'d also be nice if there was a desktop version so that one could create a list on their home computer and then import it into their smartphone/tablet. It\\'s nice that sales tax was added so that when one buys an item that is taxed it\\'ll be added to the final total. But I think that adding the aisle number an item is on instead of just making the list alphabetical would really help.",
