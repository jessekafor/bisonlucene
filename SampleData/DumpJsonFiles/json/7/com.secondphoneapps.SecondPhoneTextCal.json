Would you like to block text messages and block calls from someone?  Would you like to be able to secure your text messages from anyone and everyone with a password protected decoy app?  Are you into health and fitness and just want a text messaging app with a cool theme? Well, hereâs your answer!Hide texts messages for 5 contacts safely with a password protected decoy âCalorie Counter App.â Once you download this app it will place an âAppleâ icon in your app drawer called (âCalorie Counterâ). The app appears to have errors to anyone else that looks at it. Text from selected contacts will be placed in this app only and will not be in your âregularâ text messages. Text messages in our app are completely separate and secure. When text messages are received, you get a notification in the status bar that says, âSubscription notice,â which goes with the Calorie Counter theme of the app having a âsubscription error.â Only you will know itâs a notification for a text message.You can switch contacts when needed.  Donât worry - once a contact is removed it will not put hidden text messages in your âregularâ text messages box.  Does not transfer existing text messages â the two areas are completely separate!  Does not support MMSâ¦The hide call log feature allows you to add the contact and all incoming, outgoing and missed calls will be deleted from your regular call logs.  You must place the outgoing call from inside the app and you have the choice of saving your call logs inside the app!!!  The Block text messaging feature will allow you to block incoming text messages. You have the option to save the blocked text messages so you can read them after you âunblockâ the contact. Or we can discard the text messages as they come in. You can still send text messages to the contact while they are blocked. We have added the âCall Blockerâ feature for that contact that is really a pain. We also give you the choice to save the call log for these blocked calls or we can discard them as they come in for you.  You can now add calls from your call logs to be blocked.The decoy app does not remove or change your âregularâ SMS icon in the app drawer. This is not a âCalorie Counterâ application! It is a decoy health and fitness themed application that allows you to hide or block text messages with password protection.Aggregated device data, including location, is measured for the purposes of market research by Placed, Inc.Placed, Inc. - Terms of Use: http://www.placed.com/terms-of-servicePlaced, Inc. - Privacy Policy: http://www.placed.com/privacy-policyFeatures:*Hide SMS messages/text messages for 5 contacts*Hide incoming/outgoing phone call logs for 5 contacts*Select from your contact list or put in new contacts*Choose your own SMS color theme*Three icon options to put on your home screen *Change Status bar notifications and descriptions*Block unwanted text messages from a contact*Block Calls from a contact*Ability to select your choice of notifications*Looks like a Calorie Counter app that requires a subscription password*Logs failed attempts to get into the app, just in case you were wondering*Displays in your âApplicationsâ list as âCalorie Counterâ",
