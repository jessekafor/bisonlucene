        "comment": "This is an excellent app, its what ive been looking for. The reason I\\'m giving 3 stars is because i can only play the video in the app. If I try to send it to fb or gmail or send it via text it gives me a \\\"video cannot be played\\\" message on my Samsung galaxy s4. Is there something I\\'m missing that you could help me with? If this problem can be solved I\\'d be happy to give 5 stars and buy the pro version. This is the only app of its kind out there! And I do love it.",

        "comment": "One of the best video capture apps I have tried. Had issues with the stock camera of my custom HTC Desire (JB 4.2.2) and this app solved the missing video capability I had. Works well with autofocus and the many effects that come with the app. Video playback works fine on MX Player and I would think that it should work fine on any other player as the files are in .mov format. And other users complain about the recording being laggy is mainly because of the high res settings chosen (more of a hardware limitation than the app at fault). I do wish the UI could be a little more refined though, and the app icon is well...is unconventional. Anyway, highly recommended and keep up the good work guys!",
