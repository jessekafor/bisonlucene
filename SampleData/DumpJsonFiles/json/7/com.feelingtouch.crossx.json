Looking out of the window, it takes you no time to learn the Doomsday had finally come. The city had fallen to zombies and became terrifying ruins. Several zombies turned their blood stained heads to this direction as they had smelled a living person. Quickly they dashed to you and there was just enough time to lift your arms: left to control the steering wheel and right to fire the gun at the zombie roaring a glass away.
