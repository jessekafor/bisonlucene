You have to give this widget access to Facebook after login (this can also be altered afterwards in your Facebook settings online). After that, I also cleared the data cache (tap & & hold on widget, go to settings & \\'clear data cache\\'). After that, this application works perfectly. Also looks nice with the transparant theme.",
