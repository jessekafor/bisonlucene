        "comment": "I use streaming services like spotify and subsonic for most of my listening, but I need to listen to music that\\'s stored on my device when I don\\'t have a clear data signal.  I\\'ve tried a lot of the highly rated players that offer paid or ad-supported versions, but most of them offer a cluttered UI with unwanted features.  This player delivers a simple and intuitive interface for browsing and playing the music files I keep on my phone.  I love the party shuffle feature, and I simply cannot live without its \\\"play all\\\" playlist shortcut that google has removed from their official app.  I\\'ll say it again.  This player delivers.",
