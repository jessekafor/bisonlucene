If you are tired of ads then there is an ad free version you have to pay for it though.JaZakAllah You are Always wellcome to Email me if Any Queries And Suggestion you Might Have.==============About this App==============Tafseer Ibn Kaseer: Tafseer means explanation of Quran. The best way to explain any Quranic Verse is to support it first with various other related Quranic Verses. Afterwards, Hadith is used for strengthening such an explanation or tafseer. To find, collect and present the related Quranic Verses and Hadith are one of the greatest jobs that was achieved by Imam Ibn Kaseer.Imam Ibn Kaseer (Hafiz Imaduddin Abulfida) was born on 701 Hijri Year in Basra city of Syria and died in 774 Hijri Year in Damascus, Syria. His name is on top of the list of those Muslim Scholars who served Quran via life-time scholarly efforts. His \"Tafseer Ibne Kaseer\" stands out amongst all other explanations or tafseers of Quran as does Sahih Bokhari from all other books of Hadith. Moulana Muhammad Junagarhi (1890-1941) from Junagarh, India translated it into Urdu language in 1930.Muhammad (pbuh) sent Muaz (raziallah) to Yemen and asked \"how will you decide?\". Muaz (Razi Allah) replied, \"From Quran\". Muhammad (pbuh) said \"If you don't find it in Quran, then?\". Muaz (Razi Allah) replied \"From the Sunnah of Allah's Prophet\". Muhammad (pbuh) said \"If it is not in my Sunnah, then?\" Muaz (Razi Allah) replied \"Now, I will do Ijtihad\". At listening this, Muhammad (pbuh) said \"Thanks to Allah, He enabled His Prophet's deputy to do which is favored by His Prophet\".You can also download the following full version of the ApplicationTested On Following Mobiles:Samsung Exhibit 4G (SGH-T759)Google Galaxy Nexus (toro)Google Nexus S (crespo)Samsung Galaxy Gio (GT-S5660)Samsung Galaxy S2Samsung Galaxy NoteHTC Sensation 4GSamsung Galaxy S (GT-I9000)Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1Asus EeePad Transformer TF101HTC Desire HDHTC Incredible SMotorola Xoom (honeycomb)Motorola Xoom (sandwich)Samsung Infuse 4G (SGH-I997)Samsung Galaxy Tab (GT-P1000)Samsung Galaxy Note (GT-N7000)HTC Desire (bravo)Dell Streak (streak)Samsung GT-I9100P (GT-I9100P)Sony Ericsson Experia Acro (IS11S)LGE Optimus One (thunderg)Huawei Turkcell T20 (hwu8650)ZTE N860 (arthur)Sony Ericsson LT18i (LT18i)Kindle Fire (amazon)HTC Thunderbolt / ADR6400LMotorola Droid (2.2)Motorola Xoom (wingray)",
