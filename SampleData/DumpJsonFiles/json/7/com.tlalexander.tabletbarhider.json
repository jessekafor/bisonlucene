    "description": "Tired of the Honeycomb System Bar getting in the way? This app allows rooted users to hide the Tablet System/Status Bar when in landscape orientation! Need access to the home or back keys? Just rotate the tablet to portrait, and the system bar is magically displayed. When you're done, just rotate the tablet back to landscape and the system bar is hidden again.THIS REQUIRES ROOT! Unfortunately there is no way to do this on non-rooted devices.Please download the free demo before buying! The demo does not allow you to exit the app with the system bar hidden, but does verify that the app will be able to hide and restore the system bar properly.Demo is here:https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tlalexander.tabletbarhiderdemoDon't use the app if you have rotation disabled! You'll get stuck without the tablet bar and you'll have to reboot to get it back.And unfortunately, this does not work with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.",

        "comment": "Although google may not be listening to it\\'s customers, people DO want a method to hide the bottom bar. I hope to see a gesture related way to hide the status bar. Perhaps just a method that keeps all the buttons working, just there\\'s no \\\"lights out\\\" mode indicators. I look forward to this app being in a functioning state. Right now, it\\'s pretty useless.",
