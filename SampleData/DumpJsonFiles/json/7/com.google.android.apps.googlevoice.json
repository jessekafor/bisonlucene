I give out my GV number and just install the app on the new phone. If you look for other apps like GrooVe IP or Talkatone, you can use GV on a phone with NO SERVICE! Can someone say FREE PHONE SERVICE! (As long as your in Wifi) I don\\'t know what the people commenting BELOW did, but I\\'ve used GV for YEARS now with MINIMAL problems FOR FREE! As far as MMS goes... that IS spotty... seems to only work if it\\'s an iPhone user sending the image and the image is sent to the e-mail attached to the GV number instead of a text. But you probably already GET your Gmail on your phone ANYWAY!",
