    "description": "NSB Surf Report Version 3 8/5/2013Instant access to NSB's most detailed, and \"local\" surf report.  Want to know what the surf is doing in NSB real fast? Try this tiny app.NSB has been my primary surf spot for over 20 years.Surf Report provided by Red Dog Surf Shop.- Upon opening the app click the Red Dog logo (center screen) to rip the report from their website.- Result is no hassle text view on your phone with their banner above the report.- Click the Red Dog banner at the top above the report to enter their website.We noticed all the \"big\" surf report apps, but nothing local, and simple taken from a local shop so you don't get fooled by generic statistical reports (when we all know conditions can change drastically and quickly).The locals who work at Red Dog update the report as per what they see for themselves so that we know what the conditions are really like for any given day.  As a result we decided to make this little app as a quick surf report reference for NSB surfers utilizing Android phones.We are not affiliated with Red Dog, nor are we receiving any compensation for this app.  It is a contribution to NSB surfers to reduce time wasted via being fooled by huge generic surf reports that cover large areas (Florida, and around the globe) that can't possibly keep up with on the ground local changing conditions throughout the day in NSB.Thanks",
