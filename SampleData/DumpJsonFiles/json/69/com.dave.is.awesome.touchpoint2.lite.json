    "description": "Touch Point 2 Lite is a fun app that lets you interactively paint on your Android device. There are many shapes, colors, and animations that you can apply to your touch points.Touch Point 2 is the new, improved and mostly rewritten version of it's little brother, Touch Point. One big difference between them is that TP2 uses the awesome LibGDX graphics package and requires OpenGL ES 2.0, and is really targeted at higher end devices and tablets. But don't let that stop you from trying TP2 - the experience here is significantly better. The original Touch Point runs well on almost any Android device, so if TP2 doesn't work for you, please check out TP1!Please consider supporting Touch Point 2 by purchasing the full version. In it, you will find more shapes and animations.Also, please note that some options may cause Touch Point 2 Lite to not work properly (e.g., Clean Screen does not work on the Optimus V, but TP2 otherwise appears to work fine). If it doesn't work on your device, please let me know so that we can document it and try to figure out what's wrong.If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please contact us at diasoftwarehq@gmail.com.Have fun!",
