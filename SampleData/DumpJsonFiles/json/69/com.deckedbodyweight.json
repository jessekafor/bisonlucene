Have you got what it takes to complete a workout the fastest and become the #1 Decked Challenge Champion?â¦â¦â¦ ACHIEVEMENTS â¦â¦â¦Complete workouts and unlock cool new achievements... Can you unlock them all?â£â£â£ NEW EXERCISES â£â£â£Awesome new exercises for all levels.****************FEATURES:- 8 pre-made workouts with different difficulty levels (more workouts to come),- Ability to create custom workouts utilizing the in-built exercise library,- Numerous exercises (with tutorials) focused on using only your body weight as resistance,- Helpful regressions and progressions for each exercise, - No equipment required,- CrossFit orientated training style,- Results and progress tracking (see your performance improve as you get fitter),- Share your achievements and challenge friends by posting your workout result to Facebook,- Personal Best (PB) tracking for pre-made workouts,- Body statistics,- Helpful exercise and well-being tips,- App to SD.**********With Decked! Challenge no two workouts are ever the same, ensuring your body/muscles are always guessing and youâre entertained. These continual variations in stimuli should also help prevent those plateaus in results that can be so frustrating. In addition, each workout is specifically structured to provide balanced results.And the great news... Absolutely NO EQUIPMENT IS REQUIRED! All you need is a little bit of floor space and some enthusiasm.So, how does it work?Decked! Challenge (Bodyweight) is a workout based around a deck of cards, randomly drawn.Each suit of the deck represents a particular exercise (e.g. Spades may be Squats) and the value of the card determines the number of repetitions (e.g. 7 of Spades would mean you need to perform 7 Squats).There are a few more rules however to keep things interesting...- Picture cards count as 10 repetitions, and- Jokers count as 10 repetitions of all 4 suit exercises (to be performed consecutively).Decked! Challenge also allows for progressive development. You can specify the difficulty of the workout by choosing the type of deck you want to use:- Beginner = No picture cards and only 1 Joker (41 cards total).- Intermediate = Full deck but only 1 Joker (53 cards total).- Advanced = Full deck and 2 Jokers (54 cards total).Donât be concerned if you canât complete the full deck of cards on your first try. These workouts are designed to be challenging, but with commitment and perseverance you will soon see your workout time decrease and the number of cards completed in a session increase!The goal in Decked! Challenge is to compete against yourself (and your friends) in an effort to beat your Personal Best for a given workout. At the end of your workout why not challenge your friends to see whoâs Decked!. Challenge friends by posting results to your Facebook page or the Decked! Challenge Facebook page and become a DECKED! CHALLENGE CHAMPION.So now the only question is...
