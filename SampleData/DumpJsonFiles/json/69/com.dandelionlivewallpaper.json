The botanical name of the dandelion is Taraxacum officinal and it is also known by other names like blow ball, pissenlit, lion's tooth and many others. Taraxacum is derived from a Greek word, which gives a meaning of altering or stirring up; this is in reference to the health properties of dandelion. The second word, officinal, used to be attached to the names of all herbs which were officially recognized. Dandelions are a perennial plant that grows best in full sun with moist soil. Once the plant is established, though, it can handle shade and water deprivation. The plant bears bright yellow, round flowers, and leaves that have a tooth-like shape.The flower is surrounded by a series of yellow petals called bracts. There is an inner and outer layer of bracts. The inner bracts remain erect until the seeds mature at which point they turn downward, thereby permitting the seeds to disperse. The outer bracts always remain pointing in a downward direction.The dandelion plant does not require pollination in order to reproduce; rather it self-pollinates and reproduces. It is the process of reproducing which creates its characteristic fluffy white sphere.Following self-pollination and flowering, the dandelion develops a round cluster of seed cases. Each achene produces a seed. When mature, the inner layer of bracts points downward and the flower dries out for several days, eventually falling off, revealing a ball.The ball that remains once the flower falls off ultimately opens into a full sphere of as many as 200 thin fluffy white threads attached to a stem. This change can happen overnight.After dandelion seeds are carried away from the plants by the wind, they can fly for miles. After landing, the seeds can sprout right on the soil's surface at any time of year, which allows new plants to grow easily. If the plant is cut off, it can also regrow. Dandelions are hardy plants, and easily adapt to difficult growing conditions, such as dry soil or competition with plants such as grass.Get Dandelion Live Wallpaper and enjoy these cute âyellow plantsâ on your phone!  \"Galaxy S4 Sunshine\" will brighten up your screen!This live wallpaper has been tested on latest devices such as Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, Nexus 7, HTC Desire S and Sony Xperia S.
