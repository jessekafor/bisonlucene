This application allows you to control advanced features of overclocking kernels, you can change the voltage applied and select frequencies you want to use.Voltage Control Extreme (developer name sulph8), features include:Â - Support more than one profile- CPU history display- overvolting support (+50mV and 1500mV limit)Â - undervolting up to -250mV (lite version limited to -200mV)Devices supported (with proper kernels!):Galaxy S3 (GT-i9300)Galaxy S2 (GT-i9100)Infuse 4G (SGH-i997)Galaxy S (GT-i9000(m))Captivate (SGH-897)Vibrant\t(SGH-T959)Fascinate (SCH-I500)Epic 4G (SGH-D700)Galaxy Tab (P1000)Nexus S,and many, many more!Supported features may vary on depending on model and kernel.Voltage Control\tworks with Eclair, Froyo and Gingerbread, Honeycomb, ICS, JB ROMs, no matter if STOCK or CM7/CM9/AOKP/MIUI.This is a lite version.It supports:- CPU overclock / underclock- set CPU governor- changing of I/O Scheduler- selection of maximum OC frequency- selection if minimum frequency- enabling/disabling of particular frequencies (on supported kernels!) - changing voltage per frequency- You can create up to two switchable profiles- Widget with profile switcher and app launcher (passive)- it can create CWM flashable boot settings remover, to save the day.After you install the key Extreme features will be unlocked.Consider it rather *donate version* because these features are NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK.USE THIS APPLICATION ON YOUR OWN RISKI recommend app nitrality, which I develop with insanity ROM maker nitr8!Similar CPU speed setting apps: SetCPU, OverclockWidget, PimpMyCPU, CPU Tuner, Milestone Overclock, CPU Master, No-frills CPU Control",
