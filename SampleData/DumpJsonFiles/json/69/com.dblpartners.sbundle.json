This one has a nice interface; I really like the Key Takeaway feature. The answer explanations are well done. But the content is severely outdated. Some of this content was dropped two exams ago (after the 600 series), and much of the content just hasn\\'t kept up with technology (several years outdated). With content updates, could be a winner!",
