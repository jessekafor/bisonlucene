    "description": "Depth of Field Table is a tool for photographers wishing to quickly look up Depth of Field (DOF) values. This App differs from other DOF calculators in that it generates a table of values instead of doing single calculations for a particular focal length, distance, and aperture. You simply set the (actual) focal length and calculate. (You can also pinch to change focal length.)Any feedback/bug reports/suggestions is appreciated!Possible features in future versions:*Performance improvements*Customizable Circle of Confusions and focus distances*Table based on Focus Distance vs. Focal Length (user sets aperture)*Ad free Donation version",
