        "comment": "This can be a reasonably helpful time-killer, since it gets you thinking about LEED concepts. However, it desperately needs a careful, well-informed editor to go through and revise it if it\\'s going to be of any real value. A lot of the questions are very poorly worded, resulting in unproductive head-scratching and guessing.  What\\'s worse, a number of the questions have incorrect answers listed as the correct responses, which seems to act against whatever potential benefit one might gain from using the app. It\\'s on the right track, but this app needs a new/improved version.",
