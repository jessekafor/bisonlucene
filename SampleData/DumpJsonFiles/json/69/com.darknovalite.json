        "comment": "I\\'m a fan of the Escape Velocity series (Mac/PC space trading/fighting/exploring games) and out of all the other apps in the market right now, this game is the most similar.  I like it a lot and plan to buy the full version when it\\'s time to upgrade my ship.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S and occasionally if I click on an event in a planet my screen will dim and nothing will happen.  Turning my phone\\'s display on/off helps so that is a minor bug but doesn\\'t ruin the game at all.  Great job!",

        "comment": "As previously mentioned the game is too limited on the light version and im not going to pay \\302\\2432.54 just so i can have the ability to buy a ship with a laser, as thats all your paying for the ability to fight back and the removal of the nag screen telling you to buy premium!  When playing the lite version there are a few things that will happen. 1. You start to travel get shot go KABOOM! 2. You flee and get to flee another day 3. You buy the second ship, escape pod, shield and cloaking device and keep trading but that gets boring after 5minutes.  Full version is worth probably \\302\\2431 for what the game is at the moment and lite version needs to let you test out the game more as for now though im removing the game its boring.",
