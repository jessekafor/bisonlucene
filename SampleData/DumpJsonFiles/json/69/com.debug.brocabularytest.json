    "description": "You're at a party, or some other brodeo, when a young gentleman approaches you. He seems cool enough: popped collar polo, aviator glasses hanging around his neck, cap with a frayed brim. Noting your Aquaman shirt, he says, \"What up Broseidon?\" You freak out, not knowing how to broceed. What's the brotocol? How do you address such a bro and carry on this conversation? That's where Brocabulary comes in. It is a consortium of all bro vernacular that will ease your social interactions with your brosephs. Featuring nearly 200 words, many of which are from users like you!",
