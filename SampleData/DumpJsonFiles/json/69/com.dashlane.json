If this had been stated up front, I would not have spent several hours building up a database.  The product is easy to use, but, in my opinion, has one glaring deficiency, it display large graphic representation of all sites for which there has been a password assigned.  Not a great design feature. I prefer to have the ability to access the password visible only when triggered by the user from a drop down menu.",
