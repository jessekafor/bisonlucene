You can paint new paintings or load photos from your gallery into Paper Camera type effects, then with a brush or pencil, \\'wipe\\' away parts of an another layer, some of which have a 3D-like edging. You can produce some really interesting effects.   You can do this with Adobe\\'s Sketch Mobile, or other layered paint app, but nothing  pre-loaded, layers or frames. I use a lot of Android paint/photo apps, and Paper Artist is a keeper. Needs zoom, however.",
