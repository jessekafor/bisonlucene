In reply to a previous comment, the score to unlock level 3 is lower than to unlock 2 because level 2 is significantly harder to score on than 1! With practise I got better, but a practise area of the game to get used to the physics would be good :)",

Eventually I beat football by luck, but with Golf it seems every other ball bounces out of the goal, and I need 30,000 to unlock the next level...  Also annoying is highscores seem to change themselves whenever yhey want. I could get 15, 000 on a level, then in a round or two I could be back down to 6000 or something as a high score.",
