        "comment": "I was initially quite excited by this app --- it promotes itself as having some good features, and the photos on the apps Play page make it look really clever, compared to other apps BUT those photos will NEVER be obtained using the current version Android app, they come from apps for other platforms (in this case, at least, the desktop addon)!!! And some of the best features are dependent on purchasing expensive addons. It certainly has \\\"potential\\\" but I think its full advertised price, and its adds, need to include reference to those more expensive addons. The current promotion can\\'t truly be considered as other than a scam. These \\\"deficiencies\\\" explain the current low rating of the app, but not the obscenely high ratings for its competitor -- we simply don\\'t have an \\\"adequate\\\" Android database app. And after sales support? Fuggedaboutit!  My non-receipt of \\\"service\\\", related to inability to access Play Market sales records, shows they shouldn\\'t be selling through here.",

        "comment": "I have been using HanDBase since the heyday of the Palm, through S60, IOS and now Android. The app has proved reliable and adaptable and I cannot imagine not having it available. I also use the desktop add-on  Setting up databases and altering their fields and parameters is straight-forward and intuitive and the user is able to import and export data to/from external files.  Other versions of the database did have a \\'forms\\' ability, which I used on my Palm. Amazingly easy to spend hours tweaking something that works fine :-) When the IOS app first came out, this facility was not available but I got used to not having it quite quickly. The easy screen scrolling of the iPhone to some extent mitigated against this absence, and the same applies to Android. I guess if forms became available I would use them, but the app is perfectly usable without.  Support is very prompt and helpful. On the odd occasion when I have asked for advice, this has taken a day to appear, but given the difference in our time-zones, I regard this as excellent service.  All in all, an excellent database application.",

        "comment": "Capable database with a lot of good features. The \\\"form\\\" is more like a filtered table view - which is very useful as it allows you to sort by date, putting recent entries on the screen.  What I was hoping for was \\\"forms\\\" in the sense that Ms Access has them, as a customisable data entry screen. Every field will take up a whole line - for a small screen this is not a good use of the space. Date and time and some other data could easily fit on one line and you typically don\\'t need the labels.  Overall: good",

        "comment": "Just bought this recently, it functions well for now, but I\\'m waiting for features (from other platform) to hit android as well, especially forms and photos.
