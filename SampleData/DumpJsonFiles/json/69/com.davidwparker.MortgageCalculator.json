    "description": "This app is Ad-Free.The Mortgage Calculator enables you to see how much your monthly payment will be for a mortgage, given the number of years, amount of principal, and an interest rate.It also enables you to see the break down of each monthly payment so you can see how much is paid toward principal and how much is paid toward interest. Additionally, you can click on a month row in order to see how much principal remains until the mortgage is paid off.The mortgage calculator can also be used as a regular loan calculator.The app is US Dollar-based ($). Note: if you want other monetary systems, then I don't recommend this app. Please don't leave 1-star ratings for trivial things like this, but for things like crashing.Please note that I have no way to contact people via comments on here, so the best way for me to fix your problems is for you to email me at the email address listed below. Thanks.If you have any issues, please let me know: davidwparker@gmail.com",
