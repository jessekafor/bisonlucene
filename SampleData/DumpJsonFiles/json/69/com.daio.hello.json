All of the animal sounds are very accurate, except for the weird random singing mouse. Doesn\\'t lock, but I got a kids app folder that does lock so when he exits, he can only go into baby apps I put in it. Problem solved, thus 5 stars.",

The best part is that the animals keep changing on their own so I dont have to keep pressing anything. Stops him for crying in an instant & gives me time to get things done!! We need more apps like this!",

Months later she gets just as excited about it. It keeps her entertained every time! She does get out of the game so a lock would be ideal! (that would get it 5 stars!)",
