Bank Balance simplifies the message sending process so you just tap a button to get your account balance(s). Your bank confirms your account by your synced phone number and then sends you your requested information.Disclosure: This app requires that you set up Text Banking with your bank(s). Once set up, Bank Balance will send you your account balance(s) with a single tap. Enjoy.Message and data rates may apply. Such charges include those from your communications service provider. Delivery of alerts may be delayed for various reasons, including service outages affecting your phone, wireless or internet provider; technology failures; and system capacity limitations.
