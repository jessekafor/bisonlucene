    "description": "Remember back in high school when you played Age of Empires II all the time? Now remember those hilarious taunts (\"Yes\", \"Start the game already!\", \"Quit Touchin' Me!\")? Now you can bring that functionality to your android phone!Running this application will start an engine that waits for your friends to send you taunts in the form of text messages! To use, send the number of the taunt (e.g. 1, 14, 22) and listen as their phone delivers your taunt.",
