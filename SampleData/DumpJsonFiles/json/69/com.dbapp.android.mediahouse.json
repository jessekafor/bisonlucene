MediaHouse powers your device i.e. phone, tablets or google TVs with the following capabilities:1. Automatic scan of your home network over Ethernet or Wifi to identify PC, NAS or any other device running UPnP/DLNA media server.2. Shows capabilities of the scanned servers by dividing them into two categories, one from which you can serve content i.e. called Play From and others to which you can play that content i.e. called Play To.3. Use MediaHouse as a browser, player or controller. 4. MediaHouse can control playback of content from a Media Server (called - Play From) to a Media renderer (called - Play To).5. Favorites - Save albums and folders from multiple media servers while browsing6. Play lists - add, delete, rename music play lists. Last played audio tracks are automatically saved.7. Search your big server libraries for albums, artists, video, images by their title 8. Remembers your server selection and uses it in subsequent runs.9. Built in music player with options to seek, pause, play, loop, shuffle and repeat.10. Build in photo viewer with slideshow option.11.

        "comment": "Very stylish, but spoiled by a few rough edges.  Queue rarely plays smoothly on remote device - stops despite two options (acquire wake lock/handle stop event) being set.
