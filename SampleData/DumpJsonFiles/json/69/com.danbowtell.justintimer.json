    "description": "Simple countdown timer app.Have multiple timers running at the same time. Add new timers quickly.Swipe to reset.Custom notification sounds.This is great to use as a kitchen timer or to remind you the ironing has been done. Proving bread? Letting the kids play on the computer for a specified time? Want a 3 minute nap? Setting it up barely requires you to be awake.This app is open source.",

        "comment": "I love the simplicity of the app and it seems to work fine until I want to do other things with my phone. When I come back to the timer, it has added time back to my timers which makes it useless. Do I have to have the timers on screen all the time for the app to work properly?  EDIT: I\\'ll add more information to clarify our purpose. We have 3 kids and want to keep track of how much time they spend on the computer each day. We set three 3 hour timers and start and pause them throughout the day as needed when they want on the computer. The problem is that letting the timer run for just 30 minutes and coming back to the timer app later to stop it shows the timer still running, but with much less than 30 minutes used on the timer. Additionally, if I check the time left on the timer and go back to the app 10-15 minutes later, the time left has jumped up (adding time back to the timer) for no reason even though it is supposed to still be counting down.  This has happened on my phone (Infuse with 2.3) and my wife\\'s phone (Galaxy S2 with 2.3).   I don\\'t know if this app is just better with shorter timers, but it is useless for us. I would really like to use it, but cannot.",
