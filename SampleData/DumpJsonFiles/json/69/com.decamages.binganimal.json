It not only enhances their memory skills, but helps them learn about sportsmanship and that they don\\'t get to win all the time. This app works really well in the car and helps ease long drives. In addition, it is quite fun to compete against adult friends using this game.",

Not only very well designed in a way that the graphics and the sounds captivate her attention immediately, but the game is very educational. Definitely a must download on your Android.

What I liked the most was how they actually wanted to play together (as opposed to fighting for the phone!) when they discovered the two-player mode. I totally recommend BingAnimal as an educational, social development and fun app for little kids!",
