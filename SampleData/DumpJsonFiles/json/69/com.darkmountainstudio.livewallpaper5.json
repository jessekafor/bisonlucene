    "description": "A beautiful live wallpaper showing colorful meadow in the summer. Observe fireflies and bubbles over the swaying grass. Watch how times of the day change dynamically from dawn to night and how droplings fall and slide on the grass blades. You can also touch the fireflies to make them run away or pop a bubble of your desire. This wallpaper uses OpenGL for rendering with full support for landscape and home screen switching. It supports all resolutions.You can configure a lot of settings for the duration of a time of the day, fireflies' reaction to touch, popping bubbles and their number and much more.Note: for the first run you have to be connected to internet for license validation.Permissions: Coarse location is needed for sunrise/sunset times calculation.",

        "comment": "Great quality. I really like this fireflies, I wish there were more or the option to choose the number of fireflies. Firefly colour choice for silver vs golden would be nice too. The bubbles are a bit weird but it feels like it\\'s missing something if there aren\\'t a few bubbles. Maybe more fireflies would make up for that.",
