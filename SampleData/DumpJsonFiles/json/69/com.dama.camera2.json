    "description": "Camera 2 is the ultimate real-time effects app.Take better pictures, amazing videos and have fun creating them.Featuring many unique high quality effects, grouped into families sharing a common theme:â Old Time: make your camera look like something from the 20's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's or 80'sâ Lomos and Retro: everyone's favourite, from normal to sublime.â Comic: to express yourself, half tone, B&W, printed comics, new style, mix and matchâ Art: sometimes you just want to create a piece of art with a tapâ Sci-Fi: see it to believe itâ Computer: and finally, for every geek or nerd out there, this is unmissable. Old computer monitorsMany of the effects can be boosted by applying a superb \"out of focus\"/\"depth of field\" filter, and, as usual, it's all real time.Main features:â Capture high resolution photos with effectsâ Capture video with effects (*)â Apply the effects to your existing photos tooâ Share your creations straight from the appâ More than 25 high quality effectsâ Tweak each effect to achieve your own unique lookâ Animated effects(*) Video recording requires that your device supports NEON instructions, most modern devices do.CUSTOM ROMSâ Camera 2 doesn't officially support custom ROMs. The app might work, but there are know issues especially with CyanogenMod. Please update to an official ROM or ask us for a refund if you purchased the app.FAQâ Why does the video recorder launch the default camera recording app?- This happens only when taking unfiltered videos because it is faster, for videos with effects the camera 2 recorder is used.â How can I see the pictures I've taken with Camera 2?- For now you can only see the last picture/video you've created within the app, we plan to add a fully featured gallery but for the time being you will have to use the standard gallery app to see all pictures.â Zoom doesn't work on the preview of my device why?- Try the Software Zoom option in the settings, this might fix the problem.POLICIESIf you are unhappy with the app please contact us to our support email we'll try to either fix the problem or give you a full refund.Feel free to contact us if you want to share your feedback or experience.Finally, Camera 2 does not store/collect/send/manage any personal data, all photos and videos taken with Camera 2 are solely yours and yours only. PERMISSIONSInternet: only required to share your pictures. If you don't share, internet won't be used.Microphone: only to record audio with your videos, no other use.Location: only used to store location to your photos, it's disabled by default and it's optional.LEGALThis software uses code of FFmpeg licensed under the  LGPLv2.1 and its source can be downloaded here: jfdplabs.com/ffmpeg",

However, if you find the Import/Open File icon, you can launch File Commander, etc., and delete files.
