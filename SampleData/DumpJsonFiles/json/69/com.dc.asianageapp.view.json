        "comment": "All columns and rows are well sorted, it do what it states. But onething which i felt that its selection popup is flawed doesnt appear correctly on my galaxy note also news which it shows is not latest but of last day like a newsppr, would like developers to rectify it. App is good, dont expect much graphics but good news. Notifications could have been better.",
