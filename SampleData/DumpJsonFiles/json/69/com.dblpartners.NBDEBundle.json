        "title": "Great application",
        "comment": "Actually I can speak only for the first part, but I don\\'t see any reason why the second part wouldn\\'t be as good as first one. Its a very helpful application. For sure it can\\'t replace your own study books or the First Aid but its a great supplement of questions, especially since three exam results depend largely on the quantity of questions you review. Second thing is that the team behind the application its not just very professional but very helpful and supportive, really thank you guys.",
