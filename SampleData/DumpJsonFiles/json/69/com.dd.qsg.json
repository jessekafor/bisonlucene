    "description": "I bet you've wanted to quit for a while, huh? Well, this game takes a different approach at quitting. I don't throw pop-ups in your face, or tell you reasons why you should quit. You'll smoke when you want, and you already know that it isn't exactly healthy.I designed this simple game so that you could simply keep track of how long it's been since you had your last smoke. Then, you can try and break your own records, earn achievements, and even quit! OK, lets not jinx it.The game is very easy to play. Just click the button when you have a smoke, and thats it! It will keep track of when your last smoke was, how long since you've had a smoke, and show you your best records and achievements. Nothing super flashy about it - just straight to the point.",
