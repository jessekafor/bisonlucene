Also,  if you pause you may or may not get to go back AND it will loop on you so you only get about 1 segment in the paused portion. To get out of loop you have to go live and thus miss content. Awesome idea. Please work on Android version.",

I don\\'t like the clunky/ugly design and lack of a landscape view, both of which are  big negatives for me. Also there\\'s no rewind button on my HTC Evo. I\\'ll be sticking with TuneIn Pro for now because of its rewind and recording features - I\\'ll use this app to listen to old clips and maybe use it full time if they update it later down the road.",
