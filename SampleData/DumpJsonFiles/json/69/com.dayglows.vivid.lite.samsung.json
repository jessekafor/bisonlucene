I tried zappotv app and it found the tv while on the wifi dongle. If you get this issue sorted I will more than happy to buy the pro version. Also it would be nice to allow the user to input tge tv IP manually if it is not detected automatically. Regards",

        "comment": "This app works for me. I am using a Samsung Smart TV Model UN60D7000. The smart phone I am using to send media to the TV is a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Communication between my phone and the TV is with  a wireless network (wifi) using a D-Link Access Point Model DAP-1525.  I have been able to play video, music, or pictures stored on my phone onto my TV.  It won\\'t show every stored picture.  The ones I noticed it would not show were those I had cropped out with the S-Pen and saved.  The images created with the built-in camera did show fine though. As for video it did show those captured with the built-in camera and a .wmv file I copied to my phone from a Pc.  This is awesome to show guests or just to enjoy the enhanced sound and display.  Sounds great with the optical cable coming out of my TV and into my stereo receiver with Bose speakers.   If this tool could just support showing the pictures I saved using the S-Pen I will then give it 5 stars. Otherwise it is still very good for me.",
