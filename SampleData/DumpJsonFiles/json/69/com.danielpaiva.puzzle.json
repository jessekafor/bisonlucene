    "description": "Hyper Dimensional Image PuzzleThis is not an ordinary puzzle. This is a Hyper Dimensional image puzzle. With only 9 pieces you can have as many pictures you want and change not only position, but its faces. It is like having a one thousand pieces puzzle in only 9. Right now, the game comes with 4 images. Very soon, you will be able to add your own pictures and choose from one to as many you want in the same game. Lots of fun. Also, I am working on an online rating on face book where one will show number of images x number of clicks x time. All FREE. Always.",
