I was hoping the app would eventually work since I heard good things about it. However, the app continued to state that I \\\"do not have an internet connection\\\" and would not let me past the main screen to set up an account.  I guess I should\\'ve read the reviews before downloading it.  I\\'m now uninstalling for good, as l\\'ve given up and have found an app that actually works!",
