    "description": "Quickly is a simple app that creates an ongoing notification in your notification drawer filled with up to 12 shortcuts to an application launcher, direct dial to a contact, direct messaging to a contact, direct call to a contact, a shortcut to a URL, or applications that you can configure.Once the notification is created, expand the notification to see the shortcuts.The nice thing about Quickly is that it never runs in the background, and the only system resource it uses is about 800kb for it's notification. It's lightweight and efficient and will remain that way.NOTE:-----------------------------If you're using a Android 4.1 you will have to use a pinch-to-expand gesture to show the shortcuts when the notification is collapsed. \"This addon uses pinch motions, not swipe motions. pinch from center to edge of notification area to get the shortcuts to display, and from edge to center to collapse it.\"Thank you Tim Strobel!------------------------------One of Android Police's 55 best new apps for February.One of Android Authority's 7 new sizzling apps of the week for February 22.One of Android Headlines Top 10 best android apps for March 2013.One of Appstorm's 30 modern android launchers------------------------------http://www.androidauthority.com/7-sizzling-new-apps-week-february-22-160056/http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/02/18/new-app-quickly-uses-jelly-beans-expandable-notifications-to-put-an-app-launcher-in-your-shade/http://androidheadlines.com/2013/03/featured-top-10-best-android-apps-march-2013.htmlhttp://android.appstorm.net/roundups/customization-roundups/30-modern-android-launchers-homescreen-replacements/------------------------------Stay tuned for updates.Current bugs:------------------------------No translations----------------------------Please contact developer for bugs and suggestions!Thanks!",

And also include a reset slots button for all or a specific slot  I would like what you said as your response to one of the comments, to have the first four apps shown without pinch to expand, that would be great, highly recommend, works on android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean! Also, i do like high priority mode :P, but because I am using a tablet, it makes it more awkward, so  please put first 4 apps show maybe",
