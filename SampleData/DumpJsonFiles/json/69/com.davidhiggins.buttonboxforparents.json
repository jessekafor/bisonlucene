    "description": "Button Box for Parents has been designed to bring technology to the often repetitive instructions required by some children to perform basic tasks around the house.  It is intended for fun and hopefully will get the childs attention with realisation that you, as the parent are continually having to say the same things over and over again.  Trust you enjoy this little application and use it wisely to get the message across !",
