        "comment": "It\\'s a good overall study aid, but it doesn\\'t differentiate between the levels of certification. Example, cPT doesn\\'t need to know ekg info but there\\'s still questions on content area. Bottom line: STUDY YOUR BOOKS! This won\\'t help you pass because questions are completely different.",
