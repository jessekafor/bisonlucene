    "description": "Velodroid is the simplest and most accurate GPS Bike Computer App on the market. Designed with the specific needs of cyclists in mind, Velodroid presents your ride information on clear and uncluttered screens. It can even provide in-ride statistics using a speech capability!The Elevation Profiles shown for the Tour de France are pretty neat, right? Well now you can access the same data as the professional cyclists. Velodroid makes it possible, providing Elevation Profiles using the most accurate altitude data available. Velodroid is generally correct to within 1m, while a normal phone GPS can only promise accuracy to the nearest 30m. However, if you are concerned about conserving battery, Velodroid has a nifty power saving mode which will use the GPS data during the ride, and allow you to update to the more accurate data when you return.Velodroid maps your ride over familiar Google Maps satellite imagery (hybrid satellite/map images) in real-time, allowing you to quickly determine your location and check your progress. The intuitive panning and zooming tools allow you to navigate during your ride and keep yourself on track.Whether you are training for an event, or just cycling to keep fit, Velodroid has some great tools to lend a hand. The intervals timer allows you to set up a training regime, and Velodroid is the only app that lets you see your improving fitness over time with its innovative fitness chart.Velodroid takes care of all the basic bicycle computer functions in style, providing you a large easy-to-read speedometer, and a broad set of route and personal best statistics in your choice of Metric or Imperial units. Velodroid can even keep the screen awake if you choose to use it as bike computer. All of the important route statistics are covered, including: - Current Speed - Trip Time - Route Distance  - Average Speed - Maximum Speed - Current Elevation - Maximum Elevation - Elevation Gain - Current Gradient - Maximum GradientSharing is well catered for, Velodroid can share your ride to any app that supports sharing, even letting you use an app like TweetDeck to handle both Facebook and Twitter posts at once. With Velodroid, your ride data is yours, it allows you to export and email your rides in a variety of formats including GPX, KML (for Google Earth), TCX and CSV. It also has integrated functionality for directly uploading your ride to a RideWithGPS.com account where you can access a treasure trove of post-ride analysis tools.Take Velodroid for a ride today!We're keen to hear your feedback, issues or requests at support@velodroid.com / http://twitter.com/#!/velodroid / http://www.velodroid.com",

        "comment": "There are plenty of plus points to list about this great app: It has a lovely, lightweight and clear aesthetic to its design, and this translates across into its ease of use and efficient function.   There are a number of well considered options, of which the most useful is the fairly recently added \\'Power Saving mode\\'. This allowed my battery to last around three times longer than it did without it enabled. Having power saving enabled simply deactivates accurate elevation and gradient recording; speed, distance and such have remained precise. And the great thing is, one can select to \\'fix\\' the elevation data for a ride after its completion. However, I have experienced a few issues with this: occasionally the elevation data does not download, and once, my ride data was lost completely.  A second fantastic feature available in the settings is the \\'Voice Announcements\\'. Very handy if your phone spends nearly all of the ride in your pocket, this reads out your key ride stats in a clear, synthetic voice at a choice of pre-set intervals. Thirdly, the RideWithGPS integration is superb and seamless.   If you crack out a lot of miles on your bike, this is the app for tracking them.",

I hope support is investigating the reason - at least they contacted quickly.",
