    "description": "Danfoss Industrial Refrigeration strives to make your work with industrial refrigeration as easy as possible. Our latest tool is Danfoss IR app. It is a âOne Platform appâ for you, who work with Industrial Refrigeration. In the Danfoss IR app we will collect apps/tools that we hope will make your work with industrial refrigeration products from Danfoss easier. 1st function: The first app within the Danfoss IR app is SVL Flexlineâ¢. SVL Flexlineâ¢ is our newly introduced line components for industrial refrigeration. The app takes you through the product features and benefits. It gives you easy access to technical data and other relevant information. But that is not all. It also includes a bit of fun in the form of a game. The game is built around the âOne Platform, Multiple Optionsâ, which are the principles for the new SVL Flexlineâ¢ line components. Test your product knowledge and have a fun competition with your colleagues, on who can answer the questions the quickest. 2nd function: The next tool that will come within the Danfoss IR app is a Spare Parts app. This app will make it easy to find relevant spare parts for a given Danfoss industrial refrigeration valve. More information will follow when this app it is ready. 3rd function: Letâs see what the future brings... All you have to do is download the Danfoss IR app, and you will always be updated on the apps developed for Danfoss Industrial Refrigeration. How To Use As we hope the app will be âa toolbox inside your phoneâ, you will, when you open the Danfoss IR app find the different apps/tools âhanging on a tool-wallâ.
