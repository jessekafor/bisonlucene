        "comment": "Wow, this app has made my life so much easier. Not complex, easy to use. No learning curve so was able to use right away. Even emailed my lists to my niece, which had items crossed off that were done and emailed her the list from the app, The app had separated the done and not done items from the list into separate areas so she would know the progress.   Thanks for making it simple and productive!  Suggested feature would be to be able to re-organize a list on the screen so the completed projects would relocate to the bottom of the list leaving those still needing to be completed at the top..This makes it easier on a large list to read the tasks yet to be done without scrolling through all the items on the list.  I understand that you can delete completed items, but when people keep adding projects to your work list while you are working on getting things done, and you are  also emailing them status updates (the vocalist) on what has been done and not done, you really like them to see how much work you are accomplishing.and how much more they are tasking you.",

It\\'s really nice just to be able to talk the items in several at a time rather than speaking and waiting and speaking then waiting.  Other apps might have more sophistication and sorting and that sort of thing but most of us for grocery list and to do lists just want to enter it in quickly without having to type it in.",
