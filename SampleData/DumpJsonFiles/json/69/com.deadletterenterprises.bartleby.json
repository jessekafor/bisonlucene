    "description": "Based on the Melville short story âBartleby the Scrivenerâ, this magical 8 ball will help you deflect your responsibilities by befuddling your supervisors with vague, passive refusals. Among the deft quips are Bartleby's stand-by \"I'd prefer not to\" as well as more modern statements like \"That's not on my radar.\"",
