    "description": "My Little Pony Wallpapers and Theme ApplicationMy Little Pony is an entertainment franchise developed by Hasbro which is marketed primarily to girls. It started as a line of plastic pony toys developed by Bonnie Zacherle, Charles Muenchinger and Steve D'Aguanno which have been produced since 1983. The ponies feature colorful bodies, manes and a unique symbol on one or both sides of their flanks. These are referred to in the two most recent generations as \"cutie marks.\" My Little Pony was revamped at least four times with new and more modern looks to appeal to a new market.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
