    "description": "NOW WITH A RETRO LOOK - AN ANIMATED OLD CASSETTE TAPE. YOU CAN CHOSE BETWEEN 5 DIFFERENT CASSETTE TAPES.Simple Media Player can play mp3, ogg and wav files, read ID3 tags and it has all the necessary functions (repeat, shuffle, search, save/load playlists) for a media player, but nothing more, just to keep it simple and user-friendly. It's more like one of those portable mp3 players - simple, straightforward and easy to use.Unlike other media players, with Simple Media Player you can manage your playlist very easy - you just need to navigate to the directory where you keep your mp3, wav and ogg files and select as many mp3 files (or wav or ogg) as you want to add to your playlist. Or you can add all media files found in that directory if you want. And of course, you can save your playlist, create a new one or edit an existing one. Everything in the simplest possible way.You can chose between 2 views - one which will display the playlist and another one which shows an old cassette tape running while the music is playing. This view also has controls on screen.For more info, please visit http://apps4droid.blogspot.com/2011/09/hitamp.html. Also please rate it if you like it. And if you get any errors, or if the application force close, please let me know and I will do my best to fix it.MP3 file icon, OGG file icon, WAV file icon and directory icon designed by Rhor - http://rhor.deviantart.com/.

I\\'m waiting for 3 more features for the app to be perfect: add directory, remove songs from playlist and manual shuffle of songs. Great job so far.",
