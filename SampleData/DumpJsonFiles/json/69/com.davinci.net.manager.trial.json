Therefore i have decided to make one for myself, and glad to share it with you.Net Manager has following features:- Fully control on wifi and mobile data based on Screen On / Screen Off / Screen Unlock / Airplane mode / On Call and Schedule.- Automatically disable connection on screen-off after specified seconds or until all connection activities finished.- Automatically enable connection on screen unlock or screen on after specified seconds.- Automatically disable mobile data when WiFi is connected.- Configurable periodic reconnection to allow notifications.- Run in foreground: always show app icon in the notification bar (optional).- Airplane mode: automatically enable/disable reconnections at specified times.- Easy and clean interface.- Lightweight and fast app.------ Attention! ------This is 4 days trial version.
