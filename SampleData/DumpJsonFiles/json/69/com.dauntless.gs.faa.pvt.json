It is great for studying and the app lets me study just about anywhere when I have a free minute. I used other study guides before but this company really polishes their product!

This was suggested to me by a friend who scored a 93% using this app.  I can pick a topic, study for however long I like and save my progress.   It also saves your progress if you are interrupted in the middle of a question. I have the S4 and it runs perfect.  Thanks Dauntless!",
