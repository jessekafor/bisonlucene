        "comment": "There are far too many errors in both treatment and diagnosis of diseases. Ex.endocrine q #13 pt has Graves Disease and the tx is Levothyroxine? The explanation says Levothyroxine is an antithyroid antibody? Where was that researched, cuz its COMPLETELY WRONG! How can you people make blatent mistakes like that. Synthroid is only going to exacerbate this patients sx\\'s and might lead to Thyroid Storm thus causing further morbidity and mortality to the pt. tx of Graves is radioactive Iodine",
