    "description": "** This is not an official app by ArenaNetThis app uses the GW2 API to collect data in regards to the World Boss Events for eg: Shadow Behemoth.Simple native android app User Interface to facilitate an easy way of monitoring the events. The events will auto refresh every 1 minute.Please email me if you encounter any issues, any feedback or any suggestions. You can also pm me in game at \"Sc Ar Z\" without the quotes.Available Features- Monitor World Bosses, Temple events- Selection of Server- Auto Refresh- During event either Pre or Up state, the refresh rate will be auto adjusted to 15 seconds- Selection of Refresh timing- Simple, Clean, easy to use User Interface and BRIGHT LARGE text to show when event is up- Keep Screen Turn On (No Screensaver) when monitoring the Timer page, can be turned off- Event Timer, Time Limit timer (FE, Golem, etc), Up Timer (Option to turn On/Off)- Events jump to the top when Pre/Up- Checking of Open Dungeons (COF/COE) and Temples (COE and Temple of Lyssa currently not available)- More Information for events. Touch the status to show more info, disable by unchecking the option \"Turn On More Information\"- Alert when a event is Pre or Up. On initial launch, if there is more than 1 event Pre/Up, the alert will only show \"Multiple Event\". Please feedback to me if you would like to see a Notification versionIMPORTANT NOTICECurrently the API does not cater for DateTime stamp. As this app runs purely on the APIs, it becomes a local tracking in regards to the timer. Thus do not over rely on the timer. On initial launch, the timer will be likely not accurate. After a event has been encountered, the timer will be updated accordingly. If the app is not used for a period of time, the timer will be calculated base on the number of cycles base on (Time To Window duration + Window duration) as there is no data as to when the last event was encountered.This timer feature will be the number 1 priority as soon as the APIs get updated.Features to be implemented- Auto reset of checkboxes when 100% rare reward is reset- More events (Looking for User Contributions)- More wacky event messages (Looking for User Contributions)",
