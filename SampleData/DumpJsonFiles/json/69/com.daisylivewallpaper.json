Since the old days, this plant has always been considered as a supreme flower and they belong to the group that has played significant roles in human history. Its name came from Anglo Saxon words âdaes eageâ meaning âdayâs eyeâ. This is due to the fact that the flowers open at dawn, just at the time, when the day is about to begin. They originated in Central, Northern and Western Europe, however now they are grown throughout the world. The flowers are used by children to make chains or garlands. Daisy leaves are edible, hence are often used in salads. The flower itself can be used to make herbal tea and honey. Florists love to use lots of white and yellow plants when making bridal bouquets. The plants have earned their popularity indoors and outdoors by their attractive blooms and their ease of growth.Daisy represents purity, loyal love and are symbol of innocence. It also can symbolize new beginnings. It is also said to be the ultimate symbol of inner sanctity. The plant was revered by the Church as the symbol of Virgin Mary. It was also believed by some people that after the death of a person, a daisy begins to grow on its own if the deceased had been a good man. It is a fertility symbol in both the Christian and pagan traditions.In some regions, these plants are also known as âthunderflowersâ, which is due to the fact that the peak blooming season is summer, when thundershowers occur very often. Till today, this plant is used by many people to express the language of love in a special way and it is commonly related to the fifth wedding anniversary. The 'she loves me, she loves me not' famous method of pulling petals to tell loveâs fortune was first used with this flower.
