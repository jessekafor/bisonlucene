        "comment": "I couldn\\'t stand software keyboards until swiping-style came along. I really like Swype, but am happy to have SlideIt, also. It seems as good, and has several strengths, including adjustable keyboard size and very good word recognition and adjustment. A fun addition to my repertoire of excellent typing gadgets.",
