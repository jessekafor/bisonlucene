        "comment": "Marvellous for cc practice, except in the practice game mode where there are card value glitches depending on when a particular upcard appears. E.g. red seven count, black seven is counted as zero when it\\'s the first player upcard, which is correct, but when it\\'s the second it\\'s counted as one?! This sort of nullifies any combined bettting strategy with counting practice and greatly reduces the value of the app. Please fix for 5 stars.",
