        "comment": "Questions are okay, seem very easy overall, but nice if you are out and about with a spare minute. Poorly written with bad grammar, misspelled words, letters left out, etc.; makes it hard to understand some questions. A few obvious answer errors. A better app would cost more, so ok with it.",
