    "description": "ChineseFlashcards allows you to easily study Mandarin Chinese vocabulary.  The words are broken down into 20 units that contain the vocabulary from Cheng & Tsui Integrated Chinese (Level 1 Part 1 & 2).  All cards include Chinese characters and pinyin (with correct tones) on the front and the English translation on the back.  Simply tap to flip a card over and fling (drag your finger across the screen) left or right to switch to a different card.  You can shuffle the cards within a chapter by clicking the menu button and choosing \"shuffle cards\".",
