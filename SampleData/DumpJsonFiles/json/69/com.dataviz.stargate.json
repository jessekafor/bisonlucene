Now I found, like other reviewers, I can\\'t get by the initial registration screen -- I get \\\"No wireless data connection detected\\\" -- pretty ridiculous, since I just downloaded it over the Internet.  Apparently it\\'s now looking for a CELLULAR data connection!  I spent hours scouring the internet, looking through the online manual.  What\\'s ironic is that I have Dataviz\\'s Documents To Go on the same machine, and it re-installed perfectly -- identical registration screen produced no error message.  I read enough to convince me to give up and switch to Touchdown for syncing with my company\\'s MS Exchange server",
