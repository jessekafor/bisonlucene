        "comment": "The 70-680 test currentky as of this date has a pool of over 377 questions. This app only uses 107 and 50% of the questions used in this app have not been updated correctly. Studying for the 70-680 exam using this software is worthless.  Search the Internet and you will quickly learn that the pool of questions for this test has been updated throughout 2013 and even the update done in 2012 are not applied to this app. Worthless!",
