Text messages generated in space travel don\\'t clear fast enough,and end up covering my screen for a while after I\\'ve arrived in port.  How can a game this simple (no animations, turn-based play) feel so much slower on my Motorola XPRT than its ancestor did on my Handspring Edge?  Cut out all the \\\"pretty\\\" junk, and just give me Space Trader!",

Star system buy/sell prices change from the time you view them to the time you arrive; so, then why even provide that info in advance if it is random on arrival anyways?",
