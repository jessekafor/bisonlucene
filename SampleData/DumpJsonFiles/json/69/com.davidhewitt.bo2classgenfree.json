    "description": "This software is not affiliated in any way with Activision or Black Ops 2.BO2 Randomizer is a handy utility to generate random classes for use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Â®.This random class generator supports all weapons, perks, equipment and attachments. It also generates 3 random scorestreaks for every class that you can choose to use if you wish.Please consider purchasing the full version of the app as it helps support the developer while making updates and versions of the app for future games.Benefits over the free version: - No adverts (your one time payment supports the developer) - One click sharing to social media.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidhewitt.bo2classgenThis adds a new level of fun to BO2 because the generator creates classes that you otherwise wouldn't have thought of yourself. Sometimes, it adds an extra level of challenge to the game by giving you weapons with attachments that you don't normally see together.The generator creates you a class for BO2 based on your current player level and your current weapon levels. So it will only give you weapons and attachments that you have already unlocked.",

It would be perfect if a feature was added where we could re-roll individual slots so you could ignore attachments and stuff you have not yet unlocked.  Another thing is when overkill is selected sometimes it doesn\\'t have two weapons equipped. I understand with the pick 10 system it may be awkward to program this into the app, so I am going to give this app a 5 star rating.  P.S. - Thanks for the addition of the option for filling all 10 slots.",
