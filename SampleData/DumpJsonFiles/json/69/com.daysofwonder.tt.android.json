        "comment": "Edit - I have downgraded my score because this literally spanks your battery. An hour of gaming and I have 32% left after full recharge, how is this even possible, add these are local games not even multiplayer. I wish it would save you score.  Would love to see play and pass and blue tooth implemented for local multilayer gaming. Apart from that you also have to keep playing for more maps so if you want all maps is going to cost you near \\302\\24317 for the complete collection which is quite s lot of money imop!",

Actually loads quicker on my N10 than my Core 2 based HTPC.  Edit: Deducted one star due to the hall of fame list resetting whenever the app is closed. Doesn\\'t affect gameplay, but there\\'s really no excuse for that sort of bug in an app this expensive.",

        "comment": "The game play is great but the battery use needs to be improved.  I played on my Galaxy tab 2 7\\\" for about 15 minutes while it was plugged in and charging.  When I started the battery was at about 25% and when I finished it was down to 20%.   Can\\'t imagine what the battery use is if it isn\\'t plugged in.    The game play matchs that of the Ipad and is quite smooth but would like a pass to play feature and the ability to login as different Games of Wonder users would be nice to have separate rankings.  If the battery issue is fixed I would probably give it a 4.  Battery is better here are the 4 stars...",
