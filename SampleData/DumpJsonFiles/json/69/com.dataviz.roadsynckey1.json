Annoyingly, however, it does not retain data in a manner which is conducive to using Nandroids to backup the system, and every time I flashed a new ROM, I\\'d have to completely rebuild the database.  Support was completely unsympathetic to the situation.  Now Sense 3.5 has a better Exchange interface (including tasks) than Datatviz appears to be able to cook up, and having removed the application, I went to install it on my tablet only to learn that I can only run the trial version (even though I\\'ve PAID for the full version).  This is a throwback to the byzantine era of copy protection.   Dataviz oughta know better.  3 stars for a good app for the unadventurous.  Power users should look elsewhere.",
