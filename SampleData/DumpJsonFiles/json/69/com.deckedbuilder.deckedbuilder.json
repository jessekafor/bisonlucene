        "comment": "This app is great, and is very helpful for organizing my deck and my entire collection. However, the description doesn\\'t mention that you will have to pay another $4 to create collections (as opposed to decks) and then another $5 to use the camera feature... All in all, I ended up paying $13 for an app that says it costs $4. That\\'s ridiculous. For $4, can\\'t you just include everything? That\\'s pretty expensive for an app anyway. But if you have $15 to spare, this app is great. 5 stars if no in-app purchases.",

But the UI with the hands and graveyard can switch when you press a \\\"switch player\\\" or past turn button. It shouldn\\'t be difficult to implement. I wouldn\\'t mind paying more for this as an in app unlockable. Any competitive mtg player would find this very useful.",
