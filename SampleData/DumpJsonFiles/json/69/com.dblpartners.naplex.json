        "title": "Worst pharmacy app ever!!",
        "comment": "PLEASE do not waste your money!!! It only contains 7 questions, drugs are spelled wrong, and answers to questions are wrong. One question classifies isoniazid as an MAOI... Wrong. After seeing that, I knew this app was crap. I highly suggest emailing the lousy creators of this app so you can get your money back.. I am. The only reason why I gave it one star is because you can\\'t give it zero stars for ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS AND STUPID.",
