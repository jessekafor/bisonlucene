I can't count the number of times I have had verbal agreements with homeowners, gone ahead and preformed the work that we had agreed upon, only to have the homeowner start negotiating with me after the work has been completed. I have also had one or two times where the homeowner has flat out stiffed me on verbal contracts. iConfirm solves this issue for me. I now simply type in the desired changes into the iConfirm app. the amount that the change will cost and the length of time the change will take. iConfirm then turns this information into a standard change order format and allows me to get a signature from the homeowner directly on my phone. It then emails the clients and myself a copy of the signed change order in PDF format.This app. is a life saver!!!!\" - Mike Hallroan - Hallroan & Powers Construction Inc.  $7.99 per month for iConfirm, or $350 an hour to the law offices of Dewey, Cheatum and Howe.The Choice is clear.iConfirm- Donât Just say it, Sign it.",
