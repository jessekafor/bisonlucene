I own a couple different competing apps i paid for and although i like Docs To Go, i rarely use.in favor of OfficeSuite which allows user to cut and past rich text and images as well as import images from file. Many of us were lead to believenthe.program allowed images to be worked with. It doesnt. Just be aware. If you need word with.ilages use another app. Beside the image.failure, it very good.",
