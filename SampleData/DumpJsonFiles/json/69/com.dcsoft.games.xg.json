    "description": "Relive the 80's in all their glory with XGalaxy--a classic space shooter game for your Android device. Watch out for the enemy aircraft and their firepower as you try to shoot them dead for good. You will start with three ships, and only be allowed to shoot three torpedoes at a time, but as you play, you'll have the opportunity to collect power-ups, which give you additional firepower. With each level you clear, you get increasingly difficult gameplay. So be prepared to hustle to win.- Enjoy shooting and dodging enemy aircraft as you progress through increasingly difficult levels- Challenge yourself to beat global high scores- Compete with your friends using Scoreloop to see who can get the highest score",
