A UI makeover would make this a 5 star app. The oversized control buttons make it less likely to press the wrong one by mistake but they are pretty ugly. The dev did a great job otherwise. One thing to note: don\\'t make the same mistake I did and wonder why it was not connecting. Add a Windows Firewall exception on the computer with Winamp or turn off the Windows Firewall completely if you\\'re behind a home router with its own NAT firewall and don\\'t need it.",

        "comment": "I\\'m looking for an app that will do proper file queuing - not just move the file beneath the current file in the playlist.  WinAmp has a beautiful enqueue feature (Alt+q), why can\\'t this app utilize that instead of moving the song beneath the currently playing song in the playlist?  This is a pain because as you\\'re looking through your playlist and finding songs to play and \\\"Enque\\\" one, the song moves from where it is in the playlist to a new location (below the currently playing song), messing up any order you have in your playlist.  It would be nice to have a separate screen with your queued songs, and allow you to move the songs around in your queue, while keeping your playlist as is and just play songs from your queued list if you create one.  Fix this and I will give it 5 out of 5...  If anyone knows of an app that will do what I\\'m looking for, let me know, but this one doesn\\'t do this yet, hope it will in the future...  I\\'d gladly pay for that feature if it would work well.",
