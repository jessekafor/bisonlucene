        "comment": "I upgraded from PWP 1 to PWP 2 and PWP Android. Once I figured out I needed to purchase two programs (one for Android, one for PC) all welt well in installing PWP and it did a perfect job of accessing my old PWP data - automatically. I have been using it only for a short time, but it seems to take a VERY long time to sync with the \\\"cloud\\\" even after the initial sync. Perhaps there is still something I need to adjust to or learn. The initial sync did take a very long time. I have a large amount of data in PWP, but I would not categorize it as extremely large. I don\\'t know if the sync process will continue even if I close the app on my Android.",

        "comment": "I\\'ve used Passwords Plus on my Palm PDA for years and have always been happy with it. This new version is a worthy successor and the sync function with Windows is easier than the old Hotsync used to be. However, it is actually possible to make the elementary mistake of losing the master password: I did it:-( If this happens, and you have to start over again with both programs (Windows and Android) it can work, but you have to give another email address in order to receive a new sync number. Customer Support never reacted to my request for help, and I had to discover this for myself. For this reason, I\\'ll give the app 4 stars.",

        "comment": "I use this fine on my Asus Transformer Infinity  tablet just fine.  BUT when I load the program on my other Google Nexus 7 tablet, there is no search capability, or even sorting by categories -- both of these features work on my Transformer tablet, so I\\'m not sure why they don\\'t work on the Nexus 7.  I\\'ve also had 1 hiccup on cloud synchronization where a poor connection during sync resulted in a deleted record...otherwise synchronization has worked well with my Windows PC.  (It would\\'ve been nice to have an undo feature that reverted back to before sync.)  So overall this is a promising program, but it needs a few tweaks.",
