Automatic scan of your home network over Ethernet or Wifi to identify PC, NAS or any other device running UPnP/DLNA media server.2. Shows capabilities of the scanned servers by dividing them into two categories, one from which you can serve content i.e. called Play From and others to which you can play that content i.e. called Play To.3. Use MediaHouse Pro as a browser, player or controller. 4. MediaHouse Pro can control playback of content from a Media Server (called - Play From) to a Media renderer (called - Play To).5.
