        "comment": "Good job USTA!!!   Now parents and coaches who don\\'t think the using red, orange and green balls are \\\"real\\\" tennis should certainly see that the progressions make sense and that these kids are hitting \\\"real\\\" shots and playing on age appropriate courts with age appropriate equipment.  After all - they don\\'t play T-ball on Yankee stadium with professional size equipment :-)",
