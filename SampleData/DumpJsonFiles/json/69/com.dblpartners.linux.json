        "comment": "This is app is a rip off for the price. The question pool is ridiculously small. Many of the questions aren\\'t actual exam objectives either. Most of the questions it does have that actually do relate to Linux+ are only for LX0-101. If this was free it\\'d be a worthwhile download. If you actually want good questions, go to LPIC\\'s website, they have links to sites they themselves believe are helpful with pretests and test prepping (and those practice tests and resources are free and actually worthwhile).",
