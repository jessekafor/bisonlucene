        "comment": "This is a great game for killing time! The camera control is very fluid unlike the previous game, the camera manages to follow your tank where ever you traverse. The motion control is fluid as well and you can negotiate the terrain and take a direct hit at the enemy with ease. Since there is only one objective as in the previous one, the game soon turns to be monotonous and some gamers may not feel to continue playing for long. The new additions are nice and adds more excitement to the game. Graphics are pretty decent, music is amazing and the sound effects adds a good touch to the game play.   If you\\'re looking something to simply kill time, download it. If you\\'re looking for something more in the game then look elsewhere.    My verdict: a good game and worth a download, especially for those who prefer a no strings attached simple hack and slash kind of game.  The developers should add more objectives in future releases. An option to upgrade your tank (upgrading the main cannon, different types of ammo, armour, shells, etc) would also be nice, better still if there are options to choose your tanks as well. Different kind of power ups would add more variety and depth to the game.",
