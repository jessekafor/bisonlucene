    "description": "*** Please read all instructions carefully. ***Not all devices are supported, therefore it is strongly recommended that you try the 'Sixaxis Compatibility Checker' (available for free in the Android Market) before purchasing this app.Finally the wait is over... The ultimate gaming experience awaits! Now you can play games on your phone the way they were meant to be played! Sixaxis Controller allows you to use your Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers in many of your favourite games and applications.*** IMPORTANT ***- ROOT access is required!!!- Due to the way pairing is done with the controllers, you need to manually pair your controller with the PC utility 'SixaxisPairTool' (available on the website) and a mini-USB cable. Android 3.1+ users can also pair directly on their devices via USB.- It is highly recommended that you use an ORIGINAL controller. Many after market controllers will not work with this app. If you get a 'Client connected: 1' message, but the lights on your controller continue to flash, it is almost certainly not an original Sony controller.- The fake controllers that are most likely to work (though not guaranteed) are those made by Gasia. If you bought a fake that works but isn't made by Gasia, I'd love to hear from you so I can compile a list of known working controllers.- Be sure to read the instructions in the help menu carefully.Features:- Up to four Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers supported at once.- Support as a native gamepad in Android 3.1+ devices. Full support for analog sticks and analog triggers.- Keyboard emulation. Map all buttons and sticks to almost any key available in Android.- Mouse emulation. Configure a button to activate the mouse pointer on devices that support mice (most tablets, and many phones should work).- Touch emulation allows you to map buttons and analog sticks to the screen. Play all your favourite games with full analog support, even those without built-in controller support!This product is not affiliated with, nor authorized, endorsed or licensed in any way by Sony Corporation, its affiliates or subsidiaries.

        "comment": "I have a nexus 7 (2013) and the app works great with games that have the gampad mode but games like N.O.V.A 3 OR Modern Combat 4 it doesn\\'t work correctly even if I make the profile and enable it. Some buttons do work but I can\\'t aim with my right analog or any other button for that matter. I followed all the steps just like I did with my s3 witch in that case it  works flawlessly. I guess it needs to be updated for the nexus 7 (2013)",

        "comment": "Would be nice to be able to attach touch profiles to apps so you don\\'t have to switch them. The attachment should be saved in the touch profile file for easier sharing.  And the Profiles editor should automatically save the background picture as \\\"profilename\\\".png aside the profile files so it is easy to pack both files.  Or better a zip format to export / import profiles with a custom extension like \\\"profil.sixzip\\\" and a intend to open *.sixzip and import the profil. So the user only have to click a profile file in the browser and it gets imported in sixaxis.",

I have followed the instructions to the letter but I am still unable to connect my original PS3 controller to my Asus TF201. I am experiencing the same problem that a previous reviewer had. When rewriting the Bluetooth drivers it completely disables my Bluetooth and will not allow it to turn back on. I am also unable to turn it back on via the settings when I close the sixaxis program. The program hangs on a command line within the program that states: Listening for devices. Nothing changes in 10 minutes time. Compatibility mode states my device is supported. I am running CyanogenMod 10.1 on a JB 4.2 shell.",
