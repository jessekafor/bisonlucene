        "comment": "I really like the way this app does events you can vote on them and it works very well. However, it has no tracking for ongoing or recurring events . For example I run a weekly Dungeons and Dragons night but because of scheduling, peoples attendance always changes it would be helpful if we could set up a recurring event and go on the time as well not just on one event.",

With Deci, you\\'ll create the event by setting a date, add friends by pulling them from your Facebook contacts, and finally add up to four places from your immediate area. Once these have been added, your added friends can vote on which venue to attend. You can send messages back and forth to debate, but the main section of Deci makes it easy to see the choices and who has already voted. It\\'s an intriguing idea, and only time will bear out whether it gets adopted at large, but it\\'s executed simply enough for everyone to easily understand how to use it. Download Deci today, and decide whether or not it\\'s for you. -- via Best Apps Market",
