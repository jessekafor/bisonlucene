It is the art form that communicates through the body. It is an integral part of the live and recorded performing arts and cultural industries. It is often collaborative and provides creative and work opportunities for artists working in a range of other art forms including music, film or theatre. In addition, dancers and choreographers frequently contribute to other art forms.Born in the early 20th century, modern dance is a style that centers on a dancer's own interpretations instead of structured steps, as in traditional ballet dancing. Modern dancers reject the limitations of classical ballet and favor movements derived from the expression of their inner feelings. They are encouraged to use their emotions and moods to design their own steps and routines. It is not unusual for them to invent new steps for their routines, instead of following a structured code of technique, as in ballet. They tend to use dancing to express their innermost emotions, often to get closer to their inner-selves. Before attempting to choreograph a routine, the modern dancer decides which emotions to try to convey to the audience. They tend to choose a subject near and dear to their hearts, such as a lost love or a personal failure. The dancer will choose music that relates to the story they wish to tell, or choose to use no music at all, and then choose a costume to reflect their chosen emotions. Watch various pictures of greatest performers and their exquisite movements on stage! Make you new ideal dance wallpaper!",
