        "comment": "Accent On Nature is a Brick & Mortar Store in Columbus Ohio specializing in Rocks, Crystals, Gemstones, Meteorites, Fossils, Sea Shells, Jewelry, Gifts & Much More, We have often had people ask us for a good mobile app for Crystals and Stones and for a long time there was nothing out there. We were considering publishing one of our own, but then the Crystal Guide Pocket Edition hit the Play Store and after getting it and trying it out we decided to endorse it as a great addition to any smartphone or tablet for our customers, linking it to our website and sharing on our Facebook & Twitter accounts. We love that it provides both Science and Metaphysical Information with good pictures and the ability to search the entire App by multiple criteria. We also love the warnings about handling of minerals too, something we feel is often overlooked in other publications. Just a superb reference for the modern collector and buyer of Rocks, Minerals & Crystals!",
