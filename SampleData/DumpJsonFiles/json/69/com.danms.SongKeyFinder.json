        "comment": "The app simply does not work. It force closes every time you select \\'listen\\' to analyze a track. As a developer, my guess would be the file size and possibly too many tasks occurring at once (within the app) are causing the force close. Very disappointing, and it goes without saying that this is a waste of time. I\\'m not sure if the pro version would be any better or not, but if they cannot even make a functioning app I doubt the other versions would be any different. Tested on an LG E-739.",
