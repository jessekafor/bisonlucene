However, there is still some way to go with this app.  I previously logged in to the web version with my LinkedIn profile but the mobile app version doesn\\'t allow this so I had to create a new profile - which it then said was invalid but let me log in anyway!  I am sure they will sort this stuff out. Congrats for getting so much entertainment in one place especially for places other than London.  Well done and keep up the good work!  Wants: ability to store location and date preferences (\\\"near me\\\" doesn\\'t work.. near me!), better calendar synchronisation etc",
