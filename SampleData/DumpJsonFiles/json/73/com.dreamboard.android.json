Also, if the devs ever update the app, would you be kind enough to include what\\'s new in what version just so we would know.",

Go on...I\\'ll wait.  \\\"Log your dreams on your mobile when you wake by selecting a simple set of options\\\"  Yep, then watch the app suddenly drop you back to the login screen and you\\'re left with a dream you\\'ve only managed to describe as \\\"neutral\\\" and \\\"orange\\\".  \\\"Create, annotate and browse your private personal dream journal.\\\"  Note the absence of the word \\\"edit\\\". Did the app die, or unexpectedly drop you back to the login screen, while you were adding your dream? Hope you\\'re happy to just \\\"annotate\\\" or \\\"browse\\\" the thing you listed as \\\"neutral\\\" and \\\"orange\\\", then. I mean, sure...you could just delete it and start again, but you know...that really is not the point, is it?  \\\"Observe trends in their dreaming activity.\\\"  Well, when I have a week\\'s worth of dreams listed wherein all I\\'ve managed to record is the f**king colour, watching trends develop should be a real revelation. Thanks for that.  Go elsewhere.",
