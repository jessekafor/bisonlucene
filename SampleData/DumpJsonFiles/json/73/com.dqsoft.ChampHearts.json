        "comment": "This is hands down the best Hearts for tablet I\\'ve seen, and I\\'ve tried a bunch. The original Android release had some problems -- hence the early three bad reviews -- but the new version works like a charm.  Whenever I have the bucks, I spring for the paid version, because I\\'m not too fond of ads. Since I\\'ve used the PC version of this app for a decade, I immediately bought the upgrade package. I knew it would be worth it, and it is. So I don\\'t know how \\\"spoiled\\\" the game is by the ads. That\\'s just how it goes in the Android App world. Free means ads, \\'cause there ain\\'t no free lunch! (^_^)",

This Free version includes very limited features and the entry level Bots are horrible players which will ruin your game strategy if u play too long (or are just starting out).  Game worked fine on GS2, but the Free version is simply not worth playing.    I also found the cards difficult to DragNDrop (which i dont experience from other developers such as Aces).  Full version 15 day trial better sales pitch.",
