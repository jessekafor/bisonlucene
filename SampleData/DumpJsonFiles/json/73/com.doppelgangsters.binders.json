    "description": "Reminisce upon the U.S. Presidential Election of 2012! Follow presidential candidate Willard \"Mitt\" Romney on his \"race\" to the White House. Bolster the economy by trapping woman into binders. Watch out for the parasitic Forty-seven Percent, who seek to steal the government's money and will stop at nothing until your offshore accounts are accounted for. Along the way, big birds from \"The Street\" will seek to end your presidency before it even begins. Dodge these obstacles with the influential affluence of a billionaire like yourself: by throwing money at the poor and dawning a jet pack that literally burns through wads of cash! Only you can help snag the Women's vote and win the election!",
