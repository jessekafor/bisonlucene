    "description": "An    immersive    journey    through    mystical    sounds,    arranged    according    to    the    Keys    of    Pythagoras...  Brought  to  you  by  internationally  recognized  brainwave  entrainment  audio  expert,  Leigh  Spusta. Experience    the    expansion    of    your    consciousness    into    new    realms    of    imagery,    insight,    awareness,    and    greater    connection    to    the    Universe.    As    you    sit    back    and    take    in    the    mind-enhancing    and    calming    soundscape,    your    mind    begins    to    shift,    responding    in    interesting    new    ways    to    the    changing    musical    landscape.    Your    body    awareness    begins    to    disappear    into    the    distant    background    as    your    journey    deepens,    progressing    further    and    further    into    a    heightened    state    of    awareness,    where    you    can    begin    to    explore    the    meaning    of    things,    understand    the    connections    and    events    in    Life,    or    tap    into    the    unfolding    and    expanding    realm    of    intuitive    and    psychic    awareness.    This    is    one    of    Leigh's    most    powerful    soundscapes    for    moving    consciousness    out    of    the    confines    of    normal,    everyday    awareness,    and    it    makes    a    perfect    tool    for    hypnosis,    meditation,    shamanism,    magic,    spirituality    and    self-discovery.    Each    note    in    this    soundscape    has    been    tuned    to    the    frequency    and    interval    ratios    provided    by    the    Greek    philosopher    /    healer    Pythagoras,    so    that    each    sound    resonates    in    alignment    and    harmony    with    the    natural    laws    of    the    universe    and    all    creation.    This    serves    to    promote    healing,    wholeness,    and    harmony,    and    also    an    atonement    of    consciousness    to    the    perfect    order    of    the    Universe.    In    combination    with    the    special    brainwave    entrainment    methods    of    the    PsimatiXÂª    proprietary    audio    technology,    this    is    a    very    potent    and    special    40    minute    SoundScape.    This app streams via 3G or wifi connection. Leigh    Spusta    is    a    behavioral    scientist,    hypnotherapist,    and    Certified    Therapeutic    Imagery    Facilitator    specializing    in    the    use    of    sound    frequencies    to    produce    deep,    relaxing    trance    states.    He    has    worked    with    several    therapists    in    Los    Angeles,    producing    a    variety    of    therapeutic    audio    cds.    Leigh    combines    his    talents    as    a    musician    and    his    knowledge    of    hypnosis    and    related    states,    in    an    effort    to    pioneer    new    approaches    in    creating    rich,    resonant    sound-scapes    for    greater    efficacy    in    healing    and    meditative    products.
