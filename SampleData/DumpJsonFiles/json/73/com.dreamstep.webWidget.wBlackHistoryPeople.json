        "comment": "He\\'s absurd. Blacks had pushed the agenda of racial equality than any other race in America. Equality and freedom is what America ia about. I\\'m surprised in the description Malcolm X or Marcus Garvey isn\\'t included. Two of the most noble, controversial Black American leaders the world has ever laid eyes on. By far Malcolm X was a more powerful speaker than any named here also. This mentions Barrack Obama in the politics section but he doesn\\'t even represent blacks. Hes taking away everyones civil liberties.",
