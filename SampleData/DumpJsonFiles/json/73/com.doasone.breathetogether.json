        "comment": "Do as one has been my quick relaxation break from the daily grind for years, it\\'s wonderful to see a mobile version that I can take with me. This morning I had the pleasure of breathing with hundreds around the world from my car on my drive into work. Just fantastic. Side by side with my computer the orbs sync up in perfect unison, and the simple interface makes it easy to use. The mapping feature is pretty slick makes it is easy to see the people I am breathing with from around the globe. Great job.",

        "comment": "I\\'ve used the website many times and think it\\'s a fantastic concept so had high hopes for the app.  The app seems to have captured the basic interface but there don\\'t seem to be any customisation features like the website has for setting a timer for example.  Quite a critical flaw is that it seems to stop when the screen blacks out.  So if your phone dulls the screen after an amount of time to save on power you will not be able to use this without disabling this.  This could be something which is only a problem on my phone because my phone locks shortly after the screen going black.  The app definitely has potential but at this stage it\\'s still buggy.",
