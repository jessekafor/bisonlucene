    "description": "Tech Support AppLooking For Developer Groups to join in android Projects! My name is Rafael Fontana Santana. I am 28 years old and naturally from Brazil. I moved to America in 2008; speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish. I have a bachelors in business, graduated in 2005, and went to a graduate program for Logistics. Then I moved to the states with the purpose of improving on the English language. Since I was twelve years old computers have always been an important part of my life. I am running my own computer repair business for about a year. The first two years in Florida, I studied English at Eckerd College for 5 months as a second language, then applied for a BS of international business at SPC, where it took two years but then I got my diploma validated here in the states which made me decide to join the work force rather then add to my first degree. I am currently working on my own with computer repair, web design and web development. I have been studying online marketing for local business listing SEO (search engine optimization) in past 6 months , I have some projects done such as,http://www.maggiesmaid.com http://www.tampamotorcyclesale.comhttp://www.cacallbrasil.com http://www.electrozoneusa.com http://www.rypcs.comI can fix any laptop or desktop, also apple machines are fine.
