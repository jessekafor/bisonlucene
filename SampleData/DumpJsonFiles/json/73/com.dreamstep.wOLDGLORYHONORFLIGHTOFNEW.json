    "description": "OLD GLORY HONOR FLIGHT OF NEWWelcome  to  Old  Glory  Honor  Flight,  the  Northeast  Wisconsin  hub  of  the  Honor  Flight  Network.    Our  mission  is  to  offer  World  War  II  veterans  a  memorable,  safe  and  rewarding  tour  of  honor  to  our  Nation's  Capital. Each  Honor  Flight  departs  Northeast  Wisconsin  and  returns  on  the  same  day  after  visiting  several  sites  around  Washington,  DC.    Most  importantly,  the  veterans  are  able  to  visit  those  memorials  dedicated  in  their  honor  including  the  World  War  II  Memorial,  the  Iwo  Jima  Memorial,  the  Korean  War  Memorial,  and  the  Vietnam  War  Memorial,  as  well  as  Arlington  National  Cemetery.    The  World  War  II  Memorial  was  recently  dedicated  in  2004,  and  far  too  many  of  our  Nation's  heroes  never  had  the  chance  to  visit  their  memorial.Our  flights  have  one  guardian  for  every  two  veterans  to  take  care  of  their  needs  throughout  the  day.    A  medical  staff  including  a  doctor  and  several  nurses  are  available  if  needed.  Wheelchairs  and  all  meals  are  also  provided.    Discounted  hotel  rates  are  available  for  those  traveling  from  out  of  town.    If  you  wish  to  go  along  on  the  flight  as  a  veteran  or  guardian,  please  click  'Applications'  to  the  left  and  download  the  appropriate  application.Please  contact  us  if  you  have  any  questions.    Because  this  is  an  all-volunteer  organization,  our  phone  line  is  not  answered  by  a  live  person  so  leave  a  message  or  send  an  e-mail.
