For example, trying to change the HP of Monsters is slow and unresponsive . also you should support multiple different kinds of monsters in 1 section from multiple levels.(like a riding dog @ lv1 and an octopus from lv 2) Also a few newer feat options are available for druid ( moonlight and sunlight summons) making those options available would be sweet as well. overall great and helpful",

On the down side, there\\'s no way for it to track multiple different summon spells at once, and it still doesn\\'t have the new elementals & templates that were introduced in the Bestiary II.",
