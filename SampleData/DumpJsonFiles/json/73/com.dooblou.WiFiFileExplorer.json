        "comment": "the ONLY thing you can do is d/l files from your phone to your pc with this app. you have to buy the full version to be able to u/l even one file from your phone to your pc. its slow and clumsy, and actually slower overall than moving files across a cable via usb, or across bluetooth. if you go to the developers facebook page and say anything negative like this, you get your post deleted, and you get banned from the page so you can never post again. That sort of childish behavior ensures he has only postive things on his facebook page. That there tells you of the childish character of the developer. do yourself a favor, transfer files via bluetooth or usb cable... its not like a cable cost $40",
