    "description": "8 News NOW, KLAS-TV Las Vegas, NV, has one of the largest Investigative departments of any TV station in the country. The 8 News NOW I-Team is led by legendary Investigative reporter George Knapp. Since 1995, George has been the chief reporter on Channel 8's I-Team investigative unit. He has earned five regional Edward R. Murrow awards and a national Edward R. Murrow award for his investigative stories on the voter registration fraud in the Clark County election of 2004. Knapp has won a prestigious Peabody Award and 19 Emmy Awards. Nine times, he has won the Mark Twain Award for best news writing from the Associated Press. And in 1990, his series about UFOs was selected by United Press International as best in the nation for Individual Achievement by a Journalist. The \"Knapp App\" features latest investigative reports from the I-Team, as well as a wealth of historical reports in Las Vegas and throughout Nevada on such topics as Area 51 and the Nevada test site, the plight of Nevada's wild horses, organized crime in Las Vegas, the highly contentious issue of water rights, and public corruption.",
