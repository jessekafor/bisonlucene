    "description": "I've added a screenshot of all of the dungeon armors available in GW2 for each race and gender. You just select the dungeon, race, armor class (light/medium/heavy), and gender and this app does the rest.There are a ton more features planned and I'm ALWAYS open to new ideas. So leave a comment or an email and I'll try to implement anything you guys think would help!Hopefully by the end of this week I will have all of the dungeon WEAPONS added as well, and begin working on the cultural and karma sets.Eventually this app will not house the images itself as it will begin to be a bit unwieldy so stay tuned for changes.",

        "comment": "You wanted ideas. Maybe a little over ambitious..But we need 360 rotatable 3d models. Pinch zooming. Individual armor databases where we can mix and match coats, boots, gloves, etc from all the armor sets, color customization.. Stats added as well for all armour sets. I know that would be overwhelming but I know you can do it! You need funding though for a true portable replica of the locker for GW2 and hire on some talent... I would definitely donate.",

I know it\\'s already on a website but I can\\'t access it readily and have to pinch zoom on my mobile browser, just one of those mini mini mini inconveniences. Much thanks though. This is really great so I know which dungeons to plow through.",
