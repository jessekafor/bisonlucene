Originally developed by Seibu Kaihatsu, each of these classic scrolling shooters has not only been authentically recreated for mobile, but also enhanced with brand-new features! MORE OPTIONS! Each RAIDEN LEGACY title includes three different modes: âArcade Modeâ (just like the original); âMission Modeâ, which allows you to play any unlocked stage; and âTraining Modeâ, which, true to its name, allows you to excel at your favorite stages and practice the most difficult ones! MORE SHIPS! 15+ different ships, each with their own characteristics, stats, weapons, and specials! Also, some ships come complete with âcharged shotsâ â useful for when the screen is 90% covered with enemies! MORE CONTROLS! Choose between two different touch modes: âFast Touchâ (Faster than the original game and improved for mobiles) or âArcade Touchâ (Just like the original â retrogamers will love it!). Whatâs more, you can customize your approach by putting the controls wherever you prefer on screen. MORE FEATURES! -Play in full-screen, or keep the gameâs original screen ratio thanks to âOriginal Modeâ (note that your fingers will be outside the game area). -AutoFire: ON/OFF -Two difficulty modes: Medium and Hard. -Nine languages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese -Video filtering (for rich, smooth graphics) -ScoreLoop compatible: 15 unlockable achievements + online leaderboards.

I\\'ve tried on 3g, 4g, and wifi, all of which work on every other application. I\\'ve even tried uninstalling completely then reinstalling. Please fix this.  Edit: The file it always errors on is \\\"rdft2_gfxdata2.bin\\\".  Update: Thanks to the patch, I was able to install it.",

Good stuff, intense and satisfying on short trips. I dropped it to 4 stars because sometimes the game can become stuttery and unresponsive at very inopportune moments.",
