    "description": "Very simple tool for calculating your 1 to 15 repetition max when planning your weightlifting or bodyweight training. Also does conversions between kilograms, pounds, pood and bodyweight percentage.Just enter your weight lifted for any strength exercise with repetitions in the range 1RM (repetition max) to your 15RM. It then calculates and displays all your expected max weights in the same range. Works great for bench press, deadlift, squat, shulder press. A new option to include your bodyweight in the calculations gives more accurate results for bodyweight exercises like pull ups, push ups, muscle ups, etc.The fact that this app not only calculates your 1RM, but the full range between 1RM and 15RM makes this a great tool for creating any wave or periodization strength prorgrams.Results are calculated using a formula based on statistics. Should be accurate for most people and strength exercises.Free, no weird permissions needed & NO ADS!If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please send me an e-mail before giving negative rating.",
