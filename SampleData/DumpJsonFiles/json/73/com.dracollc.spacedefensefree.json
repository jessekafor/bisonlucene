This gives a MAJOR difference as it gives u more time before the enemy ships hit ur base.. I have paid for ad free and bought additional items, I would like this to be addressed or at least reply giving an answer if this is a known fault................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. Response to reply: I will take a screen shot of my phone playing the game and a tablet and also another HTC phone. I find your response to be very patronizing as if I am not telling the truth!! I wouldn\\'t just think of something to diss this game, I actually found playing it very fun!! BTW I completed it just yesterday, when are you releasing more levels?",
