By using this app you get information such as :- If thereÂ´s a queue and how long it takes to come in.- What type of music they play there right now.- If there is a lot of people inside.2) You can use it as a club/pub researcher. The Application has a Google GPS system that shows your location on a map and the nightclubs around you.
