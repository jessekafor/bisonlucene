    "description": "Overly realistic 3 D blocks were broken down, and the game came out!! There is no game of this quality for nothing. The first feeling of operation is unbearable. With no killing-time game NO.1 mistake!! In fact ... What is broken down is not only a block. Up to a block, a wooden board, brick, a wooden box, a drum, an oil can, a chair, a table, a tire, a vending machine, what, and a motorbike. Anything is broken!! The realistic motion by the physical operation of a Doppelganger Inc. no one but is living. Further!! The production which the BASH BLOCK cannot consider is a large number!! \"Do balls increase in number to two pieces??\" It can say and say. -- \"Are they three pieces??\" It can say and say. -- \"Are they four pieces???\" It can say and say. -- \"Are they five pieces!!! !\" He does not say and remember!! Anyhow, it is full!! \"Does a ball also double large??\" It can say and say. -- \"-- obtaining -- by no means -- Also this -- ??\" Yes, it does not understand!! It becomes very large!!! If it does, it understands!!",
