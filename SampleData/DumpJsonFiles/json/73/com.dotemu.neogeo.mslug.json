The buttons are way to big and take up more than half of the screen, and there\\'s no way to resize the buttons trust me i checked. Fix this issue please. It\\'s totally unplayable, if anyone is aware of a fix for this please message me. Overall i\\'m very disappointed, anyone know how i can get a refund for all the metal slug games i bought???",

First and most important, I\\'m running this on a Nexus 4, and I feel there really shouldn\\'t be any slowdown. Yeah the arcade games did have some slowdown, and I\\'m okay with that but this is not on the same level with some  stutters on occasion too. Also, I know I\\'m playing on a touch screen so I can forgive the not so precise controls, but I\\'m really hoping an update to be able to use a controller to play.",
