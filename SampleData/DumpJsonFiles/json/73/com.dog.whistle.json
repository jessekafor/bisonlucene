        "comment": "Really needs a better way to use the whistle.  Having to use the scroll bar every time isn\\'t practical, especially if I only need a short burst whistle, not a sustained whistle.  Add some pre set frequencies with the ability for whistle to be as short or long as needed and this will be a 5 star app.  Good job on the permissions, btw.",
