This is potentially a great app, good work so far!  EDIT: I lowered my rating, changed the title and shortened the original comment.  I have a concern about the author\\'s use of the money from the purchase of this app.  I have made the purchase, because I want the audio.  But three times I asked where the money goes, and I was never given an answer, even when other questions from the same email were answered.  Does he not want to answer?  Why?  Shouldn\\'t he be proudly displaying that the money is going to Kofu Fund?  That he\\'s supporting the SGI organization with the money generated by his app?  Or is that not happening, and he\\'s just pocketing the cash?  That goes against the ethics and principles of SGI, no doubt he knows it.  I urge the author to start making donations to the Kofu Fund equal to or greater than the money being generated from this app.  Until he does so and shows that he\\'s doing it, I urge any future users *not* to purchase the full version of this app.  The free version is good enough to track your goals.",
