        "comment": "I like the ability (with the cloud connector add-on) to sync lists with multiple users. The online list editing tool is helpful, although somewhat awkward to use, and the metadata editing features are useful. What I\\'d like to see in a future release is either sub-categories or hierarchical listings; for example, a large shipping case might have several smaller cases inside it, each with its own list of contents. That addition would take this app closer to an industrial-level app.",
