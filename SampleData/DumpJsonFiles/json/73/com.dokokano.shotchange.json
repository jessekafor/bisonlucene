    "description": "Aiming and avoiding by one finger.2D shooting game where it can play by one hand.A game with unique pleasant operativity.## operation ##Since it aimed at that it could be operated single hand (one finger), its operation method is somewhat peculiar.First of all, please practice by a tutorial.[Movement]If a screen is touched and it moves (swipe), a red marker will move according to a finger.He pursues a marker and moves.* Don't care about the position which touches a screen anywhere.If the black portion which is not displayed at all is used, a screen will not hide easily with a finger.[Attack]When moving oneself, a screen is touched, but aim is set to the place in which he was present when it touches.From itself, a cartridge is discharged towards aim.Even if he moves, the position of aim remains as it is.Thereby, a cartridge can be shot in the free direction.If a hand is lifted from a screen, aim will disappear and shooting will also stop.There is the following as a technique of how to use aim.- Place aim near yourself.  -> Since the shooting direction changes simply by moving oneself, it turns to attacking the wide range.- Separate aim from yourself and place it.  -> an angle can be adjusted precisely.- Place aim near the enemy.  -> Even if it moves in order to avoid    enemy's cartridge, a cartridge is discharged toward an enemy.    It turns to attacking a boss and a hard enemy.Since it can replace at any time, please use aim properly flexibly.## ZEEMOTE JS1 CONTROLLER ##zeemote eneble at setting screen.use joystick(MOVE) and A button(SHOT)## MENU #### others ##ï½¥When the track ball is pushed, it is a temporary stop.
