        "comment": "In addition to the other comments, this app does not compute calories properly. It seems to arbitrarily set your daily calorie lifestyle exertion merely enough to offset your exercise exertion.  Also, food entry is weak in comparison to MyFitnessPal. And I can\\'t get exercise samples to show up unless I guess the name properly. I can\\'t find or open a list of exercises. Sponsored by Crunch, such a shame. Crunch should just use MyFitnessPal with their trainers.",
