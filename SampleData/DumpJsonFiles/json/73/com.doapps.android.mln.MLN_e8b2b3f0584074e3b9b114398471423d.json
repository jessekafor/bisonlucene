        "comment": "If you\\'re going to say TEXAS in your title, you should include ALL of it like Central Texas, East Texas, the Valley, West Texas, etc.  Houston and Dallas do NOT constitute all of Texas.  And what\\'s the point of options that simply take you to a mobile website?  (i.e. college standings). I can do that on my browser.  And why would I EVER need Houston news scrolling across the screen when 1) I don\\'t live there and 2) WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH FOOTBALL!!!.  And Bios of Houston news staff (again, people that have nothing to do with football)    Overall the app is very slow and many of the web pages came up not available (again, why am I directed to a web page?)  Perhaps it\\'s the ads that run in the background or maybe the poor coding.  Maybe it\\'s because KHOU got a developer from Minnesota who doesn\\'t know anything about Texas or football.  Even if I still lived in Houstin, I wouldn\\'t use this app.    It\\'s sad the developer had to get their friends to rate it 5 stars and artificially inflate its rating.  There are much better ones out there.  I would have given it 0 stars but it has a nice picture of the hot weather chick Chita Johnson.",

I would bet my life there are many small town athletes that would make many of your bigger city kids be envious.  I installed this app... and uninstalled it immediately.",
