This app is super simple, but does what it needs to. I highly suggest this app if you\\'re looking for a simple packing list app! If I could give a suggestion: It would be great if we could create a account, or even use our Google accounts, so we can access our lists on other devices. Keep up the great work!",

        "comment": "This is the best packing list app for android I\\'ve come across but it\\'s lacking certain features that would make it truly useful to me:  1. Calculate and display total weights next to categories and have this value be dynamically updated as items are checked/unchecked. Being able to see weights of categories allows a more detailed understanding of where the weight is distributed. The current implementation only shows total weights when sorting by luggage and even then it doesn\\'t dynamically update. This makes it useless, especially since I only carry one bag.  2. Subitems. Sometimes I want to breakdown certain items even further. e.g. Health category -> First aid kit item -> Contents of first aid kit subitems. Adding that one level would make a huge difference.  As it is, this app is so close to being what I need but not quite there yet. Add these features and you\\'ve got yourself a customer.",
