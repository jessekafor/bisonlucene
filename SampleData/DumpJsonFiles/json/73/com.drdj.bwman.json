    "description": "** No Limit of Level and Speed! ** ** Play Forever if You Can! ** ** Novel Meets Game! ** ** From iPhone 2 Android **\"Red, Blue, Green! Find your own lost colors!\" Because of the polluted sun, our hero has lost his colors and turned black and white. We call him a \"B/W(Black and White) Man.\" Can he find his true colors and come back to a normal guy, \"Color Man?\" It is totally up to you! and your magical finger move! This unique concept of game is based on a SF fantasy novel, \"The Birth of B/W Man\" by Xris Sohn. 1. Look at the colored suns in the upper part of the game screen. 2. Touch the corresponding colored characters in order. - If you touch a wrong character, the color of our hero will fade gradually and become a B/W Man. - Hero has 5 lives. - Has endless levels, so aim for the highest score and compare with other players on Openfeint. - The colored suns sometimes quickly switch with question marks, so be sure to memorize them.
