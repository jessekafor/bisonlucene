    "description": "Your phone must be rooted to use this app!! Again, ROOT PERMISSION IS REQUIRED TO RUN THIS APP!A simple application to schedule reboots for your phone on a daily basis. Schedule options include; reboot, hot reboot and power down. If using hot reboot for scheduling, you must first hit the button and accept the superuser permission.App contains buttons to power your phone off, reboot, hot reboot, reboot to bootloader and reboot to recovery.App currently contains an enable/disable widget with more widgets coming soon. Also am going to be adding more scheduling options in the near future. App layout looks best on XHDPI phone displays.Options:* Reboot on button press.* Reboot to bootloader.* Reboot to recovery.* Power the phone off (shut down).* Hot reboot (reboot system, much faster than reg reboot).* Schedule time for reboot, hot reboot or shutdown.* Turn on or off reboot confirmations with button press.* Persistent notification option.* Turn on or off startup toast notifications.* Backup your schedule.* Restore schedule.Permissions:*Storage - modify/delete SD card contents: this is to backup your schedule to SDcard.*Phone calls - read phone state and identity: used to see if user is on a phone call.*System tools - automatically start at boot: this is for the app to schedule the next reboot.",
