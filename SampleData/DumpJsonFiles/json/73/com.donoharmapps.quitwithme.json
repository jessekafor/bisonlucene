    "description": "The first social app to help smokers quit!It's no secret that smoking is harmful. You hear it all the time from friends, family, your doctors. Every day you see Surgeon General's warnings and anti-smoking commercials. You read news stories about the latest studies implicating tobacco in emphysema, asthma, heart disease, cancer. These are things you already know -- you don't need to hear them again. You don't need to be scolded, \"Why can't you just quit?\" You don't need to be yelled at, lectured, hypnotized or brainwashed. You need support -- not from people who run anti-smoking campaigns, and not from people who don't smoke. To really quit, you need support from people who have successfully quit or are trying to quit just like you. We believe Quit With Me can deliver that support.Quit With Me is the first social app to help smokers quit. By inviting buddies to quit with you, you can build a network of support as you chart your own progress towards being smoke-free. Log your daily cigarette use, and then check in on your buddies' progress. Your friend cut back by 3 cigarettes yesterday? Congratulate them with a free gift! And then try to match their success -- hey, a little healthy competition never hurt, especially when it comes to quitting! We believe what goes around comes around. Day by day, the encouragement and support you give your friends will come back to you, and your success will inspire your friends. And in the end, these are the things that matter the most. If you're ready to quit, you don't need to go it alone. Try out Quit With Me, and bring some friends along.",
