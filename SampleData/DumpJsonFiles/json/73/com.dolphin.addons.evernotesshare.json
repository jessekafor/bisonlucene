        "comment": "This used to be my favorite app. I used it all the time. Originally you could click the evernote  icon any time you were browsing the web and it would copy the web page you were on directly  into evernote. Now when I click on it I continually get error messages saying the page is too big or the app is unsupportted or something. It just stopped working for some reason. There is another app, evernote clipper, that works but it is a real nuisance to use because it is not embedded in a fully-functioning browser so you have to copy and paste your url into it to save it.",

        "comment": "The add-on is a must for Evernote/Dolphin users, yet it only works sporadically now.  I usually get a \\\"failed\\\" or \\\"page too large\\\" error, though it used to work beautifully.  My interim solution is to add the failed page to Pocket (the add-on is flawless) and if I really want to add it to Evernote I\\'ll clip it from my computer\\'s browser in the future when I check it out in Pocket.  I really hope this ad-on sees some development to fix this serious usability issue.",
