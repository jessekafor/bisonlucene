Now you have the opportunity to have greater focus, enhanced concentration, and increased comprehension and retention. Brought to you by internationally recognized Brainwave Audio Entrainment specialist, Leigh Spusta, you can now get the most out of your studying and get the most out of your brain-power!Balance  and  harmonize  the  two  halves  of  the  brain  into  the  ideal  alpha  state  for  focus,  learning,  and  study...  By  targeting  a  mid-alpha  brainwave  frequency,  the  listener  can  get  into  the  perfect  \"zone\"  for  calm,  sharp  focus.
