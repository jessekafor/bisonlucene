    "description": "You can monitor natural disasters around the world, as published by the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System - www.gdacs.org. The app shows the latest natural disasters like earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tropical cyclones, tsunamis and floods as color coded icons in a list as well as on a Google Maps backdrop; the icon colors indicate the alert level - green, orange, and red. The icon will look more transparent the older the event was published. The list view  can be used to sort the natural disaster events according to the datetime, region, and disaster type. Clicking on the item will bring up more details about the disaster event.",
