That way I could play here and therr when I have a free 10-15 minutes. Otherwise I never really get through a full game to unlock more stages. And even if there was a counter to see thr number of cards opponents had would be nice. Because if they had one or two, that would change my mind on picking up the whole discard pile for a few plays. But awesome!!!!!!",

        "comment": "First of all, the interface sucks.  It is difficult to choose the correct card pick up point out of the discarded pile. If it guesses wrong, you\\'re stuck. There is an undo option, but you have to pay for it. Every little option, such as higher levels, different scoring methods, no ads are each considered add-ons.  There are several add-on options ranging from $2-$5 each. If you want to unlock all of them, they offer a package deal for $15.  I\\'ve played a lot of card games and can tell you this: not worth it",
