    "description": "Stock Messaging App with Google Voice capabilities.Big Thanks to the All About Android Podcast for featuring us!http://twit.tv/show/all-about-android/101## WHY YOU WILL LOVE THIS APPâ¢ Single app to manage your text messages (Google Voice and Carrier)â¢ Sends Google Voice messages over DATA/WiFiâ¢ Google Voice & Carrier message POPUP Notifications with QUICK REPLYâ¢ Great Google Voice alternative that actually worksâ¢ Uses your stock messaging database for easy backup (See SMS Backup app)## WHAT IS THIS?We have rebuilt the stock messaging application and added Google Voice capabilities into it. It supports sending and receiving Google Voice texts within the messaging application. It uses DATA/WIFI to receive and send Google Voice texts, therefore, you don't get charged by your carrier. (Note: You will still be charged if you send a text via your carrier. The only time you won't be charged is WHEN YOU SEND/RECEIVE A TEXT VIA GOOGLE VOICE. As long as you see the message \"SENDING VIA GOOGLE VOICE\" on your phone, you won't be charged, as the app uses your DATA/WIFI plan. This app will also show the REAL SENDER NUMBER instead of a random number when you receive a text on your Google Voice account.## BENEFITS TO YOUDo you use Google Voice as well as your phone carrier? Do you have a Google Voice number, and a carrier number? Do you constantly have to switch to Google Voice app for GV texts, and the Stock Messaging App for the carrier text? Download our Messaging + Google Voice App to have a unified interface for both GV and carrier messages.Are you using a tablet/phone without a phone/text plan? This application will allow you to text from your tablet, using the stock messaging interface, with your Google Voice account!The Google Voice app still needs to be installed on your phone, The benefit to you is, now you can send and receive your text messages in a single app, whether Google Voice or Carrier messages.## INSTRUCTIONS:Make sure the Google Voice App is installed on your device.Make sure to turn OFF Google Voice message forwarding. This app will grab the GV incoming texts. If you are receiving Google Voice text from a random number, then you are still being charged by your carrier.Upon installing the M+GV app, go to Settings, and find the Google Voice section. Enable Google Voice. If you are getting double notifications, please read the help section. or visit:http://stockmessagingwithgooglevoice.blogspot.com/2013/01/android-stock-messaging-application.htmlFor any questions, bug reports, please write us at dreambigandroidhelp@gmail.com## IMPORTANT NOTEThis is the TRIAL of our app (200 messages) that will ask you to upgrade to the PRO version after it expires!** The cost of the PRO version is $4.99 and can be purchased within the app **Please consider upgrading to the PRO version and support us! Your support will help us improve the application, and make it the best one on the market. Thank you!If you upgrade to PRO version and decide to uninstall the app, next time you install, it will automatically become PRO. Given that you are using the same Gmail address, you only need to purchase this app once for all of your devices. For more information, please check out our help pages!## UPCOMING FEATURESThemes, SMS Sync, Facebook Messenger Integration, Twitter DMOur goal is to make this the single app that *optionally* integrates your messages:Google Voice, Facebook, Twitter, and of course, your Carrier Messages.## CAN'T WAIT FOR DARK THEME?Feel free to request a beta version from DreamBigAndroidHelp@gmail.comWe will email you instructions.## SIMILAR APPSHandcent, SMS Popup, GoSMS, ChompSMS, NotifierPro## KEYWORDSGV SMS, Google Voice SMS, SMS Notifications, Stock MMS with Google Voice, Google Voice Messaging",

After a few months, the developer of this app released a fix (a long wait if you ask me).  I finally updated to the latest iteration of GV, and it broke this app again.  I uninstalled both, reconfigured settings for each, and it still wouldn\\'t work.  The devs solution is to completely disable GV notification in Settings.  This is not a real fix, because if you use GV for voicemail, you\\'ll never get a notification for your voicemails.  Not acceptable.  4-5 star app if it works.  1 star for now.  And, developer is slow to respond or patch app.",
