    "description": "This is an quiz app to help you study the state capitals.My daughter is currently learning all the state capitals in school and wanted an app to help her study.After trying a number of the apps already in the play store she was not finding what she wanted.They are learning the capitals in small groups, not all 50 at once and she wanted to be able to select a subset of all the states to quiz herself on.  So I created this app.Features:- All 50 US states and their capitals- Ability to select any state(s) you want to be quizzed on- Questions asking what the capitals of states are- Questions asking what state a city is the capital of- Continuous random quiz, stop whenever you are done- Keeps score as you go and maintains a grade for your quiz- Study screen where you can review your selected statesI published the app to the play store in case there are others out there with a similar need.  Enjoy and please send me an e-mail with any issues / suggestions you may have.",
