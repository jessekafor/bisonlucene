    "description": "DrawExpress is a fast gesture-recognition diagram application.  With DrawExpress, you can draw diagrams and flowcharts in a simple and intuitive way. It's just as easy as using a pen and paper! Whether you work in software design, finance, business, law, or need it for school, DrawExpress is the ultimate solution to your diagramming needs. Try out the free DrawExpress Lite version before your purchase to see if DrawExpress is right for you! Visit www.drawexpress.com for more details.What can you can draw with DrawExpress?Software UML and Network Designs:- Use case Diagram- Sequence Diagram- Class Diagram- State Diagram- ER Diagram- Data Flow Diagram- Network DiagramBusiness Processes and Mind Maps:- Flowchart- Organization Chart- Process Flow- Mind map- Feature List- Decision Tree- Visual NotesNOTE: DrawExpress can be exported to PNG, SVG, and DE (DrawExpress) format and share with Dropbox and Email.NOTE: DrawExpress LITE Version has a limit of 5 diagrams.Here are some helpful starting tips:-          To span the surface of your device, use two fingers and maintain the spacing between them. It is easiest to use the thumb and index finger.-          When selecting a shape or group of shapes for deletion, you can do so by drawing \"x\".-          When selecting a shape or group of shapes for copying, you can do so by drawing \"x\".-          If you inadvertently draw unwanted lines or unrecognized shapes in red strokes, do NOT use the undo button. Simply touching the screen with two fingers will clear these lines. Also, if you ignore the lines and continue to draw over them with a successful shape or action, the unwanted lines will automatically disappear. -          When drawing connectors, try to start in the middle of the first shape and end your connector stroke within the middle of the second shape. Any point within the shape is fine.-          You can select a boundary box by touching its border only.  You can double tap on the border of a shape for labelling.It's easier than it sounds and actions speak louder than words. Watch our tutorial video on www.drawexpress.com to see how easy it is to use our diagramming tool.Also check out the tutorial slides on our website www.drawexpress.com.",

        "comment": "Usually this type of apps are a pain to use due to big menus with several clicks to select a shape or property. This app has solved this problem with gestures (Tried most of them, only have problems with arrows): you want a circle, draw a circle, you want a connector, simply connect both shapes with a line from center to center.  It only lacks (maybe it exists but  I haven\\'t found it) possibility to change background design. Another thing I don\\'t like is its appearance and icons which could be more professional and appealing.  Great app!",
