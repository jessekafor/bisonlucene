        "comment": "I have bought the software to support the developer, but lately I don\\'t seen any improvements made to the program. Your rival software has moved on, Using Google Chrome now I can move an entire folder to my mob using their software. I expect you to add that feature as soon as possible, One star less for that, and hope u will improve the browser interface too... Otherwise I am extremely happy with the purchase.",
