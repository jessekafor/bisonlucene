    "description": "The Opening of the 3rd Eye Awaken your psychic intuition and experience heightened awareness through guided imagery, hypnosis, and powerful soundscapes...Prepare yourself to embark on a new journey in your life, opening up to heightened awareness, greater intuition, and the development of your psychic abilities. Brought to you by internationally recognized brainwave entrainment audio expert Leigh Spusta, you will be guided into the expansion of consciousness and the opening and activation of the 3rd eye center, through hypnotic language patterns, guided imagery, and trance-inducing sound that is specifically designed to create deep relaxation while resonating to activate the 3rd eye center. This powerful 30 minute program can be used when you seek insight, but is most potent when used regularly, developing your psychic intuition steadily over time... The third eye (also known as the inner eye) is a mystical and esoteric concept referring in part to the ajna (brow) chakra in certain spiritual traditions. It is also spoken of as the gate that leads within to inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness. In New Age spirituality, the third eye may alternately symbolize a state of enlightenment or the evocation of mental images having deeply personal spiritual or psychological significance. The third eye is often associated with visions, clairvoyance (which includes the ability to observe chakras and auras), precognition, and out-of-body experiences. People who have developed the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as seers. This 30 minute recording will bring you into an altered state of expanded consciousness, so you are advised to not listen while driving. This app streams using 3G or wifi connection. This recording has been produced utilizing the proprietary PsimatiXÂª audio entrainment methods to create powerful results. Also check out the \"Psychic Intuition Deluxe Set\" for added content.Leigh Spusta is a behavioral scientist, hypnotherapist, and Certified Therapeutic Imagery Facilitator specializing in the use of sound frequencies to produce deep, relaxing trance states. He has worked with several therapists in Los Angeles, producing a variety of therapeutic audio cds. Leigh combines his talents as a musician and his knowledge of hypnosis and related states, in an effort to pioneer new approaches in creating rich, resonant sound-scapes for greater efficacy in healing and meditative products. Leigh is the developer of the proprietary PsimatiXÂª therapeutic approaches and technologies.
