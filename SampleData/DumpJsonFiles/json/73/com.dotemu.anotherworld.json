If you want a great puzzle solving game to bide your time for hours pick this one up, but if you want to see this gane the way it was meant to be seen pick up a sega cd emulator.",

Unfortunately, as is so often the case with touch screen ports, this game is let down by the controls.  I was able to make NO progress using the on-screen controls. I bought a ZeeMote and found that the ZeeMote\\'s analog stick just isn\\'t the right thing for a game designed for a 4-way joystick (I\\'m unable to consistently run using the ZeeMote).   I suspect it might be OK with the MOGA pro controller (if you can use the d-pad instead of the analog sticks). Alternately, if you can get a WiiMote or other game pad to function, and map correctly, that would probably do just fine as well.",
