    "description": "These paintings were by American artist, Edwin Lord Weeks, who was born 1849 and died in 1903. These were painted between 1880 and 1890. I love the classical style, the colors and the narrative qualities of the imagery.Features:â· Save images as wallpaper â· Share with friends via Facebook, Twitter, SMS, email and moreâ· Contains 56 colorful wallpapersAll images copyright their respective owners.Tags:  20th, landscapes, figurative, theme, dream, dreamtreeLegal notice: We believe our images fall under the fair use doctrine/public domain, as they are reduced size and excerpted for informational purposes.
