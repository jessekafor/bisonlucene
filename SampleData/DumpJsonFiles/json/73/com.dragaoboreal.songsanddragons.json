    "description": "Songs & Dragons make it easy to introduce music on your games by using the portability of a phone or a tablet and the convenience of a touch screen. Create scenes and events and activate and deactivate them with a single touch. Say goodbye to bringing a cumbersome laptop to your game table when all you need is at the touch of a finger.WARNING: This app DOES NOT come with preloaded audio or image files. It is a tool to organize and use YOUR collection, the donation version comes with a link to download some files to help get you started. More info bellow.Some advanced features include: - Copying events between scenes; - Doing a backup from your scenes and events, so you can change your ROM or device without the fear of losing all your work; - Multi-selection of audio files, with the ability to preview them while searching; - Looping events with random wait times between them, to create a very natural feeling; - The Stage, allowing you to play up to five scenes at once; - Global events, common to all scenes; - Background playing, so you can check that PDF without fear of the app being killed by the android system; - UI that feels and looks Android; - Rich notifications (only supported on 3.0+); - Tablet and ICS-optimized.A small guide on how to use the app with screenshots, can be seen here: http://bit.ly/18RFDw9Songs & Dragons does not contain any sounds, images or any kind of database. It is merely a tool to help you organize your own library and easily use it during gameplay.This app will be free and ad-free forever! But if you want, you can get the donate version which, apart from making the developer a little bit closer to his plan of world domination, comes with a link for downloading a .zip file containing copyright-free images and audio. More details on its own page.Permissions: - Write to SD card: to save the backup file. - Internet: used for bug reporting.

Part of tabletop is putting the effort in to create ambiance, not using canned sounds over and over. Be creative! Go forth into the interwebs and discover your own unique sound combos instead of just complaining that someone hasn\\'t bundled it up and given it to you already.",
