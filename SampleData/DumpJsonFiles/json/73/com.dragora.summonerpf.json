        "comment": "I tried it and liked it a lot for what it was. The downside is this is billed as being useful for a \\\"d20 based RPG\\\". The problem is that I was not able to figure out how to change or customize the list. I understand why it may be incomplete based on potential OGL restrictions, but not being able to fix the deficiency by customizing is not useful. For instance the lists do not have Giant Eagle available under Summon Nature Ally III nor Hippogriff as Level II, etc. I may retry again after updates.",
