    "description": "GanttMan is a tool for project scheduling and management. It allows you to create new or edit existing project wherever you are.GanttMan is compatible with desktop tool Gantt Project (http://www.ganttproject.biz). We are working to support more formats.Don't know what it is good for? Primary it is used for leading team projects. However, you can use it for planning whatever you want! The idea is to divide project into tasks with time interval. You can also specify that one task can start after the other one has finished. Then you can simply control if you are on time or not. If there are more people working on the project, you can assign people to tasks.Do you want to know news, plans and discuss with others? Like page on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/ganttman).** I'm going to work on new features and you can decide which features will be available in future. Just send us email with your ideas and requirements: contact@ganttman.com.Please be patient. We are working to fix all bugs.If application is stopped, please send report. Thank you for helping us! **Features:- Gantt chart view with dependencies and resource assignments- Resource chart view- Moving with existing tasks- Sorting by date- File association (only local files for now) and sharing saved projects (email, Dropbox, Google Drive)- Build-in file manager for opening projects from SD card and internal storage- Changes are saved automatically to work faster - you don't have to click OK button to save changes (whole project is not automatically saved!)- Add tasks to calendar- Dependence loop detector- NO AD BANNERPlease report your ideas and bugs by email.Tags: Gantt chart, resourse assignment, dependency, gantt, project management tool, task, planning, schedule",

        "comment": "Simply does 99% of what anyone does with gantt charts. Saving so that it can be edited with a Open source program (GanttProject) and the ability to save it to various clouds like Dropbox is very smart. I\\'m very happy with what it does now and am looking forward to your future improvements.  I do have one issue. I created a project, saved it to Dropbox, then opened it with GanttProject. The Resource gantt chart is there, but I can\\'t see the resource names on the left. To be fair, the only resource information I filled out was first names, then assigned them to some of the steps. They show up fine on my phone in GanttMan.   Thanks again for an obviously well-thought out product.",
