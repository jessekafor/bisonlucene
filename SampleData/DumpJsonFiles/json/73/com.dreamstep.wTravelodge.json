It keeps launching browser to display ads, I suspect it is meant to display ads in app but someone didn\\'t debug and instead it opens browser...constantly...almost rendering the app unuseable!  Gave up and launched browser to use the website rather than this.  Too many firms release an app because they can rather than making sure it is fit for purpose and can be used by the customer to the benefit of both parties.  This app needs a hell of a lot of work.",

When I eventually arrived at what appeared to have been a booking confirmation screen I could not see what dates I had booked, surely a most basic requisite.  Obviously I did not proceed on that basis.  Have the software designers ever booked accommodation online before?  One has to wonder!  Keep It Simple, Silly!  (KISS)",

A much bigger problem is Travelodge\\'s business practice of double booking rooms and taking the money then confronting the unlucky customer with the bad news that their confirmation is worthless when they arrive. There are many forums highlighting this shoddy business practice.  Avoid Travelodge, the rooms are dirty and the attitude to customers stinks!",
