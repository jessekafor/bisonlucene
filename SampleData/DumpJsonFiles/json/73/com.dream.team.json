Player ratings are a bit random and prices seem a little lose, but outweighted by all the great features. The only real important would be if the people rating the players actually watched the game, rather than randomly allocating numbers to players they know. adds a new dimension to the champs. \\'Sun produces something that isnt rubbish shock!\\' Thanks sun!",
