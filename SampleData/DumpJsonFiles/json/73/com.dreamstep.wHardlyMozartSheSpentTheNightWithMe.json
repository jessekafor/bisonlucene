    "description": "A Promotional video from Hardly Mozart of a song from their album \"Whatever Happened To Jago\"Live at the Dublin Castle CamdenFrom The Album \"Whatever Happened to Jago\"Red Admiral Records- REDAD CDA549 Originally formed as JAGO a five-piece in 2003 and named the band as a result of an infatuation with TV weathergirl, Becky Jago (who attended gigs and posed for photos with the band). Jago had been labelled the best unsigned band in the country! But needed a unique name so Hardly Mozart it was then. Unfortunately the Band split soon after their album was released due to personal differences. Or was it a girl??Video and soundtrackCopyright Red Admiral Records LLPPublished by Cringe Music mcps/prs London",
