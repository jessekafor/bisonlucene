        "comment": "...the port is far from being excellent. It runs smooth and technically good but there are some little things that keep me from rate this game to five. First, if enabled, touch controls on the screen annoyingly blinking. Second, suprisingly there is no landscape mode, only portrait. And finally, no subtitles, so if you want to play it in some crowded place, you must grab headphones in order to understand what\\'s going on in the game.",

The first person aspect is very immersive and the atmosphere is very cleverly done. There is a subtle hint system if your lost. Its also a lengthy game as far as I understand, 20 plus hours. Unfortunately character animations are hit and miss, some characters sort of move picture book style and others fluid as you interact with them. Be patient with it.",

        "comment": "One of the greatest adventure games on PC is finally on Android, and you should just pick it up if you\\'re a fan of a great plot and adventure. The initial price is quite low as well. Seriously, now Telltale has no reason to keep Walking Dead off Android, they need to follow DotEmu and Revolution Games (creators of Broken Sword).  Buy this now!",
