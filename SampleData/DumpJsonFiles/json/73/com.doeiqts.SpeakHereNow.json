    "description": "IMPORTANT: Chrome for Android has a bug in the latest build that doesn't redirect back to Speak Here Now after you sign in to Remember The Milk. Until this is fixed, you can get signed in by using a different browser (Opera, Dolphin, etc) to authorize RTM the first time you use it. After this, you shouldn't need to use the browser for anything else.NOTE: Please don't confuse this with Google's Voice Search. If you're clicking the mic next to the Google Search bar then you're not using this app.Speak Here Now is an Android application that allows you to simply speak what you want to do, rather than having to type it out on that tiny mobile keyboard. Just hold the physical Search button (if your device has one) or open the application and say what you want to do.Built-in Commands:\"TWEET\" + [what you're tweeting]: sends a tweet through Twitter\"REMEMBER\" + [task to remember]: adds that task to your Remember The Milk\"LISTEN TO\" + [song or artist]: same as Google's Voice Search\"SETTINGS\" + \"Turn Google Plus on\": Open Google+ after you tweet\"SETTINGS\" + \"Turn Google Plus off\": Don't open Google+ after you tweet\"SETTINGS\" + \"Set default action to\" + [COMMAND]: always use this command, so you don't have to say it anymore\"SETTINGS\" + \"Clear default action\": Clears the default actionSince you don't want a tweet going out that wasn't what you really said, Speak Here Now will read the tweet back to you to make sure it heard you correctly and ask if it understood you. Just say yes and off your tweet goes to all your followers. If it misunderstood you just say no and try again. Never have to worry about a messed up tweet getting sent again.Remember The Milk tasks are not confirmed, but only you will see it if there's a mistake. ;)Other applications can now use Speak Here Now to make their apps voice enabled as well, so check with your favorite developers to see if you can use their apps with Speak Here Now!This is tested with English only. May work with other languages that Google supports.This application and it's creator are not affiliated with Twitter or Google or Remember The Milk in any way shape or form. Yet.",

        "comment": "This does just what it promises -- lets you dictate a task that goes instantly into Remember the Milk.  I installed it on my Galaxy S4. You can just say \\\"Remember\\\" followed by the task, and you get a quick confirmation flashing on the screen to show you what\\'s being entered in RTM. You can also, as I learned from the very helpful developer -- he replied to me right away when I queried him -- set the default so that you don\\'t even have to say \\\"Remember\\\" -- you can just start by saying the task.   To do this, I first said \\\"Settings clear default action\\\" and then, after a confirmation flashed, I said, \\\"Settings Set Default Command to Remember.\\\"  Bravo for the app!",

I have been looking for something like this that is quick and easy for when I am driving - one quick touch of an icon and my note is waiting in the RTM inbox. I\\'ve set up the default command to RTM so I don\\'t even have to remember to say remember. As mentioned it isn\\'t to clear how to get setup to use RTM, read the RTM screen when it pops up. Once it is set up RTM will not be opened again as you add notes. I have only played with other features and they seem to work fine also.",
