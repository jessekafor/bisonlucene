    "description": "For those unfamiliar with the concept of a Drive Away Service, it is a vehicle delivery service.  We pick up your vehicle at one location and deliver it to another.  This is a convenient way for those that live in northern states and spend their winter at a vacation home in Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, to have their personal vehicle without the headache or hassle of driving.But snowbirds are not the only group that could benefit from a Drive Away Service.  If you are a professional and are relocating to a neighboring state or across country, this is a great way to get your vehicle there in a timely manner and leaving you to get a jump on settling in to your new home and position.",
