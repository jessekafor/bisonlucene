    "description": "Just look at the spinning girl, if she is spinning clockwise, you are more partial to right brain functioning. Whereas if she is spinning counterclockwise, your a left brain operator.Left  Brain CharacteristicsLeft brained people are characterized by sequential, logical and analytical. They can easily see the path from a to b.  Left brainers also communicate directly, via speech or writing and respond very well to verbal directions. They also can focus very easily and pay attention to details.As learners, left brains tend to understand through lectures, discussion and rationalization. Typcial left brain professions are accountants, lawyers and careers in the area of science.Right Brain CharacteristicsRight brained people are very creative and intuitive. They spend alot of time imagining and dreaming, which helps them create many ideas. Right brainers tend to follow their intuition and be very spontaneous.People strong in right brain activity tend to shine in careers as artists, entrepreneurs, craftsmen and sales. Right brained people tend to understand new information by stories, diagrams, allegories and metaphors. When communicating, right brained people tend to communicate indirectly by gestures, voice tone. As in its not what they say, but HOW they say it.Switch HittersWhile there is a good chance you already knew which way you tend to lean, creative or analytical. But here's the real question - can you change the way you see the girl spin? On command?In baseball, some of the most valuable players are \"Switch Hitters\", as in they can hit the ball with their right hand or left hand, depending on the pitcher or where they need to hit the ball.If you are one of the lucky few who knows how to control which hemisphere of the brain to use for specific tasks, consider yourself a switch hitter. People with this skill know that when they need to focus and rationalize, they need to operate from their left brain space, then can switch into a creative state of mind when needed.",
