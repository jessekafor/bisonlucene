        "comment": "1 Where in the Bible is the sinner\\'s prayer? I can\\'t find it or even see it\\'s necessity. 2 How does the prayer save us? I thought that we were saved by faith and that nothing that we do can save us, so how is it that because we pray we get saved? 3 Why only Romans? All scripture is inspired by God (2 Tim. 3:16). Why should we follow what Paul says over Christ\\'s sayings in the Gospels? 4 Is there any historical data?  In short, the app is unsatisfactory; it\\'s incomplete and incompatible for Christianity.",
