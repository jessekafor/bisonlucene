The puzzle designs include animals, letters, shapes, a child's birthday party, ocean and farm scenes,fruits and vegetables, musical instruments, Easter, Christmas,transportation, playground, toys and many more.The puzzle works very easily, a piece of the puzzle appears in a box in the upper right corner and needs to be inserted in one of the shadows in the picture.The child drags it to where he thinks it belongs. If he is wrong, he get to try again. Every puzzle piece he places triggers a silly sound effect, cheer, animal sounds and more. Once the puzzle is solved your child can play around with the sound effects by tapping on the figures. An exit button on the bottom left brings you back to the selection menu.After a brief tutorial session with your toddler, the app will be simple enough for him to operate alone.The puzzles range in difficulty. Easier ones feature a few big shapes or letters, while more complex ones require dozens of pieces, some of them quite small. The puzzle pieces are perfectly suited for a childâs tiny fingers.
