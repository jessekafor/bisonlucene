        "comment": "I love this series, but this one in particular is lacking. There are no goals to follow, nothing to look forward to. My favorite thing about the other games was the celebrity day every 30 days, it left me excited and kept me playing. I\\'ve leveled up all my stores completely in just a few days (as far as you can without paying real money) and grown very bores because there\\'s nothing else to do.",
