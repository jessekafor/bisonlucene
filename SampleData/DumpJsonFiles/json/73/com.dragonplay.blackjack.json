        "comment": "This game is pretty fun but as you play for more than 30mins you can easily see that it\\'s rigged. The cards aren\\'t generated randomly. Anytime I get a Queen and a 2, 90% of the time the next card is a king or queen.  I\\'m quite good at this game from being in real casinos but the win ratio isn\\'t realistic. The dealer wins about 70% of the time by usually getting black jacks or by one more card even if you\\'re on 19/20. Fun in small amounts.",
