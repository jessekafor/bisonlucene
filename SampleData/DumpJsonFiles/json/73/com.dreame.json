        "title": "Fun bit of pseudo-psychology",
        "comment": "This is fun to play with but don\\'t take it seriously. It has some flaws which point out the risks of trying to automate a psychotherapy process. For instance, I was testing it with various dreams from real counseling situations and it just told me that I should \\\"cultivate the quality of \\'suicide\\' whenever I need to deal with \\'confidence\\'\\\". A human would never make that kind of error in understanding.  Still, better than a dream dictionary. At least the makers understand that dreams are only what *you* make of them not what Jung or some blissed-out new ager thinks they mean.",
