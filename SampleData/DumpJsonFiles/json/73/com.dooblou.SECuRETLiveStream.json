Once installed it worked - for a while - then started to jitter. Restart, cured, but that\\'s not the point, I want continuous monitoring, not intermittent, in fairness, it could be a battery problem with the device. The app is fine, but don\\'t expect bells and whistles. Basic, yes, but it doesn\\'t do what I want it to do. The BabyCam Monitor might be better, but for monitoring an adult with dementia, the interface sucks.  It works, but don\\'t expect miracles.  Also have serious issues with the use of Java.",
