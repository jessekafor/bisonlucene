    "description": "The idea behind Just Dharma Quotes is to give you a collection of hopefully inspiring dharma quotes in the palm of your hands. Among other features this app allows you to find quotes through full text search, lists quotes sorted by authors, includes a basic favorite quotes functionality and makes it easy to share the gems you discover with your friends on facebook and alike. Once installed this app wonât need internet access except for downloading new quotes if available.The collection of quotes is based on the just dharma quotes blog from which we occasionally will make new quotes available for direct download from within the app. http://justdharmaquotes.wordpress.com/Remarks:Facebook doesn't allow to pre-fill the facebook textfield when sharing content. For that reason our app copies the quote content (title, author etc as specified in the settings)  to the clipboard and you can paste it into the facebook textfield by touch & hold the textfield once it appears.",
