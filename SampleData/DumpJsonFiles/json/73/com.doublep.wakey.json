        "comment": "All my husband and I ever wanted was to have the screen display stay on during a call placed on speaker phone and try to use the keypad without it going dark and then having to hit the on button a dozen times to keep the display on.  None of the factory settings we changed would help.  We both have Samsung Galaxy 2.  This app did just what we wanted.  Turn on or sign into your phone, hit the light bulb icon and the screen display stays on.  Hit light bulb icon again and shut off Wakey or leave alone and manually shut screen off and keep Wakey on for future use.  This app just made life a little less frustrating.",
