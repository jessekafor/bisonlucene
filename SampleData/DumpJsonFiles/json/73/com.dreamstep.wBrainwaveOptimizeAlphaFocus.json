Now  you  have  the  opportunity  to  have  greater  focus,  enhanced  concentration,  and  increased  comprehension  and  retention.  Brought  to  you  by  internationally  recognized  Brainwave  Audio  Entrainment  specialist,  Leigh  Spusta,  you  can  now  get  the  most  out  of  your  studying  and  get  the  most  out  of  your  brain-power! Balance    and    harmonize    the    two    halves    of    the    brain    into    the    ideal    alpha    state    for    focus,    learning,    and    study...    By    targeting    a    mid-alpha    brainwave    frequency,    the    listener    can    get    into    the    perfect    \"zone\"    for    calm,    sharp    focus.    By    also    producing    a    hemispheric    syncronization    effect,    the    two    halves    of    the    brain    begin    what    is    called    \"bilateral    processing\"    where    the    two    hemispheres    of    the    brain    sync    and    bridge    across    the    corpus    collosum,    sharing    data    in    a    \"whole-brain\"    manner    that    enhances    learning,    retention,    recall,    and    comprehension.
