    "description": "Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same ancestral lines, sometimes by mixing dogs from very different lines. The process continues today, resulting in a wide variety of breeds, hybrids, and types of dog. Centuries of selective breeding by humans has resulted in dogs being considerable more genetically diverse then most other mammals, and as such dogs are the only animal with such a wide variation in appearance without speciation, \"from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane\".Breeds are usually categorized by the functional type from which the breed was developed. The basic types are companion dogs, guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, and working dogs, although there are many other types and subtypes. Breeds listed here may be traditional breeds with long histories as registered breeds, rare breeds with their own registries, or new breeds that may still be under development.Tags: dog, dogs, breed, breeds, collection.",

        "comment": "I am researching what kind of dog to get, and I really like how this app allows you to scroll through an image grid of all the dog breeds. However, this app would be way more useful if you could filter the breeds by size and other factors (other than name). The breed descriptions are missing lots of valuable data. Also, many of the descriptions start with something like ....this is a dog breed... That statement is redundant, and needs to be removed.",
