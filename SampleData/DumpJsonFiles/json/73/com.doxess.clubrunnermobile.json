        "comment": "First, the good. Nice directory with club\\'s members, including pictures and contact information. The phone and e-mail links are active, allowing direct dialing or e-mail of an individual member. Very handy on the run. The meeting locator function is nice, too.   Now for areas of improvement.The screen does not autorotate for landscape mode. On my phone (Droid Bionic) this is simply annoying. On my tablet (ASUS TF300T) it is problematic as it renders my keyboard useless in using the app. Autorotate is such a basic feature going back to the earliest days of smart phones that it is a huge oversight to not be included. Also, the member list is not working on my tablet.  The app requires one to log back in each time the app exits and restarts. This is a pain. Remember at least my username, but having an option to remember everything would be nice.   The story links don\\'t work. The links within the story are not active.Even just jumping to an external browser would be helpful.   Beyond the obvious basic improvements, it would be nice to have more functionality with the app. A nice feature would be the ability to send group e-mails to club members through the app.",
