Doesn\\'t matter if I have a strong wifi or 3G connection, the game will not load 9 out of 10 times. The last straw was when the game FINALLY loaded and all seven of my characters were deleted. Very frustrating especially after getting to level 48 and over 5 million coins. Game will be uninstalled.",
