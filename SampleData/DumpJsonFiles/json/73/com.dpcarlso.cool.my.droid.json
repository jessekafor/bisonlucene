    "description": "Cool your device down with Cool My Droid!This is one of the first apps that cools your phone on the Android Market. Cool My Droid helps your device get back down to a safe operating temperature, skipping the hassle of having to restart it. Just hit the \"off\" button to start. Works for tablets too!If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email the developer.This app does not include a widget due to the fact that this could potentially increase the device's temperature. That would defeat the purpose of the app.Caution: In an attempt to cool your device faster, some antennas on your device will be turned off.Like us on Facebook!https://www.facebook.com/CoolDownPhoneThanks to:http://iconbug.com/detail/icon/346/super-cold/",
