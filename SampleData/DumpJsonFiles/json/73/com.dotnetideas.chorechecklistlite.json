    "description": "Chore Checklist helps you to manage chores at home or other places. It records chores' completion date and calculate next due date based on your preference. You can also set reminder for each chore.It comes with a pre-loaded check list which has routines, such as \"Daily Routine\", \"Weekly Routine\", \"Monthly Routine\" and etc. You may edit them or add new routine/chores.Since version 2.0, users are allowed to create multiple lists. In full version, user can use widget view as a dashboard to combine multiple lists in one view. There are also statistics reports to record chore completion history. With separate purchase of Chore Checklist Cloud Connector, the full version users can also sync/backup to cloud and share their lists with other users. We also provide free online editor at www.dotnetideas.com for easy list editing.***It will not be efficient if you only leave comment in Google Play when you have issues using this app. The best way to solve them is to contact us directly.

        "comment": "I absolutely love this app. It was exactly what I have been looking for.  I love that you can set it to show your next due date for a task based on the completion date.  The ONLY reason that I didn\\'t give this five stars is because I wish there was an option to sort tasks by room.  You can drag them around and put them in the order you want them it, but I think it would be awesome if you could just click \\\"show living room tasks\\\" and then you could tackle the lists room by room.  Other than that, excellent job!",
