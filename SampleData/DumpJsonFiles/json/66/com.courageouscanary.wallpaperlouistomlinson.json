They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after being formed and finishing third in the seventh series of British television singing competition The X Factor in 2010.The group subsequently signed in the United States with Columbia Records. Becoming a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, their two albums Up All Night (2011) and Take Me Home, broke several records, topped the charts of most major markets, and generated worldwide chart-topping singles, including the song \"What Makes You Beautiful\"..One Direction are often described as sparking the resurgence in the boy band concept, and of forming part of a new \"British Invasion\" in the United States. Their achievements include a BRIT Award and 3 MTV Video Music Awards. As of November 2012, the boy band have sold over 15 million records worldwide. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012.  They were proclaimed 2012's 'Top New Artist' by Billboard, while The Huffington Post named 2012 \"The Year of One Direction\".Louis William Tomlinson, born Louis Troy Austin on 24 December 1991 (age 21), is from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Born to mother Johannah Poulston and father Troy Austin, his parents split when he was young and he took on his stepfather Mark Tomlinson's name. He has five younger half-sisters, and two of them had roles as babies on television series Fat Friends, on which he would go along and serve as an extra. After Fat Friends, he attended an acting school in Barnsley. He had small parts in an ITV1 drama film If I Had You and BBC's Waterloo Road. He was a sixth form student at Hall Cross School, a state comprehensive school, and a former pupil of the Hayfield School. He revealed that he failed his first year of A levels at the Hayfield School and ended up going back to Hall Cross and started A levels over again. He had a number of jobs, including at a Vue cinema and at Doncaster Rovers football stadium as a waiter in their hospitality suites.As a student at Hall Cross, Tomlinson starred in several musical productions. Tomlinson revealed that landing the lead role of Danny Zuko in the Hall Cross musical production of Grease motivated him to audition for The X Factor. Tomlinson cites Robbie Williams as his biggest influence and idol. In an interview with Now Magazine, he stated: \"I've always loved [Robbie]. He's just so cheeky, he can get away with anything. His performances are unbelievable.\" He also admires recording artist Ed Sheeran, describing him as \"phenomenal.\"One Direction have been recipients of a BRIT Awardâwinning their first with \"What Makes You Beautiful\" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards, a NME Award, two Kids' Choice Awards, and three MTV Video Music Awards, among other awards. One Direction won all three awards, they were nominated for at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards",
