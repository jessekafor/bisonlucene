He had a financially secure upbringing that allowed him to focus on both school and football at the same time. His younger brother Rodrigo (best known as DigÃ£o) and cousin Eduardo Delani are also professional footballers.When he was seven, KakÃ¡'s family moved to SÃ£o Paulo. His school had arranged him in a local youth club called \"Alphaville,\" who qualified to the final in a local tournament. There he was discovered by hometown club SÃ£o Paulo FC, who offered an assignment. At the age of 18, KakÃ¡ suffered a career-threatening and possibly paralysis-inducing spinal fracture as a result of a swimming pool accident, but remarkably made a full recovery. He attributes his recovery to God and has since tithed his income to his church.On 3 June 2009, Football Italia reported that newly-elected Real Madrid president Florentino PÃ©rez had offered Milan a â¬68.5 million deal for KakÃ¡, two days after the player had left for international duty with Brazil. Milan vice president Adriano Galliani did not deny the reports, and confirmed that he and KakÃ¡'s father, Bosco Leite, had traveled to Mexico to meet with La Volpe. \"We had lunch and spoke about KakÃ¡. I don't deny it. Negotiations exist, but a deal has yet to be done.\" On 4 June, Galliani told Gazzetta dello Sport that financial reasons were his motive for the talks with La Volpe. \"We cannot allow [Milan] to lose â¬70 million. The reasons behind KakÃ¡'s departure would be economic.\" On 8 June, Milan and Real Madrid confirmed KakÃ¡ has moved to the BernabÃ©u on a six-year deal.KakÃ¡ made his unofficial debut on 7 August 2009, in a 5â1 friendly victory against Toronto FC. He scored his first goal for Madrid during a pre-season match on 19 August 2009, in a 5â0 victory against Borussia Dortmund.[32] KakÃ¡ later made his league debut on 29 August 2009 in a 3â2 win against Deportivo La CoruÃ±a. He scored his first goal, a penalty kick, on 23 September, in a 2â0 against Villarreal. On 5 August 2010, Real Madrid announced that KakÃ¡ had undergone a successful surgery on a long-standing left knee injury and would face up to four months on the sidelines. KakÃ¡ returned to training after a long lay-off and manager Jose Mourinho said that having KakÃ¡ back was like a new signing.After an eight-month absence, KakÃ¡ returned to play by entering as a substitute for Karim Benzema on the 77th minute of a 3â2 victory over Getafe on 3 January 2011. He said he was \" happy for playing a game again and for stepping onto a pitch.\" and glad to be with friends Cristiano Ronaldo and  Ronaldinho.  In March 2011 KakÃ¡ suffered from Iliotibial band syndrome which kept him sidelined for a few weeks. After returning from injury, he appeared in a convincing win over Valencia, scoring two goals. At the end of his second season with the club, Real Madrid and KakÃ¡ had won the Copa del Rey.On 27 September 2011, KakÃ¡ experienced one of his best matches as a Real Madrid player during a 3â0 victory over Ajax in the Champions League beating out Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ and Caroline Celico.",
