You can look up the zip code with the app but that seems silly.  Probably the worst app of this sort I have ever used.  I LOVE Cracker Barrel <3 <3 <3,  Their food and waitstaff are consistently awesome. I wish they would hire a company to develop their app that put that type of passion and attention to detail into developing a Cracker Barrel app.",

Well that is totally useless if I\\'m on the road and I want to know where the nearest CBs are , say , in the state of Georgia.  Having it pop up a map would be a lot more useful.  And yes I have my GPS on.   I think that maybe my Garmin GPS might do a better job.",
