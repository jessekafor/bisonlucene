    "description": "TASA's Midwinter Conferenceâwhich attracts education leadership teams from every region of the stateâis the perfect venue for attendees to continue to expand upon the work that has been taking place since MISSION: School Transformation launched at the 2012 Midwinter Conference. While offering critical sessions addressing the administrative issues that face school leaders every day, the 2013 Midwinter Conference really raises the bar with a host of General, Thought Leader, and Concurrent Session speakers that will challenge all of us to think in ways we never have and provide direction as we steer our districts down new and innovative paths.",
