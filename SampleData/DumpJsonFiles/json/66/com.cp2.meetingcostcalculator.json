The Odometer adds an impressive sense of dollars being spent.As of V1.75 If application is left running on navigate away or exit, when the app is resumed or restarted, the Odometer continues as if not exited, dollars are accrued against the meeting.  If Turned off, the odometer and values are restored, but dollars are NOT accrued against the meeting.  This allows exit, saving battery, but on reopen, is still accurate measure of meeting cost, and allows breaks in the meeting to not accrue against the meeting totalnote: Update, as of September I now own an Android Phone, Sprint Epic Touch 4G.",

Perfect for those meetings where everyone is waiting for someone who\\'s late.  Just what I was looking for!  Thanks!   Suggestions:  Wish full network access wasn\\'t needed. Wonder why # people takes decimal value.",
