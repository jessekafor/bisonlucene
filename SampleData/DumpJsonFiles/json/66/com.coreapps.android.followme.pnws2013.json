Don't miss the great technical sessions, the 100 plus vendor tradeshow and the fantastic networking opportunities. With the huge variety of focus areas including treatment, distribution, conservation, engineering and many others, the PNWS Section Conference is a great way to earn CEUâs and PDHâs. It's also a great place to have a little fun and meet new and interesting members of the northwests water community. There is something for everyone from golf to a 5K Fun Run and Walk. Don't forget the Tapping, Meter Madness, Top Ops and Best Tasting Water competitions. The Northwest's largest water conference has something for everyone, May 8-10, 2013 in Spokane, Washington!",
