    "description": "New Version 1.6!  Keep sending feedback to support@cowboycardsharks.com! Thank you!Welcome to the Old West, where four wisecracking card sharks will try to take your money.  You'll play against Annie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid.  Each player has his own unique style of play - and they'll help you learn how to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em.Annie:Annie is a local that's been hanging around the Saloon and playing poker for as long as she can remember.  If you're not careful, Annie will take your money in a big hurry!  She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.  Cowboy:The Cowboy is a tough guy in for some hard-driving card playing!  He's a tough one to figure out though.  He spends most of his time out on the ranch so people around here don't see him much.  When he does come to town, he likes to play poker.  Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one.  However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.Kid:The Kid is in town looking for a good time.  He just got paid and he thinks he can pull a fast one on the locals.  He's been in the Saloon just a bit too long and has had a bit too much to drink.  He's not a very good poker player and makes mistakes.  The longer he plays, the more chances you'll have to beat him.Gambler:The Gambler is a gruff old man.  Nobody here knows where he came from, but he never seems to leave the Saloon.  He's a \"rock\" and knows the odds of every hand - and he always plays the odds.  He'll bet on a good hand and fold on a weak one.In addition to some interesting characters, there's an awesome, authentic saloon piano soundtrack performed by Squeek Steele!  If you like her music (and you will), go check out http://www.goodoldsongs.com!Learn to Play:You have many options for hints and strategy.  Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold.  The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving.  In the Pro version, you also have the option of seeing your opponentsâ cards during the deal!  Pro Features (not in FREE version): * More games: Crazy Pineapple and Tahoe * See opponent's cards * Displays opponent's best hand * Choose your cards to play in Omaha, Pineapple, and Tahoe Hold'em  * Choose players * Play one-on-one! * More Squeek Steele songs!  * NO annoying interruptions * NO in-app purchases * Every improvement and upgrade is free.NOTE:  We hope you enjoy this game!
