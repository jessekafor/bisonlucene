        "comment": "Successfully registered at the Cortado Workplace website, installed the Thinprint Connector on both my laptop which is connected to my printer via USB, and my Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet. I pull up a webpage (and I\\'ve tried several different ones, to ensure it wasn\\'t the fault of the page), and then from my tablet I \\\"share to\\\" the ThinPrint Cloud Printer\\\" and then NOTHING HAPPENS! The icon in my system tray says \\\"Processing Print Job\\\" forever until it times out and tells me \\\"Unable to complete print job.\\\" Also, no matter what webpage I\\'m trying to print it says it\\'s printing \\\"temp.html\\\", and that seems odd... no unique page names to differentiate print jobs? Meanwhile, my tablet is notifying that ThinPrint successfully completed printing \\\"temp.html\\\". Yeah, right! Frustrated beyond words! I thought this was supposed to be slick and seamless?! The Galaxy Note 8.0 is a pretty newly released tablet though... Maybe ThinPrint just hasn\\'t kept up with the latest devices? Bummer. I had high hopes based on all the great reviews.",
