Jade Thirwall fondos de Pantalla, imagines de Pantalla y wallpaper.Jade Amelia Thirlwall, born 26 December 1992 (age 20), is from South Shields, Tyne and Wear. She was born to single mother Norma and lived with her brother Karl.[citation needed] At first, she was a student and participated in various singing contests in the area. She is close friends with The X Factor series 6 winner, Joe McElderry, who is also from South Shields. The pair used to duet together. She has previously auditioned on series 5 in 2008 and on series 7 in 2010, but only made it into the end of the bootcamp stage. Thirlwall has been compared to Cheryl Cole by The Mirror, who she says is one of her idols alongside BeyoncÃ© Knowles and One DirectionJade Thirlwall is a member of Little Mix. Little Mix are a British four-piece girl group formed in 2011, consisting of members Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall. They were formed exclusively for the eighth series of The X Factor, where they became the first group entry to win in the programme's eight-year history. Following their victory, they signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records. The group subsequently signed in the United States with Columbia Records. Little Mix have been branded the next Spice Girls as well as the UK's next biggest girl group capable of international success. After winning they released their first single, a version of Damien Rice's \"Cannonball\". They released their debut album, DNA, on 19 November 2012.Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall successfully auditioned as soloists for the eighth series of The X Factor in 2011, but failed to make it past bootcamp's first challenge. However, the judges decided to give them another chance to be part of the Groups category. They were then put into separate ensembles by the judges during the group's bootcamp stage, with Edwards and Nelson in four-member group Faux Pas and Thirlwall and Pinnock in three-member group Orion. However, both groups failed to make it through to the judges' houses. A later decision saw two members from each group being called back to form the four-piece group Rhythmix, this sending them through to the judges' houses.They eventually reached the live shows and were mentored by Tulisa Contostavlos. On 26 October 2011, Rhythmix announced that they would change their name following a dispute with a Brighton-based children's music charity of the same name, after the programme tried to trademark \"Rhythmix\". A spokesman for The X Factor said, \"At the request of the charity Rhythmix, the members of the girl group Rhythmix have decided to change their name, a decision which has the support of Syco and TalkbackTHAMES.\" It was reported that the band decided to make the change, despite no legal reason to do so, to avoid any difficulties for the charity. On 20 November 2011, Little Mix became the first girl group in the show's eight-year history to progress past the seventh live show. The previous longest-surviving girl groups were The Conway Sisters (series 2) and Hope (series 4), who had both lasted until live show 7. On 11 December, Little Mix were announced as the winners, making them the first ever group to win the show.",
