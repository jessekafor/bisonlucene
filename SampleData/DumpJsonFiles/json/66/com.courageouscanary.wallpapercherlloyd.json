Cher Loyd fondos de Pantalla, imagines de Pantalla y wallpaper.Cher Lloyd (born 28 July 1993) is an English singer and rapper. Lloyd rose to fame when she finished fourth in the seventh series of The X Factor. Shortly afterwards, Lloyd was signed by Simon Cowell to Sony Music subsidiary Syco Music. Cher Lloyd's debut single \"Swagger Jagger\" was released in June 2011. The single entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the Irish Singles Chart. Her second single \"With Ur Love\" was released on 31 October, featuring Mike Posner, and peaked at number four in the UK, and number five in Ireland, preceding her debut album Sticks + Stones, which peaked at number four in the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the Irish Albums Chart. She debuted her third single \"Want U Back\" on 22 May 2012 in the United States. She has been compared to Cheryl Cole and Mike Posner. Top hits include Sticks + Stones and The X Factor.Cher Lloyd is a singer she grew up in the town of Malvern in Worcestershire with her parents Darren and Dina and her three younger siblings. Cher is of Romani extraction from her mother's side. Lloyd attended Dyson Perrins CE Sports College, where she studied performing arts. She also attended theatre arts school Stagecoach.Lloyd had previously auditioned for The X Factor twice before (when the minimum age was lower) singing ballads, but did not make it through. Lloyd has previously performed at holiday camps and said she gets a mixed reaction to her music, but was a big hit with x-factor judge at the time Cheryl Cole. She remarked on their similarity and Cheryl went on to support her throughout the show. She auditioned singing the Keri Hilson version of \"Turn My Swag On\". At bootcamp she sang a rap version of \"Viva La Vida\" adding lyrics she claimed to have written herself, but this was disputed and reports claimed she took them from a song by rapper Swizz Beatz. At the judges' houses she performed \"Cooler Than Me\" but suffered from tonsillitis and was unable to complete her song. She was given a second chance, but broke down sobbing and could not complete the song. Despite this, she was still picked as one of the final three girls by mentor Cheryl Cole.Lloyd sang a rendition of \"Just Be Good to Me\" in the first of the live shows. In the second live show she sang \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". In the third live show, she sang a mashup of \"No Diggity\" and \"Shout\", and in the fourth live show she sang \"Stay\". This was the first time Lloyd did not rap in her performance, and Cowell even called it \"the performance of the season\". In week five, Lloyd sang \"Empire State of Mind\", but judges stated that after last week they were disappointed, and Cowell said it was copycat. However, the judges agreed that she redeemed herself with her rendition of \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" mixed with \"Mockingbird\", by Elton John and Eminem respectively, in week 6. In the seventh week, Lloyd was in the bottom two for the first time after her rendition of \"Imagine\", but Cowell, Cole and Walsh all saved her in the final showdown, resulting in Paije Richardson being eliminated. In the following week Lloyd performed \"Girlfriend\", followed by \"Walk This Way\". Both performances were credited by the judges and she was saved by the public vote the following night, securing her position in the semi final. In the semi-final, Lloyd performed \"Nothin' on You\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" and was in the bottom two with Mary Byrne.",
