        "comment": "I\\'ve finally found an app that at least SUPPORTS three and four players as well. However, it\\'s really poorly done... Why oh why can\\'t you just let the screen scroll down to the other players instead of how awkwardly it works now? Not that there isn\\'t A LOT of more room on the screen, so they would even fit without scrolling... I would also like to see an option to hide the timer and to hide the poison counter, not just renaming it.",
