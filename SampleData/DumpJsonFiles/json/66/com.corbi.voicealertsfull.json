Configure repeat mode for missed calls alert. Configure it to not speak while your are calling.Time changes: it can be configured to \"speak\" the current time in 15,30 and 60 minutes intervals.  For instance: \"it is 20 hours 15 minutes\" . 12H format configurable.Sms received: A voice alert informs the user that a new sms is received, it can be configured to read the content as well. And to translate the most common sms abbreviations (in the 5 supported languages) while reading the content for instance: c u l8r -> see you later.Battery alerts: The user can specify a battery level (for instance 5%), below that level the app alerts the user with a voice message about the current battery status. Also, when the battery is completely loaded or to alert of the progress when its being loaded. Fully configurable.Memory alerts: A voice alert informs the user when the memory level is too low. When the battery has been completely loaded...Message on Boot: You android welcomes you with a customized message.Application Installed/uninstalled: It will be informed when an application package is being installed or removed.Network availability: Your android informs you when the connection to the network is interrumpted ( in an elevator or tunnel) and re-established.Wifi connections: Informs you when your phone connects to a wifi network or an open one is found.TWIDROID integration, now your android phone will tell you the twitter messages the user you are following post and the replies or direct messages you received.
