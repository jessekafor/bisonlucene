I really want the metrics to be accurate- its essential for this app.   I honestly cant believe you are charging so much money for an app with so many glitches. Overall, the most recent update was a big step forward, so please continue the progress and spend more time and effort fixing ALL the annoying glitches and complaints from this User Review area.   I\\'ll tell you what- fix the glitches in the next 48 hours and I will make it a point to recommend this course to 10 of my accounting friends. That\\'s thousands of dollars in your pocket, just for being moderately responsive to your customers wishes.  Waiting...  -Bryan",
