    "description": "Information overload is a problem in every facet of business & daily life. Arguably nowhere is the noise greater than in vested interest world of Economies & Financial markets. The BULL & BEAR breakdown provides a daily look at global markets, general themes and macro results; in essence a financial \"Drudge report\" with the difference being this commentary has teeth.Offering views (not to mention irreverence), highlighting the better comments from the brighter minds of the industry and hopefully provoking thought outside of the world of received wisdom.This application let's you read a rundown on the US markets, the Treasury market, commodities, key earnings, key global macro events, key global market events, investment themes and the better stories from the greater minds around the financial world.\"The scribbler\", who authors this piece, is sadly far removed from being a teenager, but has spent all of his working life in the ever evolving financial machine. This allows him to offer perspective and a jaundiced view of the markets, consensus vested interests, and to champion risk as a premise for decision-making.Above all this report hopes to step outside the dry and antiseptic world of financial reporting, and offer a fresher, honest look at what's what in the financial markets that whether we like or not (and none of us do like it) has a baring on everything we do.If you will, this report is more Private Eye or Jon Stewart's \"Daily Show\".âââ Testimonials âââHedge Fund Principle: \"I really like your work! Informative and amusing, a rare combination.\"Fixed Income Portfolio Manager \"Compulsive reading. Thanks for some great thoughts\".âââ Trial version âââThis app stays free during the first few months but will require an in-app purchase at a later stage.âââ The information in this app has been prepared for informational purposes only.
