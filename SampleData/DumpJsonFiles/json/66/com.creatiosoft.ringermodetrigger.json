    "description": "What if you kept your mobile in your pocket or drawer and forgot that it was still in silent mode? You might miss your most urgent calls and messages which need your immediate attentionâ¦What to do?????Download this free âSilent Mode Togglerâ and get rid of all such worries. This toggler can override your default mobile settings temporarily. It toggles your phone from silent mode to ringing/ vibrating mode as soon as you receive a call from a person whose call you just cannot afford to miss even when the mobile is in silent mode. All you have to do is to select contacts for which you want to enable this utility (i.e. toggling from silent mode to ringing/ vibrating mode).What more, this utility also works for incoming messages from the list of contacts for which this toggle utility is applied.This toggler (or ringer toggle utility) comes in two options: Semi-Ring and Fully-Ring.    a.) Semi-Ring: As soon as there is a call/ message from the selected contacts is over, the mobile reverts to the default settings i.e. the silent modeb.)  Fully-Ring: As soon as there is a call/ message from the selected contacts is over, the mode of mobile is changed over to ringing/ vibrating mode for every call from then onwardsHence, as you get a call or a message from the selected contacts, your mobileâs ringing mode will get toggled from silent to ringing mode without losing the current volume settings. The phone will again go to silent mode when your call is over.This toggler or the toggle utility helps you personalize your mobile. This enables you to personalize your important contacts whose calls or messages you canât afford to ignore or miss while being in silent mode. So, no more missing calls and messages of people close to your heart even if you are in a meeting or a class room.Features: 1. Toggles your mobile phone from silent mode to ringing/ vibrating mode for selected callers.2. Applies to both â incoming calls and messages3. Option to enable this feature for any number of contacts.4. Can override your default mobile settings temporarily. 5. Option to bring your mobile back to the default setting (silent mode), OR, keep the overridden (changed over) settings6. Help screen is also there to help you out in case you stuck.Freely keep your mobile in drawers and even pocket without worrying about whether the mobile was left in silent mode or ringing/ vibrating mode.Note: All the permissions that the app requires is only for running the app successfully on the phone and no other reason is involved. You can always check the following link for more information. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.htmlSome Important Info:a. Semi Ring Mode: Semi ring mode is the mode in which silent mode is converted to ringing mode for the selected contacts and for non selected contacts it will be same (silent mode).b.
