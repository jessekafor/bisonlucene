The calls and songs are very useful and have been expanded several times since I bought the app. The app on my Asus 7 pad now goes every where with me in the field. It is very useful to be able to identify a species by listening to the song in the app. As this app evolves I hope that more geographic diversity in calls will be added.",

        "comment": "This has greatly improved my bird identification - especially when identifying by ear.  The amount of great recordings you can play back to memorize the bird songs, plus different plumages, range maps, comparison tool, it just works.    It\\'s quick (I compared to the Audobon app my friend has - blows it away in speed).  It doesn\\'t seem to use any data on my phone, (Samsung S3), in my data usage it doesn\\'t even show up.  Not sure how it does this other than it must be pre loading everything via wifi.  This is contradictory to the user below (James Moss)\\'s experience - perhaps the tablet version is different?  I just tested my observation by turning off my Wifi and mobile on phone (flight mode), and the app works just as quick and even looking up birds that I have not previously and playing all the sounds, maps, etc.  The best birding app I have ever used.  One thing that would be nice is an easier way to keep life lists, without having to enter all the details of birds previously seen.  My paper field guide will always be my go-to for life lists though.",

        "comment": "I like Sibley\\'s paper field guide for Eastern Birds...it\\'s my go to book to carry in the field.      But I can\\'t understand why so many folks like the Android app.    The songs are great and drawings are regular Sibley quality but the functionality of the search is awful.    Try to search for a bird by \\\"features\\\" and you get a choice of 8 color combinations and it doesn\\'t include any variation of Brown.   God forbid you\\'re trying to ID one of the Sparrows!  Try to choose a size... you can choose \\\"Sparrow-size\\\" or \\\"Thrush-size\\\" but if it\\'s right in between and you\\'re not sure... well tough luck, you can only choose one size at a time.  How about the Alphabetic search?   I typed in \\\"Indigo Bunting\\\" and got \\\"No results could be found for your search.\\\"   Of course if I scroll down to Buntings, it\\'s right there...  The list of poor functionality goes on and I can only assume it\\'s a better program on the Apple devices.    I gave it 3 stars for the songs and drawings but it\\'s such a pita to use I went back to IBird Pro which is way more functional and incidentally less expensive.    I think Sibley is cashing in on his name selling this for $20 and I feel I\\'ve been ripped off.",

        "comment": "I am a professional naturalist (over 20 years in the field leading bird walks) and have used lots and lots of bird call devices from LP records to tapes to cds to the identi-flyer and even the Cornell Audio books. all of these are wonderful in their own way but some are limited to playing only one or two calls of each bird. in the case of the Northern Cardinal, for example, with at least 8 distinctive calls, this App is Fantastic in that it features a wide array of calls for each species. The range maps are great (key is on each page so i don\\'t have to page back if i forget what each color represents) and even contains additional info from Wikipedia for us that are factoid nuts. I highly recommend this App for professionals, educators, backyard bird enthusiasts and anyone looking for a great bird field guide. Thanks Sibley!",
