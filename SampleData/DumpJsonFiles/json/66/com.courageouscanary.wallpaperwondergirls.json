Wonder girls fondos de Pantalla, imagines de Pantalla y wallpaper.Wonder Girls (Korean: ìëê±¸ì¤, Chinese: å¥è¿¹å¥³å­©, Japanese: ã¯ã³ãã¼ã¬ã¼ã«ãº) is a South Korean girl group, whose current line-up is Yubin, Yeeun, Sunye, Sohee and Hyelim. They are managed by their producer, the singer-songwriter Park Jin-Young under his talent agency, JYP Entertainment. They are co-managed in the United States by Creative Artists Agency. The group's name, 'Wonder Girls', comes from the idea that they are \"the girls who can amaze the world\". The group began their entry into the American market in 2009 as an opening act for The Jonas Brothers' World Tour, performing the English version of their hit single \"Nobody\". In late 2009, their song charted at number seventy-six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making the Wonder Girls the first South Korean group to enter the chart.In 2010, Wonder Girls entered the Chinese market with the compilation album Wonder Girls that included Chinese language versions of \"Tell Me\", \"Nobody\" and \"So Hot\". In 2012, Wonder Girls signed with DefStar Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan, for their Japanese debut.The Wonder Girls were introduced through a TV show titled MTV Wonder Girls. The first four episodes outlined the characteristics and profiles of each member and showcased their schedules for the day. Shortly after selecting Yeeun as the fifth member, the Wonder Girls held their first showcase in the MTV Studio. They performed a cover version of \"Don't Cha\" by the Pussycat Dolls as well as their own songs, including \"Irony\" and \"ë¯¸ìí ë§ì\" (\"It's Not Love\"). Sunye sang her version of Destiny's Child's \"Stand Up for Love\", while Hyuna performed a showcase of her dancing skills. The other three members â Yeeun, Sunmi and Sohee â performed a cover version of Janet Jackson's \"Together Again\".The Wonder Girls officially debuted in early 2007 on MBC's Show! Music Core, performing \"Irony\", the hip-hop single from their first album, The Wonder Begins. The album sold 11,454 physical copies in 2007. The Wonder Girls official fanclub was established, with the name of \"Wonderfuls\". The group held several showcases in China after receiving Chinese lessons. During the rest of 2007, however, members of the Wonder Girls were beset by various injuries and health problems. On June 25, Sohee was sidelined for a month after tearing a knee ligament in a fall from a running motorcycle during the filming of her movie, ë¨ê±°ì´ ê²ì´ ì¢ì (I Like It Hot).The remaining four members continued performing until late July, when Hyuna was withdrawn from the group by her parents due to their concern over her problems with chronic gastroenteritis and fainting spells. In autumn 2007, the talent agency Good Entertainment sent their trainee Yubin to JYP Entertainment as a replacement for Hyuna. They are often compared to 2NE1, Girls' Generation, Miss A, Big Bang. Top albums include. Wonder World, The Wonder Years, The Wonder Years - Trilogy . She made her debut three days later in the group's live performance of \"Tell Me\" on Music Bank.Their first full-length album, The Wonder Years, was released the following week with \"Tell Me\". Due to the last-minute addition of Yubin, the album version does not contain her part. However, the performance version of the song was reworked to include a bridge with rapping by Yubin. The single was a hit and reached number one on",
