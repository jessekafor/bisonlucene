Just type this:  sudo apt-get install openssh-server  Done.  It\\'s also great for playing tricks on unsuspecting people (not that I advocate such a thing). I one time forgot to pause a playlist of a few songs, but luckily, I just whipped out my phone and paused it when I was quite a distance from my computer. Surprised my roommates!",

        "comment": "Interestingly, it does not seem to work. I gave two stars because it is supposed to be the \\\"stable\\\" version of sshmote, which is fantastic. So I assume that if it works it would be as great as sshmote because the interface is nearly the same.  Update: I noticed the update to this some 5 days after I submitted this review. It is now working flawlessly. It is basically sshmote with a better interface and only downloading the controls you need. I really like the custom options!  Good work!",

SSH and dbus accessible on one remote make it a killer combination - and free at that.  While the commands are highly programmable, the remote control layouts aren\\'t. Also, more guidance on your website on how to set up sshd would be great.  Once it\\'s up and running it\\'s great, but really stressful if you\\'ve never used sshd and have never configured your firewall for it. And screen timeout doesn\\'t seem to work",
