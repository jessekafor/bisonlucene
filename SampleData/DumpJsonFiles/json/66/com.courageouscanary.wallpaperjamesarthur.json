James Arthur fondos de Pantalla, imagines de Pantalla y wallpaper.James Andrew Arthur (born 2 March 1988) is an English singer and musician who won the ninth series of The X Factor in 2012. His debut single, \"Impossible\", was released after the final and debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 16 December 2012 in its first week of release. It went on to sell over a million copies.Since 2005, and prior to his participation in The X Factor, he was a vocalist and guitarist in a number of bands, and later as a solo artist, as well as forming The James Arthur Band and James Arthur Project.Arthur was born in Middlesbrough, England to English mother Shirley Ashworth and Scottish father Neil Arthur. James' father was a delivery driver, but also used to be a DJ and a drummer for many years. Arthur's parents split up when he was two years old and each settled with a new partner. Neil and Shirley were not on speaking terms with one another for more than twenty years. But they agreed to attend his audition together in a family reunion.Arthur first went to Ings Farm Primary School in Redcar, North Yorkshire. When he was nine, he moved with his mother Shirley and his stepfather Ronald Rafferty to Bahrain where he studied at the local British School of Bahrain for four years. When they split, Arthur, then 14, had to move back with his mother and his two half-sisters Jasmine and Neve to the UK to live in a modest house in Saltburn-by-the-Sea. Upon his return, he continued his studies at Redcar's Rye Hills School. Arthur has five siblings, an older brother called Neil Arthur, an older sister called Sian Arthur, and three younger sisters, Charlotte Arthur and Jasmin and Neve Rafferty.Arthur auditioned for The X Factor with an acoustic rendition of judge Tulisa Contostavlos's \"Young\", before explaining his past, including spells in care and time spent on the streets after break-ups within his family. He also revealed his father and mother had not spoken to each other for over 20 years, and this was a reunion of sorts for them to attend his audition. After his judges' houses performance of \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", he was picked by his mentor Nicole Scherzinger as one of the 12 contestants for the live shows, and one of three in the \"Boys\" category. After the second live show, Arthur suffered from an anxiety attack backstage. Whilst being treated at the studio, paramedics determined he did not need to go to hospital, and he was ordered back to his hotel to rest. He later returned for the results show the following. Arthur was in the bottom two in week 7 after performing \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\". He sang \"Fallin'\" for survival against Ella Henderson, with the judges going to deadlock after their vote was evenly split 2-2 (mentor Scherzinger and Gary Barlow voting to keep him, while Contostavlos and Louis Walsh voted in favour of Henderson). Arthur was then saved by the public vote. On 8 December, he made it through to the second night of the live finals.",
