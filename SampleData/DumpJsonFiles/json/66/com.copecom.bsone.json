        "comment": "Never thought that porting an Amiga game to Android may keep the play-ability and atmosphere of original version, but its possible.  They did a excellent job porting Battle Squadron to Android, it plays like a charm. Happily the developers decided to keep the game free of \\'In App Purchases\\' and Ads, so you really get a full game without limitations for your money. Unfortunately there a some points preventing it being perfect:  - There is no save state. If you exit the game you have to restart the next time you play. Fortunately the game pauses if you switch tasks, so you have to keep the game in background if you want to continue it later. - Please add local high-scores in addition to open feint. I want to  compare my score only with the score of my brother (or my own progress) and not with the hole community and I\\'m not always online while playing.  Nevertheless, great game! Btw. Developer answers eMails quite fast, so 5 Stars.",

Even though this is an older game it holds its own with newer shooters and I recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre.  The only suggestion I would have would be an in-game volume adjustment. It seems extremely loud compared to other games and I end up having to adjust my phone volume directly which screws up the volume I set it at for everything else. Otherwise it\\'s very good.",
