    "description": "Please consider the Donate to Education Version: Apps for Education Donationread the http://cp2-software.tumblr.com\"> Apps for Education storyHave you ever wanted to get into your car and when Bluetooth connects to your phone the music just starts playing where it left off in the player of your choice?This app is designed to tie the Bluetooth connect event to playing the music player of your choice.  Unlike other auto-play options, this allows you to select the specific player that should be used.   Do you want Spotify instead of Google Music Player, you can select that, do you want TuneIn instead of the Core Android music player, no problem.Why would you want this?  Some Bluetooth receivers do not play at all, some target the stock music player, this puts you in control of what happens when Bluetooth audio connects.**Important Note**This App assumes you already have the subject Bluetooth device Paired to your phone using the BT device manufacturer's unique approach.   It won't help Pair the device, the list that shows (as in the App picture) is a list of Paired (sometimes called Bonded) devices.  This App starts a Music App by package name and broadcasts \"play\" to start the player.  NOT all players support this.  Some players that work:  * Google Play Music  * Core Music Player  * DoubleTwist  * Android Music  * Rocket Player  * iHeart Radio:   Best if you select \"Play last station on startup\"  * Pandora:   Must select \"Bluetooth for Automotive\" in settings  * TuneIn:   Best if you select \"Auto restart Player\"  * Slacker:   Best if you select \"Resume Play on Startup\"  * Spotify  * Maple MP3 player.   Note: Must set \"Respond to Headset Buttons\" to ONFor a Bluetooth device to play music, it must support the A2DP standard, otherwise it can't stream music  (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_profile)",

This app along with Llama allows me to get in my car and have the music start playing without the phone ever leaving my pocket!  One note:either this or llama causes my default lock screen to show instead of  widget locker.",

        "comment": "I was thrilled to find something that is effective in minimizing my keystrokes when I want to stream audio from my phone. I regularly use Pandora in the car and this works excellently in my VW. As soon as Bluetooth connects, Pandora starts right up.  Before I had to swipe up, unlock w/my PIN, click Pandora, etc.  It\\'s seamless now!  Room for improvement (and losing one star): 1. Fails to work for launching Pandora when the car\\'s Bluetooth doesn\\'t support A2DP. I would like it to work regardless of A2DP beca  EDIT: the updates for A2DP vs. any bluetooth connection  are working great...thanks! Bumping up a star to 5-stars for the enhancement and quick response...thanks!",

Be nice to auto close the audio app when it disconnects too,  but maybe too much to ask.",
