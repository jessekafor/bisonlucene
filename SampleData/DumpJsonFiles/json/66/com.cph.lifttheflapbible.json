        "comment": "When I open the app, it gets stuck on \\\"Checking for full version\\\".  My son is autistic and can\\'t read books whatsoever. But he does know how to use my tablets. So how am I going to get him to know more about the bible (outside church), if crappy apps like these don\\'t even start up.  Oh and did Jesus ask to be paid first before sharing the gospel??? Shame on you! Greed is a sin and I\\'m wondering if this app was developed by a true Christian or by a Jezabel?!",

        "comment": "My children in enjoy this app. The unfortunate thing is that when you get to the end of the bible there is no sound on the lift-a-flap section. That is kind of disappointing. Also, I upgraded to the paid version and was disappointed to see that the story ends at easter, where is the resurrection and the ascension? It would be really nice to see additional content added to application! That would make it worth it even that much more.",
