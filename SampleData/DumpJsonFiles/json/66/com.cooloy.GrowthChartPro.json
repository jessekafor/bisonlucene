    "description": "\"Growth Chart Pro\" helps you to keep track of your childrenâs growth from birth to 20 years old.  It accurately calculates the growth percentile of the weight, height and head circumference based on age and gender, using the most recent US CDC and WHO data, the same data that are used by your pediatrician. You can add multiple children (Pro version only) and save all your data to the database for future review. The saved data can be viewed as tables, or as graphs (measured values vs. ages, or percentiles vs. ages). It provides you with the median value of weight/height/head CC at your childrenâs age, and you can get the values at any percentile by easily sliding the percentage bar. So you can compare your childrenâs growth with that of others, and log your childrenâs growth history and learn the trend. Key features include:-Keep track growth of multiple children (Lite supports only one child);-Save data to SD card (Pro and Lite) or restore the saved data from SD (Pro only); -Provide growth data for infant, toddler, teenager and youth below 20 years old;-Support multiple units for measures, including lb/oz/ft/in and cm/kg;-Log and view the growth history;-Analyze data using tales or graph.Keywords: baby growth chart, tracker, plot, graphical, weight, height, head CC, boy, girls, percent, pound, ounce, feet, inch, centime, kilogram, regular checkup, pediatric, development, developmental, doctor, center for disease control, world health organization",

        "comment": "Yes the percentiles are wrong however it is a good basic tracker and has a graph option. Yes you have to buy the app to add more then one child but I haven\\'t found another app that you can actually add more then one AND it\\'s only $1.99. I am having a problem though when I added a second child I tried to put the birth weight and height but it says I can\\'t pick a date before the child\\'s birth... which I obviously haven\\'t.",

        "comment": "If you are a mom wanting to keep track of your child(ren) this is great.  If you are a health professional and expecting the percentile results to be accurate for either CDC or WHO charts, they are not.  Nor does it measure %ile rankings above or below the 3-97% range as some kids may fall.  Nor does it measure wt/lth percentiles or BMI which is the gold standard of assessing a child\\'s growth.  I hope they improve it because the idea is fantastic - it just falls short.",
