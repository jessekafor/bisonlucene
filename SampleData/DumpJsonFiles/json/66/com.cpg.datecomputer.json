    "description": "Do you know how many days you have lived so far? How many years, months and days you have been working? How many days are left until the New Year? Or maybe, how many days you have been engaged or married? Date Computer may answer all these questions easily. If you want, Date Computer may also post the result on your Facebook wall and share them with your relatives and friends. For example: \"I have been working for 8 years, 3 months and 21 days\".Date Computer is a free and easy to use calculator that computes the day of the week for a provided date. Also, it calculates the day difference between two entered dates. The result is shown both in total days and in years, months and days. An additional feature is the ability to enter a date and a number of years (0-99), months (0-11) and days (0-31). The application will add (or subtract, if desired) that time to the original date and compute the resulting date. Instead of years, months and days it is possible to specify a total number of days (0-9999). Use years and months equal to zero in this case. Date selection is very easy. It uses a rotating wheel to select the desired year, month and day.Recent improvements: Added a settings screen to select a language (English/Spanish at this time) and color intensity (Strong/Soft). Added a Help screen and an About screen (shown in the selected language). Also, now you may post the date difference calculated by Date Computer on your Facebook Wall. You choose the format (total number of days or number of years, months and days) and select from a list of predefined messages or enter your own. The message list is shown in English or Spanish depending on your language setting. The Facebook post screen allows you to add longer comments to the chosen message.Definitively, you will have a lot of fun using Date Computer! Please recommend it to your friends.Disclaimer: âThis free app is ad supported and may contain ads in the notification tray and/or home screen.â",
