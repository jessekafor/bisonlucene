        "comment": "This is a good app, but it needs updating. It is based on the first edition of the print book, but there is (and has been for months) a second edition of the book that corrects several mistakes in the first edition (and that are thus also found in this app). An update would raise my rating to 4 stars.",

I emailed the support address for either a workaround to get it running, or a refund, but I haven\\'t heard anything at all.  I just want my money back at this point",

        "comment": "There is really not much to this app. There is no introductory background information and the descriptions of the species are very brief. Graphics and photos are ok but not great. The app displays in landscape mode on my tablet but it is clearly not designed for that orientation. I really expected more for the steep price. After using this app I appreciate the Audobon mammals app much more.",
