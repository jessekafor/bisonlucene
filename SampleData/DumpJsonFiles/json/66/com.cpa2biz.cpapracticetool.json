    "description": "CPA2Biz, a subsidiary of The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), has teamed with Geoffrey Moore, a nationally recognized author and Silicon Valley based high technology consultant, to develop a quick and easy method to help professional CPA practices determine their âPractice Maturity Stageâ. Client Accounting Services historically has been perceived as a low-value, low-margin service. Our white paper, âAccounting Services: Harness the Power of the Cloudâ by Geoffrey Moore, describes three mega-trends that are redefining the business landscape and reshaping both the value and the margin opportunities for CPAs.  The impact of these trends is traced through well defined âstagesâ of evolution in the practice, each of which has seen some adoption in recent yearsThe \"CPA Practice Assessment Tool\" will, based on your answers to a series of questions, calculate your practiceâs âmaturity stageâ and provide a short summary of strategies that might be best suited for you in moving to the next stage.  For further information please also read our white-paper or contact us at CPA2Biz.",
