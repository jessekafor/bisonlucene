The interface is made up of unintelligible icons with no description, the \\\"tutorial\\\" is joke, with no explanations. I play smt, still cannot figure it out.   Worse of all, nearly all the upgrades are locked except fpr 2 or 3 unless you buy the game or get some achievements whose requisites are a mystery. The combat would be interesting if it would  explain anything. Terrible game. Why does this have good ratings??",
