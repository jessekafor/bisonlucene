    "description": "NEW Ghost hunting Technology!Turns your Android device into a working âSpirit Boxâ.*TOP 20 IN GOOGLE PLAY LIFESTYLE APPS!*USED AND TRUSTED BY BILL MURPHY OF TV'S FACT OR FAKED. BARRY FITZGERALD & ROBB DEMAREST FROM GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL.**NEW VERSION 2.3**I am so happy to announce the release of the Sv-1 SpiritVox Ghost Box for Android Version 2.3! (SEE \"WHAT'S NEW\") NEW AUDIO ENGINES RECORDING FUNCTION AND FILE BROWSER!ALL NEW CHANNEL B!This is the  update since the app launch 3 months ago. I was working on a new way to produce the random noise and create a whole new audio engine for SpiritVox 2.0. However, unable to decide which to use in the new version I decided to include BOTH audio generators! There are 2 channels of random noise. Channel 1 is the ORIGINAL SV-1 SpiritVox sound proven to work by Ghost Hunters around the world & Channel B, the NEW SpiritVox Random carrier signal. The NEW \"Noise Blend\" feature allows you to blend the 2 signals any way you wish for more ways to experiment.Also fixed: App now runs in the background allowing you to record on the same device. (User requested) Added social bookmarks and blog link / Exit on menu press.I am now recommending leaving wifi on and using headphones due to the overwhelming amount of reports of this being effective by SpiritVox users. I hope you enjoy this new version of the SV-1. I cannot wait to hear what you catch!*******This Ghost hunting / Paranormal investigation app uses your devices internal audio playback algorithms to generate 2 sets of random carrier sounds that changes every 8th of a second. The 2 channels of random sounds can be blended as you wish. Channel A is the original SV-1 sound and channel B is the NEW audio engine sound. Created with hundreds of random sounds from static to speech.Trusted and used by thousands of Paranormal researchers around the world from professional to amateur. Thousand of results reported worldwide. SpiritVox has been used in the worlds most haunted locations by some of the most famous and well respected ghost hunters in the US, Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. NO false positives. Guaranteed to be free of all radio interference.THIS APP DOES NOT USE RADIO WAVES!Hardware \"Spirit boxes\" can cost hundreds of dollars and are difficult to build yourself. They are also open to radio interference and random phonetic sounds. The SV-1 SpiritVox is capable of producing results you can be confident in for a FRACTION of a hardware device! This is one tool your research group cannot afford to go without! NOT A NOVELTY ITEM, This APP is designed by ghost hunters for ghost hunters!SpiritVox on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio/videosVersion 2.0 Audio Demo http://spiritvox.bigbeardaudio.com/?p=160###PLEASE NOTE: users are reporting results with wifi and data etc enabled. Some report that voices and sounds  are clearer or louder this way. Feel free to experiment and try for yourself. It does seem possible to me that the wireless signal could aid in this phenomenon. ###*For best results turn your devices volume to 10, place on a hard surface with your device speaker facing down and prop the device up 1/2 to 1 inch above the surface. External speakers are recommended if you are using a phone without a loud speaker. Tablet speakers have been found to work very well and seem to be loud enough on their own.PLEASE NOTE: Results may vary! Please don't rate  low if you don't hear a ghost, neither me or anyone else can guarantee this will happen! SpiritVox is trusted and used by over 200 Paranormal Research teams around the world! Including North London Paranormal, Paranormal Moms, ParaSpin Paranormal,BAT Paranormal, ghost Night Events UK and more!Questions? Got results you would like to share?

Stop and find out if you know what a spirit box is before spouting out of your facehole about how fake it is. The Dev works hard on thus stuff and one of these days might just give up cause you people don\\'t have the intelligence to understand the physics behind the program.",

I will keep trying to use for a while but will probably end up deleting if you don\\'t loose the looped voices that are on here. I will come back and give 5 stars when and if this is fixed.",

A useful tool in case you forget your spirit box, and a useful tool all on its own.  I love this app.",
