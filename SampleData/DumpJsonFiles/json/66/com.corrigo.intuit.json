I started using it on Android and was really hoping it would have the same features, i.e. ability to create a work order, search work orders, reassign work orders, customer history, etc.. however was extremely disappointed that it has yet to be updated to include these features. Until they do an update, I will be looking up another similar system that will have everything and will be a lot cheaper.",
