    "description": "The 34th Annual Meeting & Scientific Sessions of the Society of Behavioral Medicine will take place March 20-23, 2013, at the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, California. Embodying the meeting theme, âTechnology: The Excitement and the Evidence,â the conference program will explore the many ways that technological innovations are expanding the reach and impact of behavioral medicine. Research coinciding with other behavioral medicine topics such as health promotion, decision making, chronic disease prevention, physical activity and more will also be represented through panel discussions, symposia, seminars, and paper and poster presentations. The 2013 SBM Annual Meeting will facilitate networking and idea exchange among researchers, practitioners, policy advocates and students from such disciplines as psychology, nursing, medicine and public health.",
