        "comment": "Works a treat. Booked a cab using the app, then phoned straight after to enquire about the price and the operator had my booking in front of her. Cracking. Only gets a 4/5 as they could do with a quote section for your journey, but I understand the restrictions around telling people here\\'s a guestimate and the problems this could cause if fare is then more.",
