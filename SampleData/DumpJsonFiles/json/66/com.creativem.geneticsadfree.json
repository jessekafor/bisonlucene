Animals have various genetic attributes and combining them makes allsorts of weird and wonderful creatures. But unlike some other games, here even the order of the combination can produce different results and the direct wiki link to tell you more about the creature you created is a fab little bonus feature. 5* from me. Awesome.",

And their is no list of animals and characteristics yet to be unlocked so you\\'re stuck with trial and error instead of logic. What\\'s worse is that the game will not combine two animals you\\'ve put together but match your chosen animal to one halfway across the screen. Because there\\'s two different ways to match it just becomes a massive exercise in frustration.",
