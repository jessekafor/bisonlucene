The current members are Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho and Chansung. Former leader, Jay Park, official left the group in early 2010.The members of 2PM found their start under Korean musician Park Jin Young, who formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM, and a similar but independent group known as 2AM. 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" (10ì  ë§ì ì 10ì , lit. 10 Points Out of 10 Points), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They achieved their first Number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, The First Album 1:59PM, released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as Hands Up, in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM,  2AM, Miss A, SHINee, Beast. Also present were: Jang Wooyoung, Lee Junho, Jay Park, and other notable acts.The members of 2PM all auditioned (except Nichkhun, who was scouted)) to become part of JYP Entertainment. Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including Jun. K, who had won several singing competitions. Ok Taecyeon, Lee Junho and Chansung had participated in the show SuperStar Survival.[citation needed] Meanwhile, two members were from America: Jaebeom was from the Seattle area, while Nichkhun was from Southern California. Taecyeon spent seven years in Massachusetts before returning to Korea.Originally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as One Day. A documentary called Hot Blood Men captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, Im Daehun, and Yoon Doo-joon were all cut.By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. However, before the group released any studio albums, the band was split into 2AM and 2PM. Most Korean boy bands have adopted a \"pretty boy\" (Korean: ggotminam) image. JYP Entertainment opted to brand them as a more mature group.Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the group's leader, as he was the oldest member and also the one where all the members acknowledged as the most talented one. He would play key roles in several of the band's early singles and associated music videos.2PM debuted with their single \"10 Out of 10\" (10ì  ë§ì ì 10ì ) on 4 September 2008. In October 2008, they began to promote \"Only You\", another song from their debut mini album, Hottest Time of the Day.In April 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change, which they began promoting that month. In May they won their first Mutizen Song award on M!Countdown, followed by two more and a Music Bank award. On 11 June, 2PM began promotions for \"Niga Mipda\" (ëê° ë°ë¤, lit. I Hate You) on M!Countdown. In July 2PM achieved first place on the M!Countdown and Music Bank charts for the song \"Niga Mipda\". On 30 July, 2PM won the 'Only One Song' award on M!Countdown.",
