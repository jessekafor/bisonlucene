    "description": "The \"Decision Maker\" is a simple app implementing the SPen SDK from samsung. This app is specifically built to work on a Samsung Galaxy Note. This app helps you make decisions that you were not able to decide upon. Start the app, think of the question and scratch off the first layer of the app to reveal whether you should do it NO. The graphics are soley designed by me for this app and are catchy.",
