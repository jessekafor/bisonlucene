        "comment": "Love the app, when it works, however I do have issues with it not being able to connect to the corrigo servers. One suggestion to make it better for those of us that us exit in the field - in the notes section on work orders it would be nice to be able to have the option to sketch a note. I would be able to add to any job the location of the water shutoffs, attic access, crawlspace access, floor plans, location of water lines for irrigation, etc..... maybe you could even make it so pictures could be edited.",
