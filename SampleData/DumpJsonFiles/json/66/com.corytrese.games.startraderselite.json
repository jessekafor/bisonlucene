The ability to store money in a faction bank and pick it up at multiple worlds belonging to that faction.  Also, the ability to secure loans from the bank or less reputable sources....the amount you could borrow could be related to your rank, your level, and the difficulty.  If you borrowed from the bank and defaulted, that faction\\'s navy could attempt to collect or imprison you.",
