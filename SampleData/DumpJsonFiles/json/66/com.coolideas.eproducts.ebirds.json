        "comment": "If I have the paper book available, I use that first. The smart search is all but useless. The export function on an older version worked, so I exported my lists. I then bought a new tablet and phone, tried to import my lists, the software says it can\\'t import - now I have to manually input all my lists again. Funny enough, it doesn\\'t export anymore either. Support staff are as useless as the software. Very expensive purchase, and would have been better off buying second book to keep in my car.6 Update: just got worse since the latest update. Now it crashes so often that it has become completely useless. All the new features the developers are boasting about are un-useable.",

Worth every penny!!!",
