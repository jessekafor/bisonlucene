        "comment": "I was the user to find out it this app didn\\'t like Jelly Bean, but the communication and support and rapid fixes was exceptional by digitalmedia There is Possibly still an issue with complete JB compatibility (hence 4 stars), but it seems fairly stable on 2 out of 3 of my devices and I am confident mydigitalmedia will address.  Now I can at least identify the birds I\\'m seeing on my working trip to Dubai. Special thanks to Dianne and her excellent communication.",
