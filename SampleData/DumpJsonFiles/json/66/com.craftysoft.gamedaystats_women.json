        "title": "A port of the men\\'s app that fails in critical areas",
        "comment": "Clearly a port of the associated app for the men\\'s game with only a different field graphic for the women\\'s game.  This tool lacks support for tracking free position shots, free position goals and caused turnovers all critical stats in the womens game.  I gave the app two stars because it can be useful for a parent that simply wants to see how little Jane is doing statistically without worrying about knockouts for FPS or FPG.  Disappointed.",

        "comment": "Kudos for being the only one out there with an APP for girls lacrosse.  Love the ability to be able to live tweet STATs and scores of the game.  Not a huge fan of how quickly you can get out of the program and you lose all your data.  Would be nice to email a map of the hot spots for ground balls and goalie saves.  Would also be nice to keep track of Free Position Shots and small fouls that happen along the way.  Five stars for supporting GLAX.",
