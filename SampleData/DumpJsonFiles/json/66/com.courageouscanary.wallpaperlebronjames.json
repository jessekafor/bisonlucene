Lebron James fondos de Pantalla, imagines de Pantalla y wallpaper.LeBron Raymone James (/lÉËbrÉn/; born December 30, 1984), nicknamed \"King James\", is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) small forward who has also played as a power forward, he has been an NBA champion, the NBA Finals MVP, a three-time NBA MVP, and the NBA Rookie of the Year. James is a nine-time NBA All-Star, and has been named to eight All-NBA teams and four All-Defensive teams. He is also the Cleveland Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer, and holds other franchise records for both the Cavaliers and the Heat. On January 16, 2013, he became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 20,000 career points, at 28 years of age.James played high school basketball at St. Vincent â St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. A three-time \"Mr. Basketball of Ohio\", he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Heat in a highly publicized free agency period. In 2012, he led Miami to their second NBA title in franchise history, winning his first overall. His career achievements and leadership role during the Heat's 2012 championship run have led a majority of basketball analysts, experts, and writers to consider him the best player in the NBA today, including Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. He has also been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials, and has hosted the ESPY Awards and Saturday Night Live alongside Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.James officially became a member of the Heat on July 9, completing a sign-and-trade six-year contract with the team. With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the collective bargaining agreement, he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support. That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"big three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. Outside of Miami the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.Throughout the 2010â11 season, James embraced the villain role bestowed upon him by the media. He later said that the negativity surrounding him as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period \"basically turned me into somebody I wasn't ... You start to hear 'the villain,' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I've never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that's mentally. That's not the way I play the game of basketball.\"",
