        "comment": "This keeps my family on task and up-to-date. We have 4 children ages 9-16 and they all have this loaded on their devices. A few suggestions would be: 1) Let us customize the computer month view so everything isn\\'t so mashed together. 2) Please incorporate a way to customize the widgets on the mobile devices, would LOVE to be able to scroll on the widgets. 3) Need more widget sizes to choose from (like Calengoo). This has so much potential I hope you spend some time improving it.",
