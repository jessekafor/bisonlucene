        "comment": "Nobody I know had an easy time using this app this year, and this was my first year with the app and I had major disappointment. 1)Rotating my phone caused it to crash. 2)Clicking an event often caused it to crash. 3)It might actually be simpler to list the things that didn\\'t cause it to crash: not using it. 4)Of course, crashiness was a problem when I was able to click on an event at all. Most of the time, I could see that the event existed, but the description and location wouldn\\'t load on the first 5-10 clicks. Usually it would then crash and I\\'d restart it.  Honestly, I don\\'t care about the social networking part of the app. I want to be able to pull up my app and see when and where my next event is EASILY, and this wasn\\'t the case.  Also, I don\\'t want to be forced updates on opening the app EVERY time. Esp. in the middle of Con, I\\'m trying to get around quickly and forcing the cancel eats valuable time (plus, it\\'s not like there\\'s much signal to work with during the event).  Finally: every time I opened the schedule I was reset to Thursday. If it\\'s Sunday, I don\\'t really care what was going on three days earlier, do I? I\\'d much rather have it smart-start on the actual day.",
