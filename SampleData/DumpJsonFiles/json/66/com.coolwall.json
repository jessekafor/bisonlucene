    "description": "Top Gear Cool Wall App Sponsored by Samsung/Phones 4UAnd now, it's time for the Cool Wall App... Now you can create your own Cool Walls, and rearrange the show Cool Wall itself. Using over 350 cars, you can place the cars where you think they should be on the Cool Wall and find out if the presenters think you've got it right in an audio sound bite. All the images of the cars are complete with stats. Be warned though, the car stats are highly suitable as slightly dodgy pub facts, but use sparingly when you need to win an argument. Where there was more than one model, we simply picked our favourite. For the most accurate stats, the car reviews section of www.topgear.com/uk/car-reviews is still the place to go.",

Optimize it for android, make sliding from wall to wall smooth, make navigation smooth, make selection smooth. Also the pictures are all grainy it looks terrible. Make the pictures bigger once they are placed in the wall because your wasting about 95% of the walls space. All in all just optimize it and will be fine.",

If they added a few things such as a \\'shuffle\\' button so it selects a random car and then you decide where it goes that would be cool and if the cars were placed more logically on the wall instead of listing down vertically? Why? How about horizontal? If these two issues were addressed it would be a million times better. Oh and if they got rid of those stupid commentry captions for when you select a place for a car to go-Its my cool wall why are you telling me where to put cars?",
