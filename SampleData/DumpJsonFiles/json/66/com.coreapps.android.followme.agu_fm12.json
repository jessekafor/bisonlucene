For example, a \\\"home\\\" button would have been nice. In addition, the overall organization was weird.",

If you choose oral or poster - same thing, instead of e.g. Biogeochemistry:Oral etc. -- Bookmarking particular talks or abstracts is hard since you have to open the talk two layers down, it doesn\\'t have a star icon next to talk title. -- In session has topics-authors-abstracts subsections, topics are exactly the same as abstracts, but if you click on topic, it is higher level. -- Once you bookmark it, or even look at the talk and go back to session level - it returns you to the top of the session, which is particularly annoying with long poster sessions. -- When I add new session it keeps reminding that I already have something planned for the time. It is fine for oral, but for posters it is supposed to be this way, especially since they are 6 hour long sessions. -- Search by topic returns Dec 31 as a day for all results, which is not true.",
