        "comment": "My husband also has this app. When something comes up that he needs to know about, this app will notify him. He can add to the shopping list if he runs out of something. To-do lists for both of us. Calendar will notify either of us when an appt is coming up. All syncs to website for free. I like printing my calendar to put up on fridge. VERY customizable, easy to use. I recommend paying the $4.99 a month for the gold option, not a necessity, but has some nice extras.",
