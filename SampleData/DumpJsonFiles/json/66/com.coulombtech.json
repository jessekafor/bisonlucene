With the ChargePoint App, EV drivers can navigate, access and charge at ANY electric vehicle charging station.  For electric vehicle drivers, using ChargePoint is the easiest, most convenient way to charge your EV.  ChargePoint gives Drivers access to thousands of public charging stations, an updated âlist viewâ to see exactly how far you are from your destination, convenient payment options, 24x7 driver support and valuable driver services.Use your ChargePoint App to:â¢ Find charging stations near you or near any specified address.â¢ Get turn-by-turn directions to charging stations.â¢ See the real-time availability of charging stations: Available or In Use.â¢ Start and stop charging sessions directly from your smart phone. (*)â¢ Get directions from your current location to where your vehicle is charging. (*)â¢ Get status on your current or most recent charging session: energy used, greenhouse gas savings, time. (*)â¢ Receive real-time notifications of your current charging session. (*)(*) Some features require a ChargePoint driver account with an activated ChargePoint card.

        "comment": "only used the app twice so far. the app requires internet service to function. as a new user I don\\'t have a card yet, so I used the Android app to activate the charge station, but it\\'s difficult to activate charge stations that are underground due to lack of cell internet service. I had to walk outside to activate the charging session then walk back to my car to plug in. I found app easy to use to find charging locations that were not in use,check usage,balance,ect.",

        "comment": "This app does\\'t have enough info, nor are the locations accurate enough, and they don\\'t let users correct errors.  For instance, in Monterey, CA the chargers at the Del Monte mall are not accurately located on the map, users have to view other user comments to find them, not very friendly.  Also,in Monterey at the hotel Clement chargers they don\\'t tell you that you have to pay for parking, but the app only tells you that the charging is free.  Does work well to start, monitor and stop charging process.",
