    "description": "âCar Maintenance Reminder Liteâ is an all-in-one car application that helps you to: (1). Keep track of mileage, fuel efficiency and cost; (2). Log services, and get maintenance reminder when a due date approaches. For the fuel logging function, the application automatically generates useful statistics about MPG, gas price, driving distance per day, volume per fill up, cost per day etc. It also provides TEN graphical charts (2.0.1 and up) for detailed and clear reports of your carâs mileage, fuel economy, costs etc.For the maintenance reminder function, the application provides comprehensive logging and reminders for almost all regular car services based on both mileage and dates, such as oil change, tire rotation, wheel alignment, air filter change, coolant flush, transmission fluid change, brake pad change, timing belt replacement, annual inspection and spark plug replacement. Even more, you can create your own customized service reminders, log costs, and write notes about your cars, such as part number, state registration, appointment time, mechanic shop phone number etc. With just a glance at your phone, you will have all the service records at hand! Notifications at status bar will automatically show up to remind you when a service is due within a week, or 200 miles, so that you will never miss a needed maintenance. You can manage multiple cars in the application (Pro only), export data to external SD card and restore the saved data. You can also create a CSV report containing all service reminders, full maintenance history and gas fill up records. The app can also email the CSV to your E-mail so that you can open the report from your computer using Excel!We made the application very flexible to suite all kinds of needs: You can use the app for your cars, or your motorcycles; Multiple units are supported (km/mi, US gal/UK gal/liter); You can choose your own currency symbol or date format; You can arrange the order of maintenance depending on their importance, customize the application to only show information you care about, and choose reminders you want to get; You can also customize the frequency of reminders showing in the status bar. With the application, you can keep track of everything about your cars, save money, extend their life, and have a safer car!EXCLUSIVE features for the Pro version:-\tAdd unlimited number of cars;-\tRestore saved data from SD card;-\tBackup to CSV and email the CSV file to your E-mail;-\tNo advertisement/popup and no data usage.For more info or technical supports, please visit the website: http://www.cooloy.com.ABOUT PERMISSIONS:CMR Lite can be upgraded in two ways: (1). download the paid Pro version, or (2). unlock all features in app through GetJar Gold (earn for Free!). For GetJar rewards, the app requires a few extra permissions (these are in the Lite version only, the full version has no ads or extra permissions). Below is a description of required permissions:>>INTERNET ACCESS/ VIEW NETWORK STATE - Used by Google Advertisement, GetJar Rewards and cloud backup.>>READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY - Used to access the device ID to uniquely identify the device (for GetJar Rewards). This does not give me access to password or any other personal info;>>GET_ACCOUNTS - This is used by GetJar to identify users across multiple devices. This way, features upgraded through GetJar will still be available if you change your phone and reinstall the app on a new device.>>GET_TASKS - Used to determine if a sponsored app (installed to earn free GetJar gold) has been opened so that the gold can be awarded to you and be used to upgrade features.>>STORAGE - Used to backup/restore data on the SD Card.>>BOOT_COMPLETED - Used to start the background process for automatic databackup and maintenance reminder in status bar (can be disabled in âMenu -> General Settings ->Enalbe Background Servicesâ).",
