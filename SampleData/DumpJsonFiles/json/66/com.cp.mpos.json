        "comment": "I changed over to Chase, they sent my swipper and it has never worked.  They have replaced the swipe reader, and they keep telling me that there is an update that should resolve the problem... next month... I have really been patient up to now, but it is getting old when I have to key in the info every time I take a CC.",

        "comment": "The card reader will not work with a Samsung S3. Don\\'t waste your time trying to make it happen despite the fact that the S3 is on Chase\\'s list of supported devices. It has worked on every iPhone I\\'ve attached it to but it simply will not function on the S3. It\\'s the phone that\\'s the problem,  not the app. You can key in the transaction but you can\\'t swipe the card.",

        "comment": "I love chase bank. Have banked with them for ling time. This is the first time I had a bad experience with them. First reader came and didn\\'t work on my phone. Spent an hour on the phone with technical support - no luck. They sent me a replacement - same story, doesn\\'t work. Everytime I called technical support they were rude, and not helpful. Cancel the account without ever being able to use the card reader and got stuck with almost $200 set up and activation fees which they refuse to refund",
