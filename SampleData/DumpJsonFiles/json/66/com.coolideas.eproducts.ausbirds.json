Please ensure you use a WiFi connection to prevent additional data costs.Michael Morcombe's Field Guide to Australian Birds has been called the most comprehensive field guide to Australian birds in the market today and now it is perfectly complimented by the eGuide which features:â Optimised controls â swipe to next or previous species, one-tap enlargement of an image and rotate the device (landscape) to enlarge an image completely (and fit the width of the screen).â Over 3000 hi-res bird images covering over 790 bird species.â Most bird species have a detailed distribution map showing any subspecies that occur.â Detailed text descriptions of almost all bird species including songs and calls, measurements and breeding behaviour.â Over 1800 carefully-selected and edited sound recordings for over 600 species. Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.â The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen.â The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.â A \"Smart Search\" that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).â *A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device (ability to upload list coming soon)â A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or donât understand how a certain feature works.* Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep a backup from the application (My List -> Export).We invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com",

Currently a bird sighting / recording needs to be logged onsite as against  \\\"off site\\\" at a later date. We don\\'t always carry the device on which the app is installed and therefore currently unable to add / edit  later.

I expect more from such an app.  Suggestions: *) It would be great if you could flip through the \\'birds\\' (pages) with a tablet, the same as you would browse a book to look at pictures. *) If you log a sighting, to automatically use the current date, and location (using GPS) *) The screen is divided into two frames, one with the bird and one with information. It would be nice if you could compare birds with each other.",
