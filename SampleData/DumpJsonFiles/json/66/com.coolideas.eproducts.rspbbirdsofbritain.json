        "comment": "It works, has good images and recordings, but this isn\\'t an app, it\\'s a downloadable website. I can log sightings, but can\\'t click from sightings to bird descriptions or flag my favourites. There\\'s no aid to learning, it\\'s simply a catalogue, not even a \\\"bird of the day\\\". There\\'s no simple alphabetical list, and why can\\'t I search for birds by attribute?  That is, if I see a bird I don\\'t know and want to identify it, how am I supposed to?  There\\'s geographical info, but no option to filter to birds common in my current location. Why can\\'t I compare birds? Side by side images and descriptions of a crow next to a raven? The text is great, but where\\'s the simple at a glance list of attributes. Finally, the help file doesn\\'t even vaguely match the app.  The RSPB is a world leading organisation, and they deserve a better app than this.  Seriously people, pick up your game.  And if you want anyone to generate ideas for you, just get in touch. You need to build something better before someone else does.",

A good alternative to carrying the physical book. This has excellent sketches, but don\\'t expect photos.    Suggests other similar birds, and BUT DOES NOT LINK TO THEM. You have to return to the index and type the name in! How is that interactive?  Why can\\'t I search for another bird from the page of the one that has suggested that similar bird?  Compare is only the pictures, and they are NOT to scale.  My example problem comparison is winter knot and dunlin.  Unlike a book, I cannot hold open two pages and flick between them. I have to go back to the index and search again. And it does not remember what I have searched for before.   The sightings log is tortuous. I have tried to use it. For each sighting I have to search for a bird, open its page, choose to Log, pick a location (It doesn\\'t remember even if I have just logged a different bird. It has to use a pop up and then a press on the save icon, and so I cannot type and press enter), and the cursor is in the comments box so I cannot just type a few letters. Then I must pick a d",
