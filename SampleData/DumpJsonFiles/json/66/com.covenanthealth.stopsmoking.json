        "comment": "This is the type of app I was looking for - something that will step you down off dependence. Unfortunately, the app never starts correctly, always needing a restart; won\\'t keep you logged in; loses track of daily counts; clunky interface that requires several steps to input cigarette times. Excellent idea for an app, but really bad execution.",
