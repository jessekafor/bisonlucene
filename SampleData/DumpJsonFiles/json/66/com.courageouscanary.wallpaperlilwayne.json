He reached higher popularity with Tha Carter (2004), which included the single \"Go D.J.\", also appearing on Destiny's Child's top ten single \"Soldier\" that year. The album was followed by Tha Carter II (2005) and several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. Tha Carter III (2008) became Lil Wayne's most successful album to date, with first-week sales of over 1 million copies in the United States. It included the number-one single \"Lollipop\", as well as \"A Milli\" and \"Got Money\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.Lil Wayne's debut rock album, Rebirth (2010), was certified Gold despite a generally negative critical response.
