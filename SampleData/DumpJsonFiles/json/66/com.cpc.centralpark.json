        "comment": "The map & info is spot on so you can quickly know what you\\'re looking at and plan your route. It\\'s a lot better than those paper maps they sell all over the park. The app always seems to fail the first time you try to open it which is a bit annoying. Hope they add so of the geologic info of the park to the app.",

I\\'m constantly re-panning and zooming in to get back to where I was.  The map always comes up blank and takes a long time (and requires good data reception) to show again!  The regular map app can save-for-offline and naturally caches, and is far better-if only more detail and landmarks were on Google Maps.  I ended up buying a paper map in the park for $2.",
