It is attended by hundreds of specialist family law barristers and solicitors who take back to their firms and chambers the knowledge and experiences that accrue during 3 days of concentrated sessions and meetings. In addition the conference attracts judicial officers and senior staff from Australiaâs family courts, representatives of important non government organisations, and key personnel from federal government agencies and departments.NOTE: The 15th National Family Law Conference Mobile App is for attendees of the 15th National Family Law Conference only.
