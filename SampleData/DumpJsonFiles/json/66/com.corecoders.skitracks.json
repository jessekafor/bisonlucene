        "comment": "This app would have been fantastic. It has some excellent stats, and most of the time seems to just do the right thing, when left running in the background. It\\'s a shame it\\'s spoiled in a few ways:  First, it doesn\\'t use Android intents properly; want to share to Google Drive - you have to click \\'share\\', which *should* launch an intent picker, but doesn\\'t. You then have to select \\\"email\\\", and then you get the intent picker. Rather than having sharing to Facebook etc. built in, the app should just use native Android intents - if I have the Facebook app installed, use that; otherwise, don\\'t present it as an option. I presume this is an artefact of an iPhone port or something.  Second, and more critical, the app refused to start because it couldn\\'t contact a license server. I was abroad, and had a choice of incurring roaming data fees, or not using it. Not a great choice.",

There is one small bug - if you change from metric to imperial when you\\'ve paused a recording (over lunch say) then it changes the units but not the numbers.  Still, this does mean I have a screenshot showing a speed of just over 100mph, which I shall keep.  It does sort itself out when you save a day\\'s skiing so it\\'s hardly a big issue.  Gets through about 30% of my battery (S3) during the day (with phone on Airplane mode) which is good too.",

        "comment": "This app is super cool, too bad it can\\'t seem to add and subtract. It is limited by how well your GPS works, but that is no excuse for several errors. 1 - max elevation is actually recorded as 6925 on the stats page, but I have elevation data from the .kmz file that show maximum elevation data of 6968 (btw, the top of the peak I was on is 7012, so that last 44 feet can be attributed to GPS error) 2 - many (all?) of the run stats the difference between start altitude and finish altitude does not equal the difference between those two values, and is typically off by ~10% . This is not GPS error, this is application math error. All in, I logged 27843 vertical on SkiTracks, but adding up the verical rise of all the lifts I took my vertical was really 33230\\'.  Ski tracks let me follow my route on Google Earth (email your file and open in google earth) so I could track which lifts I took and how many times. So, all in a cool app, but the analysis is subject to +/- 10% error.  Next I will check how it is calculating max speed and whether it is messing that up also.",

        "comment": "After trying (and failing) to use AlpineReplay, I decided to give the Android port of Ski Tracks a try, recording my last two days in Lake Louise, and despite it being a rather young port, I\\'m quite impressed!  About my only major complaint (echoed by a friend who regularly uses the iPhone version) is that it appears to have lost track of my last run of the day, which is a shame since I broke my speed record during that run (though it did retain a record of the speed attained, there\\'s simply no record of it under the run breakdown).  Aside from that it worked great!  Barely a hit to the battery life (my Nexus 4 had ~60% after 6 hours on the mountain) and excellent tracking.  The on-device analysis and visualization is very nice (integrating with Google Maps means you also get labeled runs on supported resorts), and export to KML + Google Drive made it dead easy to view runs directly in Google Maps and Earth.  About the only other obvious thing lacking is more sharing options... what fun is tracking your ski runs if you can\\'t reach narcissism nirvana by sharing with all your uninterested friends?  Facebook and email support is there, but I\\'d love to see support for posting to G+.",
