    "description": "This is a first time android app. The idea behind this app is simple. It's simple app where if you press yes or no it will say \"yes\" or \"no\". If you have any ideas to add to this app please tell me in the comments. Have fun! Use this app to annoy some people :). I will be making some better apps in the future as I learn more.",
