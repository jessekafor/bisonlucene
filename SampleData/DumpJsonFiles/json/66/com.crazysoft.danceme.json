    "description": "-- Fantastic offer --Now the game is offered FULL VERSION for FREE with ads.CLICK HERE TO GET THE AD FREE VERSION**** pdasnews.com review: \"This is an overall smart game which has a lot of fun to offer. Trophies blast the gameplay to a new level and gives you unlimited hours until you get bored with it. Totally suggested as a family game or a difficult sync action/memory game...\" ****The game is very simple. Try clicking as fast as possible: Up, Down, Left or right keys at the bottom when matching icons appear near the triangle guy. Be careful: If you are slow or if you click the wrong key you will lose a life.â¢ Dancing moves / trophies:After you warm up the real dancing begins. There you can do special dance moves (trophies) if you know them. Each trophy will be shown if you reach the points needed. At the main menu, go to the trophies page to see how many points you need for each trophy. When the required points are gathered the trophy's icon first appears to alert you. After a while its four keys are shown to you. Hurry up and click the keys shown to activate it. If you are successful a trophy icon will appear, if not you will have to do this again when the trophy reappears.â¢ Speed bar:If you have activated at least one trophy then the speed bar (next to the life dots) will be enabled. The bar will raise depending on the speed you click the correct keys. If you are fast, it will raise fast.â¢ Foot button:When the speed bar (next to the life dots) gets full it will enable the foot button (it will light up). You can click this button anytime you wish to do a dance move (trophy) you have already learned. Click it and then click the four arrow keys of your dance move (Go to the trophy page to remember them). If you click the foot button and successfully do a trophy, you can click the foot button repeatedly and get extra points until the trophy is over.â¢ Perfect sync:If you click the foot button and stop the dancing fellow with both his foot down on the ground then you will achieve a 'perfect sync' (see sync icon on the trophy icon). This way an extra arrow icon will appear at the end of the trophy (if successful) and by clicking it you will repeat the dance move. Repeating 4 times will give you a life.â¢ Combo:A combo (that is to do another trophy right after one trophy ends) will be activated only after you do all the dance moves (trophies) you know. You must do them yourself (with the foot button). When you know many moves the combo will be repeated more than once. The trophies made while at combo count as moves for the future combos.FEATURESâ¢ Funny cartoon graphics!â¢ Amazing frenetic fast gameplay!â¢ Designed for short gaming (breaks,metro).â¢ Super addicting!â¢ Many dance moves to unlockâ¢ Export Hi-Scores to internet",
