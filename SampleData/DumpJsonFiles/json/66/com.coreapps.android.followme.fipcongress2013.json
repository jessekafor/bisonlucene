    "description": "In a constantly evolving environment, where advances in science, technology and communications require us all to adapt, it is vital that the pharmacy profession is at the forefront of change; responding to medical innovations alongside changing patient needs.  The theme of the 2013 FIP Congress - Towards a future vision for complex patients: Integrated care in a dynamic continuum - will address these developments, and the central role of the pharmacist in delivering patient care in an ever more challenging setting.Today pharmacy in Ireland is undergoing its biggest transformation thanks to legislative change to regulate the profession and expand the roles of pharmacists in Ireland. Much has changed since Dublin last hosted the Congress in 1975! It is hoped that these experiences can be shared with visiting delegates. We hope that Dublin will follow the Centennial FIP Congress in being the most important meeting place for our global network of pharmacists.",
