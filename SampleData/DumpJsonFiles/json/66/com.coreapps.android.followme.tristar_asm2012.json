        "comment": "Was quite helpful in managing my schedule for different sessions. Search function should be more stronger and customized, I should be able to search authors, participants etc. Major upgrade is needed for bookmarking, there should be a way to see my bookmarked lectures and/or posters (which belong to entirely different sessions), in my schedule, so that I can attend them as and when they happen. Currently you can only see whole sessions in my schedule link.",
