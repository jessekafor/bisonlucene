To be honest the fact it has a bulk importer and a coupon look up makes it not even really need a scanner, but each to their own.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 so I am having a hard time figuring out how to \\\"use\\\" a coupon from my phone, however I can go on the web side and make the adjustments.    With that said this app makes couponing so much easier!  I work full time and go to school (on top of being a mom of 3 active kids) so this is a life saver.  No more fumbling with a binder or having to update lists.  I know what I got within seconds so it also cuts my shopping trip because I even set up the categories to match up the ones I set up in my coupon binder.  SIMPLE!  I work in retail and recommend this app on a daily basis",
