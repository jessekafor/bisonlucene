I downloaded this app the other day tried it tonight booked my taxi earlier today using this app.  when the job has been accepted by the driver you are informed and can track the progress which puts you onto google maps in realtime display.  So easy to use can save journeys in set up.  Great job guys guess i wont be talking to you anymore lol Fantastic App",
