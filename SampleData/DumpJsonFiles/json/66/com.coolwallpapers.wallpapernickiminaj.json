Minaj's second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), topped charts internationally, also spawning the top 10 singles \"Starships\" and \"Pound the Alarm\". The album became one of the best-selling albums of 2012, according to the Nielsen SoundScan, selling one million copies worldwide,[8] as well as \"Starships\" becoming one of the best-selling singles of that year.[9] The album was reissued as Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded â The Re-Up with additional content.
