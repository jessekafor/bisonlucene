It doesnt even show you the game it just gives you a score at the end and that sucks and whenever I try to reject an offer for a player im trying to sell.nothing happens and it foesnt allow other teams to bid. This game needs major bug fixing and better gameplay. Oh and I have like 3 red cards and 3 injuries every game and that\\'s just unrealistic and annoying fix that.",

What I didn\\'t care about is first off the english isn\\'t the greatest, so it takes a min. or two to figure out certain things.  Secondly, the editor seems pointless.  I can make Pamplona the best team in the league, but I don\\'t have the option to choose it.  I tested the editor out by making Caen a normal team with huge amounts of money, but while I\\'m buying the best players around, so is everyone else.  So I\\'m still loosing every game.  In the end, I uninstalled it.  Didn\\'t seem worth it to me.  I\\'d rather play aFM lite a few times and leave it at that.",
