The extra shortcut is a massive concenience.  *TAKE NOTE HERE, DEV*  I once booted my phone to have no launcher load, and instead I was only able to get to my music app through doubletap function. This could have been potentially crippling, and I understand why other people gave this a very low rating.  The reliability of this app/mod at boot needs to be seriously increased, or else people will be practically bricking their phone if the app fails to start the default launcher.",

Slow double click does go to the app that I reprogrammed to which was Vlingo.  A quick double click goes to the default Voice Command application.  Now I\\'m going to uninstall this and hope everything goes back to normal (since I still have access to Task Manager via holding Home key).",
