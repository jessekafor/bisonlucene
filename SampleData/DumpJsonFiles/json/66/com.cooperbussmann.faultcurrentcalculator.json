    "description": "The Cooper Bussmann Available Fault Current Calculator application is an innovative tool developed for contractors, engineers, electricians, and electrical inspectors. This tool can be used on the Cooper Bussmann website or out in the field on a mobile device for those needing a quick and simple way to determine available fault current.With this simple tool, users can:- Calculate available fault current on single and three-phase systems- E-mail and print a label for marking the available fault current on service equipment (NECÂ® 110.24)- Size fuses and conductors for service, feeder, and branch circuits.This application, calculations, and other information are intended to clearly present technical information that will determine the available fault current at specific points in an electrical system.

        "comment": "This is easier to use than my electrical design software for determining fault currents. I\\'ve used the cooper bussman guide as a method for calculating fault currents before. Thanks for automating it. It even generates a PDF with all the fault currents labeled. Make it movable to the SD card and allow me to add motors and I\\'ll give it 6 stars.",
