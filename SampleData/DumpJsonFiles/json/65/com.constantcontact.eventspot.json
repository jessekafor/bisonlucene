        "comment": "There are 2 serious problems with the Android version of this app:  1) If you have more than 100 attendees, you won\\'t be able to find or scroll to all of them, 2) You can\\'t check in guests separately from the people who \\\"purchased\\\" the tickets.  For my 800 person conference in July, I had to scrounge up an iPad at the last minute to do check-ins with, and I had to use a paper printout in order to find people in the application.  Between not finding attendees because they were \\\"guests\\\", and not finding people because they weren\\'t giving me the exact name they registered under, it caused a lot of delays and stress.  I am hoping they can fix that Android bug, and give us more ways to look up folks before my conference next year!",
