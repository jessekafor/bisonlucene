    "description": "Get ready for a card game that makes all other forms of entertainment look like deadwood: AcesÂ® Gin Rummy!  The cards are dealt. You pass on the up-card and draw from the stock. Two melds already and youâve only drawn once! Sort the high cards down and discard that king. Not much deadwood, but if you knock now, you might get undercut. Itâs risky either way, but you hang in there, hoping for a spade or a seven.One more draw...and...GIN!Cast of CharactersWant to play Gin Rummy against an elegant Victorian skunk? Weâve got you covered. How about a dapper beaver in a collar and waistcoat? You can do that too. With 11 different animated characters to choose from, including a variety of well dressed ladies and gentlemen (and equally well dressed farm animals and robots), our cast of quirky characters will charm the aces out of you.Gameplay For All Skill LevelsIf youâre new to Gin Rummy, donât worry. The EASY difficulty setting is a great way to ease into the game. If youâre looking for more of a challenge, HARD will have you planning every move and really watching the discards. Whatever your skill level, our adjustable difficulty system has the right setting for you.Traditional ScoringGames in Gin Rummy can be customized to be played to 100 (if youâre looking for a quick game), 150, 250 or 300 (if youâd like a game that lasts a bit longer). Scoring follows classic rules with a 100 point bonus for winning, a 20 point bonus for each hand won, and double points for shutting out your opponent!More games from Concrete Software:PBA Bowling ChallengeAces SpadesAces HeartsWordsplosionAces Bubble PopperAces Traffic PackAces Jewel Hunt",
