        "title": "Quite good app but!",
        "comment": "This is a good app in as much as it has many up to date comps with great prizes but its a pain because once you have finished on whatever comps website and click the back button it doesnt take you back to where you were on the list so you have to aimlessly scroll down through the whole lot again, in fact, often it returns to the app itself which is so frustrating and puts you off using it. If ty can sort those problems out it would definately get 5 stars.",
