BTW, very easy to download the batch file and run it on non-rooted phones, takes < 1 min.  I wanted to take screenshots to use as a back-up to my phone settings, screen layouts, app settings, etc.  I plan to root my phone soon, so these screenshots will make it much easier to \\\"re-build\\\" my phone after rooting, and for a new phone in the future.",

ICS/JB has the ability to capture screenshots, but I didn\\'t want to have to open them up in another app or shoot them off to my desktop to make notes. Also the shake to screenshot feature is a lot easier than the awkward power + volume down combo if you need to capture something in a hurry. Overall very useful.",
