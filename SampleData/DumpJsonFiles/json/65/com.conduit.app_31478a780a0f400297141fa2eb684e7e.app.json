    "description": "The Sales Metrics That Matter App focuses on the Banking Industry, specifically focusing on developing the next generation of sales intelligence, the metrics that matter and performance management. In 2003, I initiated a seminal research project in which I continuously monitored the sales progression of 370 banks: including approximately 10,000 retail branches and over 3,000 business/commercial bankers. The resulting data culminated in an unprecedented analysis of best-in-class organizations and top business bankers. These findings, bringing insights never before collected for the financial industry, have allowed me to clearly define what the highest performing organizations and individuals do differently to maximize the customer experience and to optimize revenues and shareholder value. The Sales Metrics That Matter App has been launched to provide you easier connectivity to our intellectual material and to our team of high performance trainers.",
