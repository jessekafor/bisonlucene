    "description": "Tupac Amaru Shakur (1971-1996) - Tupac Shakur was undoubtedly the biggest influence on the Hip Hop / Rap Community. In his early record days Tupac talked about peace, changing the world, education, living in a white mans world and putting his views on the world and life as he saw it. Through the years and throughout his trials as an Artist/Performer he was shot, framed, lied about, and as a result his music went from peace keeping and changing the world to an all out assault against all the haters and would be thugs that always came his way. As a believer in living by the gun and dieing by the gun Tupac often predicted his death and since one of his favorite people in history was NiccolÃ² di Bernardo dei Machiavell the Italian historian, diplomat, and philosopher who had faked his own death, people thought Tupac was setting up for the same kind of act. On September 7, 1996, the world was shocked to hear that Tupac Shakur was shot in an apparent drive-by in Las Vegas. Five days later, Tupac was pronounced dead. After his death, many questions have been raised about whether or not Tupac was really shot. To this day, many believe the questions remain unanswered. What Tupac did leave answered is in his lyrics, quotes, and interviews. Tupac was a man on a mission and his mission was to leave a legacy and that he did. There were more albums put out after his death than what he had put out when he was alive. Tupac was way beyond his years putting down a flow that is unmatchable, distinct, and one that will forever change the world. Tupac died like lived and will forever be forgotten. This app is dedicated to some real soliders I gotta shout out. First and foremost my soul mate and my life Nicole and to our precious boys Jayden, Cayden, Suge and Beau and to some real street solidiers and my closest road dogz Chael Sonnen, Jose M., IImachavelli and the warriors of Team Quest. Most of all this is for ya'all. Remember to Keep it Real...Until the end of time. ~Boss",
