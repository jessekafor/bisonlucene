You can then easily access and control your settings. Also GPS-Mate has a setting to keep the screen on when it is running in the foreground.

        "comment": "Had hopes. Wanted a GPS app with a PC counterpart. This ain\\'t it. Confused UI. Never could figure out how to do much with the app. PC program, once I figured out how to get it into english, still never worked. Only map displayed, despite selecting others, was Munich. App and PC program were useless for me.",
