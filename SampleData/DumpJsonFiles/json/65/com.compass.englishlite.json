Although there are a lot of Feng Shui books, but most of the readers feel difficult in understanding and learning how to use Feng Shui Compass to measure the household azimuth. Since the smartphone contains embedded electronic compass, and we knew that Feng Shui  \"Qi\" theory can be achieve by a computer program, so we started to design a smart Feng Shui  compass application since 2009 on the smartphone platform in order to measure the azimuth of the main door and provide analysis of the good or bad of residential/office location by artificial intelligence of the computer program, and the software based on the Feng Shui  theory can provide the Feng Shui  layout recommendations to the users.Basic principle: There are two versions, which are the \"Basic Editionâ, and \"Professional: â¢ \"Basic Edition\" provides only general \"home\" and \"office\" Feng Shui  analysis and layout recommendations, suitable for house owner, residential leaseholder and while-collar worker.
