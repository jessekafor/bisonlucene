With over 80,000 drivers in its rosters, the NHRA is one of the largest motorsports sanctioning bodies in the world.The association was founded by Wally Parks in 1951 in the State of California to provide a governing body to organize and promote the sport of drag racing. The first nationwide NHRA sponsored event was held in 1955, in Great Bend, Kansas. (Typical for the era, this race was held on a World War II-constructed training air field.) The national event series (the \"Nationals\"), which now comprise 22 events each year, are the premier events in drag racing that bring together the best cars and drivers from across North America. The Mac Tools U.S. Nationals are now held at Indianapolis Raceway Park in Clermont, Indiana and are officially called the Mac Tools U.S. Nationals. Winners of national events are awarded a trophy statue in honor of founder Wally Parks. The trophy is commonly referred to by its nickname, a âWallyâ.Contents 2009 Top Fuel trophyNHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series - The Top Division of the NHRA. It consists of four professional classes.Top Fuel DragsterFunny CarPro StockPro Stock Motorcycle.[edit]Sportsman classesThere are more than a dozen Sportsman Classes. The classes contested at NHRA Divisional races include Snowmobile, Motorcycle Classes, Super Street, Super Gas, Stock Eliminator, Super Stock, Competition Eliminator, Super Comp, Top Sportsman, Top Dragster, Top Alcohol Funny Car and Top Alcohol Dragster. All classes except Snowmobile and some Sportsman Motorcycle classes are regularly contested at NHRA National Events. NHRA promotes mainly the Professional Classes at National Events, however, the majority of its participants are Sportsman Racers. Sportsman Class Racers must be dues-paying members of NHRA before they are allowed to enter and participate in any NHRA event. NHRA claims to have 80,000 members, of which 95% are non-professional. NHRA uses this figure of 80,000 members on promotional materials and on its website to market its services. Indeed Sportsman Classes fueled the birth of NHRA in 1951 and continue to be the backbone of Drag Racing.[citation needed] As per the official NHRA Rulebook, NHRA.com, HD Partners documentation, PSTA vs. NHRA documents. Included in these sportsman events are the Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series, The Summit Racing Equipment Racing Series and the NHRA Jr. Drag Racing League.NASCAR, Racing, TV, Cars, Rides, Fast,",
