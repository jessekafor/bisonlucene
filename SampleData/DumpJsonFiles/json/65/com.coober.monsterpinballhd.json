        "comment": "I like the game a lot but there are some things which prevent it from being a 5 star. Most importantly there are bugs. Sometimes the ball gets stuck and there is no way of getting it back. The only exception I found was when the ball is hovering above the upper exit of the center tube it is possible to recover it by changing the games speed back and forth. Please make a shake button like most other pinball games. Also I\\'d like to have the possibility to change the starting table.",

        "comment": "Matmi is a developer that understands what makes pinball fun: the noise, the spectacle, and ball physics you can trust.  You can set the speed to learn the tables, and turn off the music to play your own.  All six tables are slick, fast, fun and sound fantastic.  Above all however, the game doesn\\'t need to cheat with questionable physics to overcome poor table design.  Monster Pinball is very different, and a ton of silly fun.",
