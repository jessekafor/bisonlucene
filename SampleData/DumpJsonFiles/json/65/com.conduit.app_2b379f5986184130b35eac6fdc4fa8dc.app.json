    "description": "Simply Surreal is a custom art and design studio with a purpose.  As we are called to use our gifts and talents to glorify God, we see it as our responsibility and great great privilege to be able to create art that reflects God's grace.     The mediums used at Simply Surreal are wide spread, and always expanding.  Graced with creativity, the artists are constantly finding new ways to create something out of nothing. (which is exactly what God has done with us through Jesus)   Although Simply Surreal is currently established as an LLC, no profits are taken from it's earnings.  Every penny thus far has been going right back into the studio; creating a gallery/lounge area for future outreach events.  With this faze looking to be complete by mid 2013, all earnings from then on will go directly to the missions field.   We welcome you, and hope you enjoy.In His perfect Love,-Donald Clarksinner saved",
