    "description": "Why do they call him MrStinky? Because he's truly the shit. Dissect the lyrics that he spit, the world will never forget. His looks, his energy, his talent; he is a reggae/rap star. Now it's your job to find out why his name is ringing like this. He is not new to this but very true to this. He has shared the stage with Tech N9ne, E-40, Fabolous, Ice Cube, Da Brat, Youngbloodz, Tupac's Outlaws, the late Mac Dre, and Too Short just to name a few. He seems to be two different people in one with reality rap songs and authentic dance hall reggae. It's unbelievable and has never been duplicated. That's what makes him different from any other artist on earth.",
