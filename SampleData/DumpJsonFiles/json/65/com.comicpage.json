    "description": "The Funny Page (TFP) indulges your need for both entertainment and simplicity by serving up your favorite web comics into one easy-to-use, scrollable page. With The Funny Page, all of the latest comics are at your finger tips the moment they're released. By pulling the RSS feed from web comic websites, the Funny Pages is able to collect all the latest comic images and information. Choose from a list of over 20 pre-supported comics (including xkcd and The Draw Play), or enter the RSS information for a new one. It's the only web comic reader where you get to make your own comic page!The application supports most web comics that utilize an RSS feed with a link to the image or thumbnail of the comic. Touch one of the comics on your main screen and it will open the single-comic view, where you can pan and zoom on the comic, view the next or previous comic in the series, and read both the full title text and alternate image text. If the comic includes a link to the web page, you will see a link icon beside the comic's title. Clicking the title of web-linked comics will take you directly to the author's site, in your device's browser. The Funny Page is carefully built to provide you with the fastest and most optimized viewing system. Upon first viewing a comic, the application will store the image in memory for faster loading and minimized data usage. In this way and many other ways, The Funny Page is designed with the avid comic-viewer in mind.If there is a comic that lists the image link in the RSS feed that doesn't work, send me a link to it and I'll see if I can get it working in the next release. If you find a comic that works, but isn't in the supported list, send it along to me and I'll add it to the supported list. If you find any other issues let me know and I'll do my best to fix them!",
