    "description": "Hey guys, we are \"The Dance Floor Massacre\"! We are a music duo group from Buffalo, New York. The members are Tyler, and Raymond. We are just trying to get out there, and get noticed a bit, so we need YOU guysto try and help us out!Please help support us, listen to our music, share us, like us on Facebook, follow us on twitter, and Tumblr too!:D Genre: Our genre is pretty different from other musicians. Y'know how most musicians do like only one genre such as Rap, Electronica, Rock, etc? Well we decided to to try something new, and different by combining different genres together. We combined Dance, Techno, Rap, and Post-Hardcore into dance music, like Techno, Electronica, Dubstep, Trance, Rap, pretty much dance music, thus \"Dance Floor Massacre\" was created! Were going to do the best we can to make you guys happy, and to continue making amazing music for you guys!!:)",
