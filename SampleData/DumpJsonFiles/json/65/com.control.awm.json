        "comment": "May be a decent app.  Sectionals are nice.  The interface is not intuative to a 10yr Garmin user.  Biggest problem is there is apparently no terrain data for Alaska, and it gets confused by the P instead of K in the airport identifier.  I cant just plug in PAFA for Fairbanks and flight plan for it.  Glad i got it for the 49.99 special price instead of full price.  It took too long to download the data to know I would not have all the features to retun it.",
