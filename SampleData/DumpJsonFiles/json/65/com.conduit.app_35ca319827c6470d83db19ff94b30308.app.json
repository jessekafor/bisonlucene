    "description": "Single Seat allows you to get involved in the Europe-wide campaign to end the European Parliament's two-seat arrangement between Brussels and Strasbourg - costing EU taxpayers an estimated â¬180 million and 19,000 of CO2 every year. Members (MEPs) of the European Parliament and Parliament staff overwhelmingly want one seat, as do the 1.27 million European citizens who signed the One Seat petition for one working location in Brussels. As the campaign gathers momentum, keep up to date with how Members are continuously voting for a Single Seat, who the campaign's latest public supporters are, and how you yourself can get involved.Single Seat allows you immediate access to all of the campaign's latest photos, videos and social media and gives you a chance to share your own. The Single Seat campaign is co-chaired by European Parliament Vice-Presidents Edward McMillan-Scott (Liberal Democrat, UK) and Alexander Alvaro (Germany, FDP) and a steering committee of senior MEPs.Join the campaign for a more democratic, green and cost-effective European Parliament, join Single Seat!",
