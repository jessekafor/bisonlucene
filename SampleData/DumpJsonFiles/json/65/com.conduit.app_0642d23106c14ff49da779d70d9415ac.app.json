    "description": "The Friends of Israel (WA) Inc (FOIWA) enables Western Australians to take a stand for democratic values and freedoms  by supporting Israel, a champion of those values in the Middle East; and a nation on the front lines of the global battle between those who love life and those who glorify death.Visit this web app to stay informed of events in the Middle East, find in-depth analysis, opinion and magazine articles, and be aware of the activities of FOIWA.Join us and identify with the many Western Australians who arenât fooled by the relentless propaganda campaign by Israelâs enemies to vilify her, undermine her legitimacy, and ultimately destroy the only homeland of the Jewish people.We donât need to agree on everything. We respect diversity, but we all believe in democracy, freedom, respect for life and that Israel deserves our support.Please check out our web site also at www.foiwa.org.au and Join Us ....",
