Place two or more Special Gravitons, and enjoy the blast.âââ THIS IS NO TETRINOMINO âââSlideToPlay.com says \"ââ¦ it does offer a unique twist on this familiar concept.âAppAdvice.com \"ââ¦ is a game of Tetris like you havenât seen beforeâMicrosiervos.com \"âsomething more than a Tetris adapted to XXI centuryââââ THREE GAME MODES âââEasy it's free and will help you get 'use to' the mechanics.Alpha it's the beggining of the challenge. Harder Pieces, less time and full Graviton ForceOmega. It's the 'puzzling' mode. Pieces can escape Gravitons as long as they have enough mass. The time it's really short and you need to think. The mode for the Brain-Additcs.âââ HOW TO PLAY âââAs simple as drag & dropâ¦- Drag & Drop a piece. The laser guides will show where the piece will drop.â¨- If your piece falls on a positive or negative gravimetric area, it will be push or attracted.â¨- Arrange the pieces in blocks of 3x3.â¨- After a pulse (time) ends a new particle will appear on a capsule.â¨- Press on the empty capsules to get a new piece.â¨- Beware, if at the end of the pulse all the capsules are full, the alarm will activate.â¨- If the alarm itâs running after the pulse ends, contention matter that will push your pieces up.â¨- Keep doing blocks of 3x3 after every pulse and gain score multipliers. Try to get the maximum!â¨- Pieces will keep getting harder and harder to sort as the levels go up. Keep focus to get to the higher levels.â¨- If one particle touch the pieces launch area, then is game overâ¦âââ YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER âââWe are a small Indie game company and we are always listening.
