It has the ability to jump, double jump and attack, and it can do all these things at the same time while rolling, rolling and rolling! Well, actually its secret ability is to continue to roll without getting a severe headache... :)Moreover Goomy has the ability to change its form: even though we weren't able to identify its nature, so far we know that there are at least nine different forms of this strange creature! Try to get'em all!Where is Goomy going?Although we have no certainty, ancient legends tell us of a mysterious Rainbow Land where little round cretures will find their happiness, but unforeseen dangers await those who dares to reach it...
