    "description": "Conscience+ is a new Decision Making Aidâ¢ designed by psychologist and behavioral economist Dan Ariely, bestselling author of Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, and the soon to be released The Honest Truth about Dishonesty.Conscience+ is here to help you through lifeâs most perplexing moral dilemmas. Based on the latest insights about human decision making, Conscience+ gives you the excuses you need to justify doing what you want to do -- whether it is something good you aspire to, OR something more shady and less moral. Think of Conscience+ as providing both an angel and a devil, sitting on your shoulder and available for advice at the flip of a switch.Conscience+ helps with:- turning away the dessert menu - splurging on a new electronic gadget- staying faithful to your romantic partner- padding your expense report on your bossâs dime- lying on your college application- and much, much more!Disclaimer: We donât really want you to make immoral decisions, so please limit your use of Conscience+ in justifying bad behavior.",
