        "comment": "Great game if you like word games. Quick play can get kind of addictive when trying to go uo the belt levels. Didn\\'t understand how that worked at first but figured it out after a few plays. You have to get three higher belts than the one you\\'re at to go up to the next belt. The play can be sliw at first but picks up as you go up the levels. Different take on the average word game. Overall very fun game.",
