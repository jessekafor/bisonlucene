    "description": "Welcome! A few years ago, I set out to create a perfect platforming engine. If you've played a Sonic game, or FancyPants, you'll have an idea of what I mean. I call it 'Momentum Platforming.'This technically is the fourth game in the series, and I'm attempting to bring all three of the previous storylines together in a whole new rewritten engine for GameMaker: Studio.Why should you give this game a try?A mix of a super smooth platforming, parkour experience and a laugh-inducing storyline, will keep you playing for whole minutes! -Until the end of the current demo.This is still a very very early demo, but I wanted to get it out to be able to get some feedback on its roots.General controls are stated in the first room of the demo, and there's a nice selection of places to play around in for now.Give it a try, and let me know what you think of it!Thanks,ChrisExtra Media:These will give you a good idea of what you'll find here.YouTube Playlist of Demo Videos of this:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL2H4-Mxh2h_OaOuX-7u32hnCIGwH6dQgDemo Video of \"Suh Burb\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxX88KJ9exYDemo Video of \"Suh Burb 2\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMC0Eebk4E",
