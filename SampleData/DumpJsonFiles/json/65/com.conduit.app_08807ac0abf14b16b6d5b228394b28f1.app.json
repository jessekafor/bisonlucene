    "description": "Without exception every KSpin Designs garment is made by hand with precision here in the United States either by Kerry Lynn herself, or one of KSpin Designs expert seamstresses.With that said there is another, philanthropic side to KSpin Designs that is just as important as the clothing itself. As a successful businesswoman at the height of her modeling career, 27 year old Kerry Lynn was diagnosed with Melanoma. Ultimately she was successful in beating it, but the experience left her forever changed.Kerry Lynn created KSpin with a dual purpose in mind; the second purpose being to educate children on the importance of protecting themselves from the disease. The frustrating dichotomy of skin cancer is that although it's one of the most destructive forms of the affliction, it's also one of the easiest to prevent. Early prevention education is paramount in helping children avoid it, and could easily save their lives.",
