I have purchased two of this app cause I needed it on two different phones and both phones have the app installed on on the phone memory and not a SD card like the tip says to do but it still only sends the outgoing SMS messages. Also after putting in my password and the app opens to turn it on or off but there is no way to get back into the set up menu to change our options, I have to uninstall and reinstall it just to change something.   Can someone please tell me when these things will be fixed? Or how to fix them? I have emailed the company weeks ago and have heard nothing back about it as of today.",
