    "description": "The INDIECAN ENTERTAINMENT app brings one of Canada's finest Independent Film Distributors to your smartphone and tablet. Find out more about us and discover some of the film projects we are currently involved in. The next one could be yours!INDIECAN ENTERTAINMENT will focus on Canadian independent, low-budget less than $1.25 million films. As a distributor Avi Federgreen plans to follow the same principle he has as a filmmaker; bringing Canadians films they want to watch. To INDIECAN ENTERTAINMENT Avi Federgreen brings the advantage of being a filmmaker who knows what it takes to make a film and he can help filmmakers identify their audiences and reach them.Now, in the digital age, more has to be done through social media, the Internet, and other means; the traditional route alone doesnât cut it anymore, but films have new opportunities to find audiences with TV, Netflix, and iTunes, for example, and by using websites, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media to promote and market. While recognizing the potential of new media for film releases, Federgreen also looks forward to bringing back a taste of the old days when there were events for theatrical releases, such as contests for movie goers that got people into the cinemas.Federgreen is definitely up to the challenge and believes enough in Canadian talent and Canadian storytelling to put INDIECAN ENTERTAINMENT and more Canadian indie films in the race.Avi Federgreen has been making films for almost 20 years: One Week, Score: A Hockey Musical, Im Yours, Moon Point, High Life, Hungry Hills, and many more. Itâs what he has wanted to do since he was nine years old. It is a dream achieved that is still coming true, and his work has received widespread recognition at national film festivals, including the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival, and with nominations for a Gemini and the Directors Guild of Canada awards.",
