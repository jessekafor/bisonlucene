    "description": "**ROOT REQUIRED** **Overclockable Kernel required**Now requests write external storage permission becuase of updated ad sdk.  It is needed by the ad sdk to play video ads which I DO NOT use but it had to be added so I could update my ad provider.  I made the banner ads smaller for higher resolution devices in this update to try to make them less intrusive for the user.If it doesn't hold the speeds you set it at double check to make sure you have installed an overclockable kernel.MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL DEVICES YET. CPU Boost Lite is a cpu settings app.  You can set cpu speeds and governor.  There are different profiles to use and also a widget that displays the current overclock settings.*Nitrous button widget(I don't always run my phone at the max speed that it can handle but occasionally I need that extra speed burst for an intensive app.  The nitrous button widget allows you to set that higher max speed and then just one push of the nitrous button widget from your home screen gives you that extra speed when you need it.  Push the button again to go back to your regular max speed.  All without needing to open the app.)*Battery Temp Profile*Battery Level Profile*Screen on/off Profile*Set at boot option(Please test speed settings before setting at boot or phone may not reboot)**Thanks to all who have reported back and done testing on multiple devices***If you have time to report what devices and roms you have tried with success or failure please send me an email. Thanks**Questions and suggestions always welcome*tags: cpu overclock setcpu underclock root init2winit",

        "comment": "I have an Optimus T from T-Mobile and it works just fine. Have it overclocked when the screen is on, and super clocked when running apps using the nitrous button.     Pros:  Works very fast when in use.  The CPU is fully customizable.  Works on my phone. (Most others don\\'t.)    Cons:  Needs some work with the graphics and customization of buttons.  Slow to respond when changing clock speeds.  If you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing it\\'s extremely confusing.  Needs disclaimer for education before use.      Only reason I give four stars instead of 5 is lack of functionality and confusion when setting clocks for different things. i.e.: Advanced Settings> Battery Temp profile. Does it over ride your screen profile or nitrous profile? It doesn\\'t state.",
