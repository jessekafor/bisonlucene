    "description": "CTE TEACH is a professional development program specifically designed for new and veteran career technical education teachers to provide training and professional development. CTE TEACH uses three strategies to support both new and veteran teachers: 1.an on-line early orientation program, 2. an on-line professional development program, 3. and a teacher induction and professional development program. The program is aligned with the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and the competencies addressed are those described in the document, Californiaâs Teaching Performance Expectations. A grant to Colton-Redlands-Yucaipa ROP (CRY-ROP) provides the program at no cost to participants.",
