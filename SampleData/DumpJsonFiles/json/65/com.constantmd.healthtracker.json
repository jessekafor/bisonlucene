        "comment": "I like this app very much. Its free - it has everything I need. It has lots of module to use and manage my data. I can also disable modules that I don\\'t need. Module includes Medication, Allergies, Medical Problems, Vitals, Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Pulse, Lab results (I can add any test I want), Radiology, Insurance,  Doctor Appointments and so on.   This is a highly configurable app. I would like to request the developer to develop some features for reporting. Other than its a perfect app to manage your health and medical records.   Very user friendly. Data is stored on their server, so I don\\'t have to worry about my phone being lost or damaged. I can log in from any smart phone or tablet or laptops.",
