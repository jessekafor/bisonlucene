I also like the fact that you can keep track of your \\\"hits\\\" and a \\\"putts\\\" separately. The reason I gave it 4/5 is because the gps function is buggy. Its a little bit of a pain to manually turn off gps location in your phone\\'s settings. I wish the app had an option to turn off gps (just for the app, not for the whole phone). Also, when I closed the app my gps continued to run in the background, draining my batteries. I tried to turn gps off/on in my phone settings but this did not fix it. I had to reboot my phone for it to fix itself. Great app minus the gps bug I experienced.",
