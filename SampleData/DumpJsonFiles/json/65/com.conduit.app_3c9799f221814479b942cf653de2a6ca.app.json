    "description": "LibreOffice is community-driven and developed software which is a project of the not-for-profit organization, The Document Foundation.The LibreOffice software is developed by users, just like you, who believe in the principles of free software and in sharing their work with the world in a non-restrictive way. At the core of these principles is the promise of better-quality, highly-reliable and secure software that gives you greater flexibility at zero cost. Beyond this, the driving factor behind the community is personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility and no end-user lock-in to using just one product.The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to develop the software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development exceeding expectations and, best of all, you can be part of it in a multitude of ways.The Community Bylaws, developed by our own community members, guide the way we work, and encourage new members to contribute in a way which benefits the whole community as well as themselves, while protecting your rights as a developer under the free software Lesser GNU Public v3 license. To see who has already contributed to the LibreOffice project, please visit our credits page. Will we see your name there soon?Our Privacy Policy is available for reading if you are interested how the community protects your rights, and our legal information is publicly available in order to ensure transparency within our organization.",
