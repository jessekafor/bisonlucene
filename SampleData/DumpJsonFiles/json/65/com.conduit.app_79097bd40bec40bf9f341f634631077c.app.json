    "description": "Adam Eason - Clinical Hypnotherapist introduces this app to help you lose weight:-Do you remember those daysâ¦Think back to when you were a child and you seemed to be able to eat whatever you liked and you just stayed leanâ¦Imagine feeling that way again in the future.Since you are reading this page right now, I am going to assume that you are well aware of the implications of excessive weight. But Iâm sure youâre also aware that knowing about the problem and dealing with it are often two very different propositions, arenât they?Let me ask you a question:Would You Like To Shift That Spare Tyre, Permanently?Well, now you canâ¦ But first you most likely have some emotional ties to remove.As you continue to move down this page, I want you to know that eating habits are often deeply embedded within our unconscious minds, cultivated from years of âprogrammingâ.Of course you know that you eat to celebrate, commiserate, and you associate eating with so many different aspects of your life.Did your Mum ever say to you; âFinish your dinner, there are people starving in the world!â?Did you ever get told that as a child? I know I did.How much of an effect do you think attitudes like this have on a young mind?Soon youâll sense that so much of this early programming has been what has led you to where you are today.This is just one tiny example of the many ways that we are influenced from birth to create associations to food and develop emotional ties to it.You can start removing that baggage NOW!Today, you can reprogram your unconscious associations with food for REAL effective weight control!Think about how youâre going to feel when you finally take control of your size, shape and weight in the future.Are you going to feel healthier, fitter, will you be less susceptible to illness and more susceptible to a sense of increasing well-being?Will you feel more attractive, more confident and more in control as your overall quality of life rockets into the sky?Just as important, what about the impact on others close to you?â¦Of course everyone knows that you are going to please your family, friends and colleagues, when they see you allowing yourself a longer, healthier life and being good to that person they love; that person is you.Feels good when you think about it like that, doesnât it?The best thing for now is to realise that you do actually have the potential and can make a choice to make this happen.As you think about what you are reading here today, know that only you can take the necessary steps to improve your life now â maybe you just need a little bit of a helping hand.Thatâs where this âThink Yourself Thinâ audio programme comes in â as your guide, motivation, support and success coach.    FACT    87% of people that followed this âThink Yourself Thinâ programme fully have lost more weight than they believed possible after the first month!Here is just a small sample of what this multi-session audio programme delivers:-A 100% original method of how to achieve your ideal size, weight and shape.-Clearly explained techniques on how to feel more energetic, more mobile, more agile, able to bring motion into your life with zest and vigour.-Fits your budget as it saves you money â lots of it!-You wonât be paying to put those extra pounds on your waist.-Instant results for waving goodbye to cravings.-The closely guarded secrets of naturally thin people â people who never seem to put on an ounce, no matter what they eat.-Revealing methods to increase your confidence and self-esteem.-A huge collection of ways to feel more attractive and desirable.-Step by step instructions to finally be guilt-free â no more feeling bad about yourself after eating.-The most up to date ways to feel so much healthier.-Accelerate your brain power to reframe past experiences (so itâll feel like youâve ALWAYS been in control of your weight!).",
