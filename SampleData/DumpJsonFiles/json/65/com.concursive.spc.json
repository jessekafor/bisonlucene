    "description": "This powerful mobile app helps you find all the best Official and UnOfficial parties surrounding the South By Southwest Interactive, Music, Film, and Comedy festival. With this app you can find nearby events on the interactive map, see where other users are âchecking inâ, and read live user feedback on each event. Each event description tells you if you need a badge, if they are serving food/booze, and to whom the event is targeted. Find yourself at a great party or networking event? Take pictures or make comments and share them with the rest of the community. Found an event with tons of free food and liquor, and no one to consume it? Tell the world! This is the most up-to-date resource for party info because updates come directly from you, and are pushed out by our Austin-based team of professional schmoozers and boozers. We will be using your feedback to make sure our event information is relevant, helpful, and way more awesomer than anything else out there. The Party Mapp was designed in Austin by MakeRacket. We build Private, Integrated, Social, Mobile communities for businesses, non-profits, social organizations, and all kinds of communities. We use rock-solid technology from Concursive Corporation. Together, we conceived, designed, built, and submitted this app. Please note that \"SXSW\" and \"South By Southwest\" are registered trademarks of SXSW Inc. and that this app is not endorsed by SXSW, Inc.",
