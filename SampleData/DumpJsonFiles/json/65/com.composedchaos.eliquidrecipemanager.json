    "description": "The eLiquid Recipe Manager allows e-cigarette users to formulate and view recipes to create their own eLiquid mixes for use in their e-cigarette devices.Create/Edit/Delete individual ingredients (Nicotine/Flavors/Fillers)Create/Edit/Delete complete eLiquid recipesBuilt-in Help/FAQ assists in using the application and mixing your own eLiquid for the first timeSupports PG/VG blends in both Nicotine bases and predefined fillersSet Drops Per ML setting globally or per each individual ingredientVoltage/Wattage Calculator for Variable Voltage/Wattage users (Pro version only)Ad Free (Pro version only)The recipe engine has two modes: Ratio and Premixed Filler.  Some users just want to make a recipe that's a ratio of PG and VG (80/20, 50/50, etc), for that you just have to set the preferred ratio without adding any filler ingredients to the recipe.  It supports 100% PG to 100% VG for the ratio.  The engine will calculate your results based on the desired ratio.  Other users create a premixed filler blend or just use straight PG or VG, the recipe engine allows you to add one filler ingredient and utilize it as the primary filler for the recipe.  These were the two most common scenarios asked for by users of the app.  Coming Soon:Send recipe to email recipient (Pro version only)Import/Export recipe data to Google Drive (Pro version only)Add amperage and anticipated battery life calculators (Pro version only)Vaping Information/Media site linksFeatured Suppliers sectionMuch, much more....If you have any questions about how the application works that the Help/FAQ section does not address, feel free to email me at ivisi@composed-chaos.com or on Twitter (@ComposedChaos) prior to leaving a bad review, as some of the reviews lately have been misinformed.  I don't mind a bad review if it's warranted (in those cases, I've earned those bad reviews), but if you just aren't finding what you think the app is supposed to do, ask me first before tarnishing my reputation, please.",

The feature that allows you to select a nicotine base that has a varying mix of PG and VG is very handy and missing from another app I tried.",

Once this is added I will be upgrading to pro as I already use this app as my only mixing app after try loads of them. Also needs to stop phone sleeping very annoying the screen going black. EDIT. sorted screen going off doing what you said, given 4 stars till update on water.",

Also love the built in help section.  I wish more apps had something like that.

Hopefully others will also support the creator of this fine app.",
