        "comment": "Background, I had been using Kindle Free time as a means to control and monitor my sons tablet use. I have specific needs, but I think they are not uncommon needs. I want my son to be able to have unlimited access to some apps (e.g.Kindle reader and a variety of chess apps) while limiting access and/or time to other apps. Kindle free time allows for unlimited reading but you can\\'t divide the apps into separate categories. This program seems to do all of that. The dev has been very responsive to suggestions and this app has allowed me to feel better about my son\\'s screen time.",

        "comment": "LockOut keeps kids safe while playing electronic games by allowing the parent to select which apps the child has access to and how much time the child can play.  The best part?  Kids have to use \\'study\\' apps for a parent designated amount time BEFORE they can play the fun apps.  A pin keeps kids from being able to escape from the program or getting into apps they aren\\'t supposed to.  Parents can also view reports of how long the child used each app. Safety, Education and Fun all in one app! Win/Win.",

        "comment": "I love the general idea behind this app, but it doesn\\'t stop an app when time is up unless the child goes back to the home screen.  For example, I\\'ve got my son set up to do 15 min in study apps, then 15 min in fun apps, but he can stay in a single fun app for an hour.  As long as he doesn\\'t go back to the home screen, he can continue well past his 15 minutes.  Fix this issue and it will be a 5 star app.",
