    "description": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for PTA students, recent PTA graduates, and licensed PTAs. The academic content is organized into ten unique system and non-system categories. Musculoskeletal System Neuromuscular System Cardiopulmonary System Integumentary System Other Systems Equipment and Devices Therapeutic Modalities Safety and Professional Roles Teaching and Learning Evidence-Based Practice Therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system categories or elect to review content in a random mode. Frequent review of essential academic content allows therapists to successfully convert the information to long term memory. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a therapists mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Therapists can elect to take examinations in a specific category (e.g., musculoskeletal system) or in a random mode. A formal score report describes a therapistâs level of mastery in each of the ten system and non-system categories.

        "comment": "I was pleasantly surprised to see the app updating, and to see the addition of pictures to some cards.  This is a step in the right direction, but many of the pictures failed to load properly, and the layout of some of the navigational screens has been distorted.  Please try again Scorebuilders, as these most recent updates are still appreciated.",

        "comment": "I really would like to love this app - it contains a LOT of great information invaluable for the PTAExam & the tests are nice, too BUT I paid for this app as a tool to help me pass this year\\'s PTA exam, only to find out it hasn\\'t been updated in 2 years. Also, the text-only format makes it hard to visualize concepts & the tiny font and inability to flip the screen to landscape makes it really hard to read. Please update it asap - the exam is July 10th & I\\'d like to say it was worth paying $30 for.",
