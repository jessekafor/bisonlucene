Everything is set so that my work PC is the primary and basically everything goes downward from there to minimize duplications etc.  Well, This FABULOUS software has now basically taken all 600+ of my contacts, thrown them up in the air and left information wherever it wants.  I have addresses where I had no address before.  I have phone number that have been moved.  I have notes that have been copied across numerous contacts.  Short, it is an absolute nightmare.  To make things better I attempted to email customer service.  5 days later and NO response.  Shocker!!  I have to say thanks to DejaOffice and Companionlink for completely destroying a contact list and tons of information that has taken years to buidl.  Stay away.",

This is a long running (year +) problem and I can no longer rely on it. The workarounds from the vendor are pretty lame -- look in Outlook deleted items for what it has dumped, put them back, and re-sync, but that\\'s not the end as it refuses to read the restored entries.  The second workaround is to then force deletion of everything on my Galaxy S2 at the next sync, and then check again in the Outlook deleted items. If you get the idea this never ends -- you\\'ve got it! Impressed -- not.",

        "comment": "It is junk. been trying to get it to work for about 2 years. Tech support never solve the problems. they consistently give the runaround. the program is very unreliable and this is using it as a 1 way sync from my computer to my phone. it has and always have had major issues. The very bad thing is that no one else offers a solution that\\'s better. this is the best software out there for us ACT power users that need to get contacts and field data to our smartphone. I\\'m stuck between a rock and a hard spot.",

        "comment": "In order to sync DO with MS Office you must use CompanionLink on your PC.  For several years I have suffered intermittent loss of records (mostly contacts.). I have had to go through time consuming \\'fixes\\', mostly per CL support, which never solved the problems.  I still find records on my phone that are missing from my PC and CL just tells me that it is a problem with MS.  I\\'ll be dropping both DO and CL soon.",
