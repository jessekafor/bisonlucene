However, if someone doesnt know a word even after hints and many trials, the game doesnt give you a chance to quit trying so that it gives you the word and you move to the next. Please include that option, other than that u did a great job!!!!",

Words are simple to start with, but as you keep going, less common and more interesting words appear. This is a great game!",
