    "description": "The 1-800 CONTACTS app is the fastest, easiest and most enjoyable way to order contact lenses in the solar system. Where else can you reorder your contacts in 3 taps? Pluto? PLUTO ISNâT EVEN A PLANET ANYMORE. SIMPLE ORDERING Ordering for the first time? Itâs slightly more than 3 taps, but itâs still simple and quick and weâll walk you through the whole process like a scout helping an old lady cross the street, except not in a patronizing way because thatâs rude. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS? WE HAVE ANSWERS In addition to your contacts youâre getting a whole lotta service. Friendly service, at that. If you ever have any questions you can call, email, or text us right from the app. We answer calls in 30 seconds, respond to emails in 15 minutes, and texts in 4 minutes - all by real live people with adorable Utah accents (NOTE: you only get the adorable accent if you call). LENSGAUGE FOR EVERYONE Perhaps you arenât a 1-800 CONTACTS customer yet. Itâs OK. We arenât here to judge. Our LensGauge feature can be used by anybody to be reminded of when itâs time to swap out their lenses. Because nobody likes itchy red eyes. Nobody. FEATURES GALORE â¢ Scan your contact lens box to upload your prescription â no typing required. â¢ Upload a pic of your paper prescription and weâll ship your contacts even sooner. â¢ GPS-based search for a local eye doctor. â¢ Import your docâs information directly from your Address Book. â¢ Scan your credit card with the camera or use PayPal for less tiny-keyboard typing. â¢ Speedy reordering from your secure account. The 1-800 CONTACTS app is free to download and free to use. Freer than a bald eagle clutching an American flag punching the Berlin Wall. Itâs that free. You know what to do.",
