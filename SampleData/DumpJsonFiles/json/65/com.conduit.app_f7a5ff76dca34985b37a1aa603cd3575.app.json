    "description": "Baby Talk & Read videos are designed to help baby learn about the world around them, to recognise the sites and sounds of their environment.We are Cathy and Paul, the proud parents of 2 preschoolers. We began our journey with the 'Your Baby Can Read' video series, created by Dr. Robert Titzer, who also created his series for his own children. We found our kids really enjoyed the videos and over time began interacting with the images and saying the words. They eventually grew bored with the series, and we searched for something else educational that we could watch together. We eventually realised there was nothing much available in this style, so we decided to create our own stories in the form of 'Baby Talk and Read' videos. The videos are a great introduction to words and images, without overwhelming your little one with information. The stories are themed so the information is logical and in context, for example 'The Zoo' and 'Transport'. Our videos focus on language and recognising words and their meanings.We use 'still' images, slowed down, so baby has time to engage, understand and comprehend what they are seeing and hearing.  There are no moving images to distract or confuse baby.Baby Talk & Read videos also encourage interaction, by asking baby what they're seeing and giving them the opportunity to process the word, image and meaning, and later say the word.  Baby will in time begin to recognise the images and interact with them.  The narration also encourages listening and observation. The videos are similar to books and flashcards in that words are shown then followed by their picture.  Images show the real world in photographs, illustrating the world around them.  Images are not cartoon, make-believe or abstract.We hope you enjoy the stories as much as we enjoyed making them for you. Have fun and enjoy!",
