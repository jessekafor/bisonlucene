        "comment": "When I had my Droid OG I had no issues connecting to sametime, but once I got my galaxy nexus I have a lot of trouble connecting to the network.  I am not sure if it is a bug with the Nexus being it is so new or quipIM but I can never connect to sametime when on 3g/4g unless I can connect to wifi first.  Example, if I try to connect to sametime while on 3g/4g it will time out.  But if I am on WiFi and connect to sametime it immediately connects and then if I turn off WiFi it disconnects for 3 seconds and then establishes a connection again.  This is a very weird issue and I am not sure who I should report it to.",
