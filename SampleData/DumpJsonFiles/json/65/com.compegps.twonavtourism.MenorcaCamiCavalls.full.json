This route contains more than 200 cultural, historical and natural points of interest. The main sights are accompanied by images, videos and explanatory descriptions to provide an insight into this ancient trail.'CamÃ­ de Cavalls' (route GR 223) is a historical trail of 185 km that goes around the island by the coast. 'CamÃ­ de Cavalls' can be considered the best way to discover the great natural wealth and heritage of Minorca island, an island that combines almost all ecosystems in the Mediterranean sea.This route, being a sum of paths and trails, was born in late fourteenth century. Its original purpose was military, although it has had a large variety of uses throughout history. After decades of demands thanks to the involvement of citizens as well as public administrations, Gr 223 route has been reopened so that everyone can enjoy it again. _________________________________________HOW DOES IT WORK?_________________________________________By purchasing 'CamÃ­ de Cavalls 360Âº' the product includes the application itself as well as a free sample stage (Stage 2).
