        "title": "A little choppy...",
        "comment": "We should be able to choose which feeds we see (texts, chat, fb, etc). Texts that come in more than one mes. are impossible to read (often interrupted by other messages), and often there is missing texts in the 2+ messages. This makes the whole feed very choppy and confusing sometimes.  Discussions on Facebook can go all day, long after the hosts have finished talking about them, again making the feed confusing and choppy.  Hence allowing us to pick what we want to see could streamline the feed if desired.",
