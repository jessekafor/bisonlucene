    "description": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapy Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapy Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapy students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists. The academic content is organized into ten unique system and non-system categories. Musculoskeletal System Neuromuscular System Cardiopulmonary System Integumentary System Other Systems Equipment and Devices Therapeutic Modalities Safety and Professional Roles Teaching and Learning Research and Evidence-Based Practice Therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system categories or elect to review content in a random mode. Frequent review of essential academic content allows therapists to successfully convert the information to long term memory. Physical Therapy Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a therapists mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Therapists can elect to take examinations in a specific category (e.g., musculoskeletal system) or in a random mode. A formal score report describes a therapistâs level of mastery in each of the ten system and non-system categories.

        "title": "Regretful",
        "comment": "I had this on my iPhone which I replaced with an android based device so I ended up buying this app twice and I sincerely regret it. The information is solid in some places but is blatantly wrong in others, ex. A spinal cord injury is listed as a LMN disorder. There are also spelling and grammatical errors as others have mentioned. The questions and content are not nearly as thorough as the OSullivan NPTE prep guide which is what I would recommend to anyone serious about passing their boards.",
