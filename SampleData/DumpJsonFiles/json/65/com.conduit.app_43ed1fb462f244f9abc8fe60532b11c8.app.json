        "comment": "\\\"Mum can I play with your phone?\\\" my kids ask me all the time.   I found this App is a safe way to ensure that the videos kids watch are age-appropriate and do not have in-app purchases or adult adds. Kids navigate easily and love the books and the stories.   Yesterday my son used the App and leaned how to perform a magic trick, and later he showed it to his grandmother. I was very happy that he had learned something new, he was so happy.   I would recommend it to anyone with kids.",
