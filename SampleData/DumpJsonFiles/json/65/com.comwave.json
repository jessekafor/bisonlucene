        "comment": "Editing my previous review: What you read below, now is the opposite. You cannot dial through regular phone line using this app. You need internet connection, so this is just another VOIP. If you are away and have no internet conn. but have a phone signal, you cannot use this app.  My origianl review: \\\"I have a regular Comwave long distance account, and needed an app to dial overseas ld numbers straight from my phonebook, without dialing access no. first. This app enabled me to do exactly that. It would be nice if it would have possibility for some exclusions, instead of asking for every ld no. E.g. I just need overseas numbers to dial throug Comwave, and don\\'t need to be asked for North America.\\\"",
