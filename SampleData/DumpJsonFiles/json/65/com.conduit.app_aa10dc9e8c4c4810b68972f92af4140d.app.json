        "comment": "Wasn\\'t expecting much, but the advice column happens to be on point. It\\'s no fancy tech App but gives straight relationship advice. It worked perfectly with my Xperia phn, doesn\\'t open with older HTC android mobiles! Developer should try updating advice column more often, but generally good App. Highly recommended.",
