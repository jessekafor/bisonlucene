USCG and US Navy have only officer rankings. These rankings have the right icon but wrong info. An LTJG is an O2 not an O1  The created himself calls this a rubbish app. I should have heeded his warning and saved a dollar and twenty five cents as I don\\'t like paying for trash.  If you are going to charge for this at least make sure you are giving me and everyone else the right information to study.",
