    "description": "The skin of a newborn is very sensitive (even to mild irritants) and can easily be affected by inflammations or eruptions as a result of exposure to heat, prolonged contact with urine or faeces or chafing by a rough fabric. In case with such minor skin disturbances there is usually no need for panic though of course the cause should be removed. Eruptions and other skin disturbances that appear without any apparent cause and persist for several days should be shown to a doctor especially in case the baby appears to be sick. Use this app to understand possible diseases of skin.",
