I have yet to beat the computer on medium difficulty.  The game is good otherwise.  Please add a way to disable the animation in the game options.",

        "comment": "Only two negatives:  1) cut animation is not cribbage standard. 2) when counting, the computer opponent doesn\\'t show the crib cards.  Everything else is great.  Graphics are solid, game speed is good, ai is fine.  Definitely worth trying then buying imo.",
