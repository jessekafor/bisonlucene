    "description": "A marketing executiveâs life can be very polarized, caught between CFOs urging âFaster! Better! Cheaper!â, and CIOs proclaiming âDanger! Not without me! Everything takes 12 to 18 months!â. But, make no mistake, things have changed for the marketing executive. We are all living in interesting times.In CMO Hurricane, we discuss in great detail this new phenomenon â the shift to metrics-based justification of corporate funds for all programs, redefining marketing as more than brand awareness, with expected positive Returns On Marketing Investment (ROMI).To summarize, CMO Hurricane explains:How economic pressures have produced a new, bottom line-emphasis on your corporate business, especially in securing budget for your marketing programHow this new bottom line-approach affects how you plan and manage your marketing programHow this new approach requires new nomenclature and metrics to communicate effectively with the person holding your corporate purse strings â your Chief Financial Officer (CFO)How you can turn this new trend to your advantage by seeking strategic alliances with other C-level officers, especially your Chief Information Officer (CIO)In CMO Hurricane: The Turbulent World of Marketing Executives weâve given you a detailed description of what you are up against, how to formulate an entire new strategy to get the marketing budget you need to survive, then prosper when many of your peers will be floundering.",
