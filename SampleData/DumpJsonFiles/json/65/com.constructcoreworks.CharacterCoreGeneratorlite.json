    "description": "Lets say you're an artist. Lets also say you've been stuck drawing the same old thing for a while. Maybe you need practice on other things. Maybe you need something else to think for you. The Character Core Generator will randomly generate a character's visual appearance, as well as some other attributes such as attitude and willpower so you can properly imagine how they would look. This is an early version of the generator, and features a fraction of the content. There are plenty of professions and character archetypes to add. There are also more modes planned, featuring an original character situation/draw challenge, and a group character draw challenge.This is a drawing idea generator. It randomly chooses different fields describing a character. Think of it as a drawing aid, or something to use for practice once a day, like an art challenge.",
