    "description": "Stop & Replay is an indipendent electronic music group. It was born in May 2012 with the aim of enhancing the production of DJs operating in the Italian House music. We noticed it missing a project enhancing the musical expressions of Italian dance producers and DJs today, and instead took place on the world in the 80s and 90s.The music selection is conducted with the criterion of quality, timeliness, and new and includes all genres of music most popular in Italian and international Clubs: House, Tech House, Progressive, Electro House and Dance.Stop & Replay is on digital portals around the world including about 100 major Beatport,iTunes, Juno, DjShop, Djtunes etc and also publishes Compilation CD distribuited from Believe Digital.In 2012 we will take care of the image of DJs and producers in radio promotions with major TV, social networks (Facebook, Youtube, Myspace, Twitter etc.) and biographies of individual producers are goals we are working on a publication record so interesting to be valued and not is only a brief appearance in the musical chaos.",
