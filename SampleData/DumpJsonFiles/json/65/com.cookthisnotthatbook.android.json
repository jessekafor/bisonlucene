When you click on some recipes, it force closes the program (Chicken Pot Pie, Ricotta Cheesecake, etc...). I would love to try these. I love pot pie. Also I wish the grocery list would consolidate like items for ease at the grocery store. Some of the recipes have very odd entries under the \\\"What you\\'ll need\\\" tab. Look at the Pork Verde. It says the Pork should be cut into 1. ? Please fix bugs.",
