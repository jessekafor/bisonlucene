        "comment": "This app is almost perfect for my needs!  I actually turn the automatic \\\"popper\\\" feature off and just manually pop the prayer requests when I\\'m ready to sit down and pray.  The only thing that I think needs to be changed is answered prayers need to be removed from the main prayer list, so as to not clutter it.  It also will keep \\\"popping\\\" the answered prayers unless you actually delete them.",
