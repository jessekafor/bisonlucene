        "comment": "Doesn\\'t know anything about the XV-01 which has been out for months. What\\'s the point of a parts app that is never updated with new parts?  Update: The reply from the developer is simply wrong. XV-01 parts had been listed on Tamiya USA\\'s site / store for months, but none were listed by the app. I reiterate, an app which lags both retail and Tamiya\\'s site by months is essentially useless.  I note also that they took more than six months to bother replying, which shows how little effort is being put into the app.",
