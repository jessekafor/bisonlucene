    "description": "Bothered by having your phone flip to portrait or landscape while laying down? Too lazy to look around Android settings to enable/disable autorotate? This app is the solution.This is a very simple free app that allows you to do the following:- Lock your screen's rotation in Landscape, Portrait or Auto. When you launch the app, you're faced with these three options.- Includes a Tasker/Locale plugin so you can automate the rotation switch based on different profiles.- Ability to launch the app from any window in Android by long pressing on the search key. (Only for devices that have a physical search button).- Long press on any orientation profile to activate a persistent background service. (This is useful if your phone seems to exit the locked orientation all of a sudden due to low memory resources).- A widget is provided so you can lock into whatever your current orientation is. (Useful for reverse landscape for example).I've searched the Market for an app that will lock my screen's autorotate to landscape and found only one paid app that runs a service continuously in the background (regardless of chosen screen orientation) so I wrote this up. It's free and the background service is optional.It should work on any device sporting Android 2.1 (Froyo) and higher.keywords: screen control autorotate landscape portrait rotate rotation orientation",

        "comment": "Since Spotify can\\'t seem to be bothered with enabling a Landscape mode, I went with using Rotation Locker and setup a Tasker profile using the included plugin to force Spotify into Landscape.  It isn\\'t the most ideal solution, as Spotify overrides the Auto function about 2 seconds after it rotates and then doesn\\'t try again.  If I set the rotation to Landscape, it will open the app and rotate and stay, which is what I need, but obviously this means that, for as long as Spotify is open, it can only be in Landscape.  Since I use Spotify only when it\\'s docked in my car (or sitting on my desk at work) I can live with this.  I am thankful that Persistent Background service is a selectable option because I ONLY want to invoke this app in Spotify, not for any other applications. You earned your 5 stars on that aspect alone.  The fact that it\\'s free?  That\\'s icing on the WIN cake!",
