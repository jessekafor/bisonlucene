    "description": "Go through a series of Teen celebrity pictures pixelated and see how well you really know your teen celebs!  Guess Who the celeb is by their hair color, their hair, and by guessing who's face it is!.See how well you fare on these severely-reduced images.  If you get stuck, try keeping a few feet of distance between your eyes and the device.Humans are great at facial recognition, and a recent MIT study shows that around 80% of people can recognize faces of famous people from images made up of only a few pixels.Also, the game keeps track of how well you're doing by showing what percent of the time you're correct in your guesses.  Do you fall within that 80%?Find the game too easy?  Let us know and we'll make it harder come next release!  Want to see more images or more features?  Just send us an email or write a comment and we'll be sure to include it next time.Simple, no nonsense UI.  No useless menus and buttons to press.  As soon as you start the app, you're ready to play!This game features popular celebrities such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.Creating an app takes time and money, In order to keep creating great (and free!) apps, we are using a new search service to monetize our apps. With this service we are able to create more great apps for you guys. This option bundles a few search points (icon, bookmark and homepage) for you to use. You can erase these easily and with no effect to our app. Thanks!",
