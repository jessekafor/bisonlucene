Just get your âsuspectâ to say their statement into your phone, the app appears to record everything they say and tell them theyâre lying!!Of course you can prime the detector without their knowledge via a hidden button to allow you choose who tells the truth i.e. only you!Watch friends and family go red with embarrassment as your lie detector proves everything they say is a total fib and everything you say is the gospel truth!",
