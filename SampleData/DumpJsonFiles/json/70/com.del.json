    "description": "This is an application which helps in you in blocking calls and messages from any unreliable caller or message sender. This application provides you the ability to block any call, message or both from any particular phoneâs contact or number. It also avails you in blocking service messages especially like TD, TR, LM, IZ, etc.The most innovative aspect of the application is that the unwanted blocked phone callers are not even able to recognize that his or her calls have been black listed in your mobile and what he or she seems is just a busy ringtone during the call. So it doesn't provide the sense of black listing to the caller.",

When the contact tab is selected only the email contacts pops up insted of the phone book contacts. I have to manually enter the number  to be blocked  in the number tab. Please rectify it. otherwise its a GREAT application!",
