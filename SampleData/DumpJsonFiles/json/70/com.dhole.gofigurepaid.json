    "description": "What would your favourite movies look like if they were acted out by stick figures?Go Figure is a new kind of movie quiz game. We have drawn 200 movie scenes using stick figures. Some will be quite obvious. Others will be challenging for all but the biggest film buffs. You may need help from your friends to solve them; that's the idea of the game!The Free version of Go Figure comes with the first 200 movie scenes and occasional advertisements.The Premium version is advertisement free and features the following extra movie packs:* Horror pack* Cruise Control (the movies of Tom Cruise)* Cage Match (the movies of Nic Cage)* Go West (iconic Westerns)* More Bad Ways To Go (memorable movie deaths)We will continue to add more. Visit our Facebook page to vote for which movie packs we should create next",
