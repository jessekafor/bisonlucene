    "description": "Calculates Fuel Discount.  User enters the price, the discount amount, and the amount they want to spend - This app calculates how many litres to fill to, and what the price would read before discount.eg:  User wants to spend $20 to buy petrol at 135.9c with discount of 4c/L.  Application calculates that user should fill 15.16 Litres, with price reading of $20.61 (ie discount of 61 cents).NOTES:  This application has been developed for the Australian Market, and assumes Fuel is measured in Litres and a currency with 100c to the dollar.  This calculator does not guarantee to calculate the discount the same as a Petrol Station.  A small rounding variance may occur in some situations.  This calculator should be used as a guide only",
