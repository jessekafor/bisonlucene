Shame as DDS is a top discount provider, just need to provide an app that works now!!  Several updates later and the app still doesn\\'t work. Blank screen time after time. Tried uninstallaing and re-installing, still no joy. Running Orange\\'s San Diego smart phone, says the phone is compatible but obviously not the case. Still well disappointed. would be no star\\'s if that was an option, but it isn\\'t. Uninstalled and re-installed again today (04.09.13) still doesn\\'t work. Complete waste of time.",
