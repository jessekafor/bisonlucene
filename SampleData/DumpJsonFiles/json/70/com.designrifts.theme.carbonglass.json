    "description": "***PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW THE DESCRIPTION***Welcome to my Carbon Glass Theme. It is a mix of Carbon Fiber, my Glass Rings and Glass Squares themes and icons. The goal is to be a very unique, clean styled theme with a perfect mixture of the Glass Squares and Glass Rings to keep you intrigued.The theme was originally built for ICS but I have been adding more and more of the JB objects as the theme goes. I currently am still running ICS so testing changes is slightly difficult. What's Themed:    Framework and the associated icons    System UI    Settings    LatinIME (keyboard)    System Apps     Market Apps - GMail,(G+ in coming update), Plume, YouTubeMore apps will continue to be added, as well as adding more into the currently themed apps.*********INSTRUCTIONS***********THIS IS FOR ROOTED PHONES ONLY.....xHDPI & HDPI ONLYDo not ask me how to root your phone, I will not tell you.Install, Apply in Themes Setting, Reboot. If you get an error message saying the theme was not compiled correctly perform the following:    Apply System Theme    Reboot    Apply Carbon Glass    Reboot (to complete Theme instantiation)If the wallpaper does not change (very common), just reapply the theme and it will. No reboot is required after that step.*REBOOT AFTER APPLYING TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GETS APPLIED...even after updates**DO NOT MOVE TO SDCARD....WILL CAUSE ERRORS*If you have no idea what that means then PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD!Feel free to email questions.Thank You's:    T-Mobile for the Theme Engine    CM/AOKP/BAMF teams for adding it to their ROMs    Scar45 for the Nav Bar and JB help, and his PCB theme for providing some ideas    NMiltner for the JB help    DJDarkKnight96 for helping me with the Theme Engine",
