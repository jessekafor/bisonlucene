This app allows you to see which foods are a good glycemic index food that helps you lose wieht and balance your blood sugar as well as the bad foods that could make you gain more weight even faster. Glycemic Index Rating The glycemic index is a rating system that measures the effect food has on your bodyâs hormonal system. The higher the rating, the higher the insulin spike. You want to eat foods that create a low insulin response. Doctor Created Dr. Jenkins proved that many previously banned carbohydrates were, in fact, very healthy and should not be avoided simply because of the fact that they were carbohydrates. As a matter of fact, he discovered that there are dozens of foods that in the past were categorized as unhealthy, but that turned out to be very beneficial. He also encountered some surprising results on foods that had always been considered âdietâ foods, but when tested, he discovered that they tested very high on the Glycemic Index. The Glycemic Index Charts in this app reflect Dr. Jenkinâs finding and will help you instantly decide what to eat and what to avoid. Knowing the glycemic impact of the foods/drinks you consume will give you greater control over the biochemical message you want your body to receive.
