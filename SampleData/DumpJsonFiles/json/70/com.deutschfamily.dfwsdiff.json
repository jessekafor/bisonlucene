    "description": "The Deutsch Difference is a revolutionary sales tool that helps the Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits sales partners learn about our diverse brands. We save tens of thousands of dollars per year on printing costs, and the scope of who we can reach is limitless in terms of new business. Unlike a website or PDF file, the app does not require any special reception to use. The user can save an infinite number of custom lists based on his or her own criteria - that can then be e-mailed to any account or partner: no email attachments, just links that won't bog down anyone's inbox with huge files. This will help us reach out through the noise of a very competitive marketplace. Deutsch is proud to be the first in our industry with a robust tool optimized for the mobile revolution in sales and marketing.Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits was founded in 1981 by Chairman, Bill Deutsch, to market quality wine and spirits produced by prestigious families from major wine and spirits regions of the world.
