    "description": "*** Please note that this is FREE version & thus stores the video in B&W color only. For colored video recording, you can download the PRO version from market ***After a lot of suggestions from our customers, we have finally come up with the THIEF DETECTOR app.Position your phone properly (preferably opposite entrance), leave the app open.As soon as any motion is detected, the phone starts recording the video automatically. This way, you can detect the trespasser.On starting the app, phone goes in silent mode, to avoid any unwanted sound by the phone. Features - 1. Customizable sensitivity - you can adjust the sensitivity of motion (for example if you want to detect even the slightest motion - say of a rat - you can)2. Customizable duration of recording. (10 sec - 10 minute)3. Auto loop - It automatically repeats motion detection algorithm automatically once you have started the app.4. Low cost solution. 5. Disguise mode provided. (Shows black screen instead of preview)6. Saves records on SD card.Suggestions - 1. More the light, better the performance. The app cannot detect motion in the dark.We are building complete set of surveillance apps, so if you can think of any more features that could be added in the app, then do let us know at contact@dexterltd.com",
