        "comment": "killing an human, and projecting ravana as evil, actually this type of aps should be banned. he was the true and real devotee of \\'The God Shiva\\' than any other Hindus in the world. actually he didnt have 10 heads, it means he had 10 talents.....also he was \\'The Great King\\' who ruled Srilanka(tamil people) before the entry of lankans....... the software developer should study the Real, True history.... Ravana\\'s sister was teased and her nose was cut by Laxman, for revenge ravana took sita, but, even he didnt touch sita.Ravana is being worskipped by many north indian villagers as a God.  so remove this apps",

        "comment": "Game play, graphics and even the description made here are worst. Ravana is a great Sinhala king lived in Sri lanka. He ruled 10 kingdoms, including 9 big states of India. (that is how people used to tell he has 10 heads, which meant 10 kingdoms)  Rama\\'s kingdom was also governed by Ravana. So Rama was meditating in jungle with his brother and sister. As they were from royal family, Ravana had some respect towards them. Hence he directed his sister, Suparnika 2 care.",
