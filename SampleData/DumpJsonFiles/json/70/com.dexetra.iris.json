    "description": "Something that started out as a tongue-in-cheek reply to iPhone's Siri, iris. has grown much bigger than being just a Siri clone.Just ask iris. what you want to know. Right from asking how to cope up with your breakup to movie recommendations and questions on science, culture, history etc.********************************************************************************Thanks a ton for getting us 1 million downloads in just two months. We love you.********************************************************************************Note: You need to have \"Voice Search\" and \"TTS library\" installed in your phone for iris. to work. Most of the phones have these pre-installed, if not please install them from Android market before you try iris.Features- calender (Remind me of the meeting coming friday)- Alarm (Set alarm at 540 am)- Call someone (can you please call Bob)- text someone (send a text to Bob)- search nearby (find me a nearby coffee shop)- play music (play the song rolling in the deep)- ask movie reviews (should I watch the movie Mission Impossible)- watch videos (show me a video of cat singing)- find news (what is the news about SOPA)and lots and lots more. Discover for yourself.NOTE: New Permissions for voice dialing, texting, searching and contacts look up",
