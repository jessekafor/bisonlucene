    "description": "You can simulate Negev just shake your phone or just by clicking on the weapon. If you run out of bullets is just click on the charger that charges the Negev again. âThe phone vibrates when shooting\tâTo fire you just shake your phone or touch the screen.âGreat quality of the sound of gunfire.âMenu has the option to vibrate the cell while shoot. Menu also has the option to vibrate the phone to shoot.Technical specifications on the Negev  gun below is for users who do not know the NegevThe Negev is a gas-operated automatic firearm that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The bolt itself features 4 radial locking lugs that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).The Negev is striker-fired, where the bolt carrier assembly acts as the striker. The light machine gun fires from an open bolt position. A lever-type fire control selector switch is provided (âAâ â full-automatic fire, âRâ â semi-automatic fire), installed on the left side of the pistol grip, which doubles as a manual safety against accidental firing. The safe âSâ position disables the sear mechanism (which makes it impossible to cock the bolt carrier), by lifting the lever responsible for holding the bolt carrier in the forward position and disconnects the trigger mechanism from the sear. The weapon can be secured safe regardless of the position of the bolt carrier group. The cocking handle is equipped with a ratcheting mechanism that immobilizes the partially-cocked bolt carrier.The Negev feeds from an M27 disintegrating, open-link ammunition belt, carried in a 150-round fabric container that clips into the magazine well or alternately from a 35-round box magazine from the Galil assault rifle or a 30-round STANAG magazine from the M16 rifle (with the use of an adapter). 200-round ammunition belt containers are also available. Belted ammunition is introduced into the feed tray port from the left side, while the magazine is inserted vertically into the magazine well at the base of the receiver. The feed system uses a pawl feeding mechanism, driven by the recoiling bolt carrier, but the belt is moved only during the rearward movement of the bolt carrier. The non-reciprocating charging handle is located on the right side of the weapon.This gun have in games:Half Life, Combat Arms,Battlefield, Gunz the Duel, CS, Soldat, Doom, Quake, Americas Army, War Rock, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, SOCOM, Metal Gear Solid, Crysis,Tom ClancyÂ´s,Company of.
