        "comment": "This was a 1st game? Not bad! but moving left/right controls in2 the bottom left & right corners would greatly improve gameplay. I hav really small hands & i still had a real lot of trouble with the controls. Because of the way i had 2 position both hands on the bottom left corner of my ph i kept hitting the phs power off button so it was impossible 2 play without my ph turning off. Any1 with adult size hands will hav probs but a few little changes & sm goofy sound effects would make it pretty cool",
