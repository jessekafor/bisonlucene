Fixed my connection problems with this and DroidVPN.  Also IPs instead of hostnames always connect faster for me too.  Who has two thumbs up and got lots-o-music now ... this guy :D",

        "comment": "As someone who uses a VPN to route all their internet traffic back through my home router for safety\\'s sake I had a heck of a time using a VPN with juice defender. If you loose connection the built in VPN disconnects you and never tried to reconnect or even alert you that it has disconnected. It becomes a tedious PINTA after not too long with the multiple clicks to re-enable every time.   I\\'ve tried all the VPN apps out there, there are some great ones that do reconnect, VPNcilla is great for IPsec and the straight up original open VPN installer and settings never has a problem or has failed me, it has a auto reconnect built in........but very few apps are specifically designed for PPTP and if your running a home VPN that\\'s what it will be. This app is a god send for PPTP users, the widget alone is worth the donation to go pro, truly 1 click VPN connection that can operate side by side with juice defender and reconnect you when juice defender disconnects and reconnects your radio to save power.  This is the only PPTP VPN app you will ever need, period.",
