I have tried this with - Tunein Pro, You Tube, MX Player with no issues. I like the \\\"blues\\\" setting on the eq & this really makes live performances sparkle on You Tube- even without the virtulizer turned on. I ditched the paid \\\"Equalizer\\\" app I had for this, much better off with this app IMO.",
