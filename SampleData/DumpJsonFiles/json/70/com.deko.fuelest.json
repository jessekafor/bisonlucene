        "comment": "How can this be app accurate? It doesn\\'t know what gear I\\'m in, whether it\\'s manual or auto. The condition of the engine. It could ask for the last MOT figures for emissions. I could be doing 50mph in 4th,5th or 6th gear. Sorry but it needs more details than type of fuel, size of car and age of car to be any where near accurate enough to predict fuel saving...... Just glad it was a free app. But on the positive side, I do like the idea behind it.",
