        "comment": "I recently started using a phone with external storage again after having used a phone with on board storage only for awhile. I used this on previous devices with external storage and it was perfect for managing storage. Giving only 3 stars because I cannot get anything to move to the sd card. Looking for a solution to come along as I know this app worked great in the past.  Update: I have discovered that the issue I am having is due to my device,  not the app. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.",
