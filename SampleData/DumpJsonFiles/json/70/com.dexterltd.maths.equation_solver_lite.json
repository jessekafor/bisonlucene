    "description": "MOST ADVANCED NON LINEAR equation solver (root finding) app on android market. Must have tool for college going students having mathematics as one of the subjects.** This is free ad supported app. If you like this app, do donate us by purchasing PRO version from market. It's named as \"Equation Solver (Root Finding)\"App uses root finding techniques to find root of linear as well as non linear equations.  Methods provided - 1. Bisection Method2. Newton-Raphson Method3. Secant MethodYou can choose which method you want to use to find the solution. Considering students' requirement, the app shows step by step iterations.You can also compare results you got from different methods and see which one is more powerful and takes few iterations.  Customized keyboard is provided so that you don't have to type Sin, Cos, Log, aSin etc. while inputting the expression. Note - We have developed many more mathematical tools like - Graph Plotter, Differentiate It, Numerical Calculus, Matrix Calculator, Interpolation Calculator, Fourier Transform Calculator. Do have a look.For any issues/suggestions, drop us a mail at manas.gajare@dexterltd.comNote - We love creating apps, and want to keep them free forever. In order to keep our development running we are using a search service to generate some revenue from this free app. This app will add a couple search links on your device in the form of an icon, bookmark link and browser homepage. You may delete them easily (drag to the trash or delete the link for the browser), if you choose to use them, thanks!Keywords - Numerical methods, Newton Raphson, Bisection, Secant, equation, root, solve, root finding, linear, non linear, root finding algorithm, maths, mathematics.",
