        "comment": "Stability has improved over v.12 greatly. Being able to perform quotes in the field is so much easier now!!! Still needs to be able to store info locally, especially price books. And be able to upload pictures from gallery versus having to use the app camera access. Once again we don\\'t always have a signal. Sooo slow at times for things to pull up that I just looked at.",
