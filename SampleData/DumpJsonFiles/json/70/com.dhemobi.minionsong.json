    "description": "The Minions are small, yellow, cylindrical, creatures who have one or two eyes and are one of the most notable characters in the films.They are impulsive creatures with little self-control, but with a wide-eyed wonder and odd innocence that endears them to viewers and makes them relatable. They can be pesky when they are doing weird interactions with other people, animals, or objects. The Minions have standard English names such as Dave, Stuart, Kevin, Jerry, Carl, Phil, Paul, Jorge, Tim, Donny, Mark, Lance, Tom, John, Steve , Frank and Bob.Unlike most other criminal masterminds and their usual doctrine of abusing their henchmen, Gru gets along famously with his minions. He genuinely seems to like them and even shows appreciation for their hard work and support. He even seems to know each of them by name.____ *** Banana Song Minions* i swear minions* Underware by Minions* YMCA Song bu Minions* despicable me 2 minion song lyrics* despicable me 2 wedding song* Video and Lyrics**____âº Note:*It should be understood that \"Despicable Me\" and \"Despicable Me 2\" content and materials are trademarks and copyrights of Illumination Entertainment its licencors.
