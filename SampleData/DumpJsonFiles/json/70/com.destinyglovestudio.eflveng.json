        "comment": "Some of the puzzles in this game are a little complicated because the clues given don\\'t seem to relate to the puzzle, besides that it\\'s a great game. There are a lot of spelling errors in the game which removes from the authenticity and professionalism. Fix that and it\\'s a cool game!",

And I was not sure I had reached the end of the game when I had! Also way too short. Waste of money.",
