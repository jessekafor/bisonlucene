    "description": "Event Manager helps you get the most out of your Android device by having your device respond to events which occur and taking certain actions.  For instance, when you plug your device into AC power, you would like to have your device shut off bluetooth, WIFI and turn down the notification volume.  Another example would be automatically launching navigation or starting your playlist playing on Mondays and Fridays when you dock the device in your car.  It is also possible to schedule events to have your ringtone change for instance on workdays at 8AM and schedule another event to change to a home ringtone at 5PM.  Nesting conditions are also possible where your device only takes actions if all conditions are met.  This application was designed to be as light on the system as possible to achieve the desired results.  For instance, the scheduler is setup so that when you create scheduled events, the app sets an alarm within Android and then goes dormant until Android notifies the app that the schedule has been met.  The way the application was designed there is no polling or constant running activities which may impact your battery.  Everything is âset and forgetâ until the Android operating system notifies the app that it needs to respond to a condition.Conditions:WIFI Change (connected to SSID / Disconnected)A specific time and dayBattery state changes (LOW/OK)Between time/day rangeDisplay state changes (display on/off)Dock state changes (docked desk, car or undocked)Headset state changes (headset plugged or unplugged)Power state changes (plugged USB and/or plugged AC)When the device rebootsResults:Change notification or ringtoneChange ringer, notification, music and alarm volume settings independently.  Launch applicationLaunch web pageStart listening to a playlistPlay a soundChange screen off timeoutText-To-SpeechToggle WIFIToggle airplane modeToggle auto rotateToggle bluetoothToggle mobile dataToggle account syncWidget support is now available which allows you to execute an event on touch.  Try it out by adding a widget for your event to the home screen.  You can now enable/disable an event by long pressing the event.  This is useful should you need to disable an event from automatically executing.  A disabled event can still be executed via the widget so if you create a widget and do not want the widget to follow the normal automatic execute conditions, simply create the event and disable it.  Your widget will still execute the event on touching.  Version 1.8Added new text-to-speech resultAdded execute via event long pressAdded result launch web pageFixed Bug in \"Between day/time does\" day matchingFixed Bug in \"at a specific time\" not executing due to seconds/milliseconds differentFixed missing serialVersionUID in TimeSpecificChanged \"Between day/time does\" will not execute.
