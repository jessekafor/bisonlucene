Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared in the television shows Star Search and The New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as the lead singer and youngest member of the boy band 'N Sync, whose launch was financed by Lou Pearlman.During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his solo studio albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006); the former spawned hits \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\", while the latter debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". With each album exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time and Friends with Benefits. In 2013, he resumed his music career with his third album The 20/20 Experience (2013), which was preceded by lead single \"Suit & Tie\".
