    "description": "Doctor Who TARDIS LWP: Now comes with two live wallpapers.-Touch controlled TARDIS-Eleventh Doctor opening sequenceNOTE: This will not appear under your applications, but will rather appear as two wallpaper services when you go to Menu -> Wallpaper -> Live Wallpapers.I realize the image quality is less than desirable but please understand that it's a trade-off between frame rate & resolution and battery drain. I've received comments about the performance and chose to sacrifice smoothness and compress the images to more wisely use system resources. Please have realistic expectations.NOTE: if the wallpaper appears blank, touch the screen.If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to email me at didacticdev@gmail.comKNOWN ISSUES:-None! \"My ship don't crash. She crashes, you crashed her.\"",

After the third, the wallpaper reverted back to the factory default, I tried to change it back, but it wasn\\'t there! I went into safe mode and uninstalled the app, then reinstalled it, BUT it turns out there was an update on march 9th that I never got! After I reinstalled, everything was back to normal except for the damaged sd card, but it i backed it up, + restored it. Contact",

My ONLY complaint, or suggestion, would be that for that version of the background there might be different starry sky scenes to choose from, or that the stars might twinkle?  I wish there were more WORKING DW themed apps out there, like for SMS. You seem to know what you\\'re doing, maybe you should give it a go? :O",

All of which could easily be added thru the wallpaper options screen.   Please consider the tablet users out there, like myself.. B-)   Kudos for the effort, although I don\\'t think this is worth the $ as it is currently. 3 things; Sounds option, High rez/tablet background image, & option to have Tardis randomly float.",
