        "comment": "I needed something to keep track of my measurements and weight, which this does just fine.  I decided to pay for the full app to get benefit of the chart , body fat calculation, etc. These functions are not good, the chart is poorly designed and then body fat % is calculating incorrectly - it says I have a body fat % of 62 when my BMI is 25... obvious bugs need to be sorted out, I\\'m a little disappointed I paid for this :(",
