    "description": "Device Magic Forms enables your team to collect structured data quickly and easily on their smartphones and tablets. Design forms on our web-based designer, push them to your team, and route their responses through to a wide range of connectors. The questions you place in your forms support a range of data types: - text - numeric - date/time - yes/no - images (answered with the camera) - location (answered with the GPS) - select one - select many - phone number - email - signature - (and more) and can include validation constraints (prevent the form from being submitted) and be conditionally visible on the flow of answers already provided. The app supports offline form completion (no network connectivity available), and saving of partially completed forms for returning to at a later time. On the server, received forms can be delivered through a options, including: - email (as text, email, Word, and PDF)- SMS - inserted into a Google Spreadsheet - stored in Amazon S3 - routed to any HTTP REST endpoint The server API also supports pushing pre-populated forms to specific members of your team, as a 'oneshot' work item for them to complete. For more information and to sign up (free for a single device, and free trials available for larger teams), please visit us at http://www.devicemagic.com",

        "comment": "I was taking reams of paper with me to each place I went to work.I sometimes felt like I was handing the clients a book and asking them to sign each page. I went looking for something that could help me with this and I tried many different form creators. None of them did what I wanted, where so complicated, high priced and lacking in features.I had about given up when I found  Device Magic, without much hope I thought i would give it a try. I went into this expecting to delete the app from my device after a few seconds. I almost did to be honest. I opened the app and it said that I had to go build the forms on their website.   I logged in expecting to get spammed and scammed.  The site was easy to use and forms set up like a breeze,. They deliver what they offer, everything worked the first time. If you need a form creator look no further. This one is the best. Have your business go green. Go paperless with ease.",

Really good range of data capture options, including bar codes, GPS and camera. Sensible architecture with local application doing the work, but form designed on PC (yay! No faffing about trying to design on the device!) Pass through to Google Docs for the data is neat and works well.  Looking forward to seeing how they take it forward, but well worth a go now.",
