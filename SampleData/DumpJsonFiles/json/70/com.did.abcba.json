        "title": "Best Household Expense Splitting App in 100\\'s",
        "comment": "This app is great. Easy to enter transactions. Allows you to split transactions both equally and unequally.  Also sorted transactions in date order.  Plus allows you to assign a category to each expense to monitor your spending type as a household, rather than just individually.  If only it would export to Excel it would be very close to perfect, but the summary PDF is very nice!",
