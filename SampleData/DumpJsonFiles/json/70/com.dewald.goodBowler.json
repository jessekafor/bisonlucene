        "comment": "Not bad if all you want to track is what each shot was. Would be a 5 if you could track tournaments with more than 3 games. Also I\\'m not sure why the tracking of where you stand vs where the ball goes? If that data were accessible,  that would be good. Another feature that would help is ability to remove history or leagues your not in anymore.",
