    "description": "Lottery Companion is more than a random number generator.Lottery Companion uses a complex algorithm to choose numbers based on probability. Use credits to enable the Lottery Companion's analysis and prediction algorithm. The more credits spent on a drawing, the greater the number of drawings used in the analysis algorithm will be and the better the results will be.To utilize Lottery Companion's analysis features first, purchase credits in the credits tab. In the drawing tab choose an existing lottery game, like Mega Millions, Power Ball, Pick 3 and Pick4, from the preset tumbler or customize the tumbler setup to fit another game.Finally, specify the number of credits to spend on the analysis press DRAW and let Lottery Companion do the work for you.Lottery Companion can also select random lottery numbers without analysis. Simply press the DRAW button without spending any credits and Lottery Companion will choose a random set of lottery numbers. If you need help at any time, press the question mark button next to each section to learn more.",
