    "description": "The goal of Project Time Log is to keep track of time you've spent on projects. There are three main actions: 1. Add one or more projects; 2. Start the timer for the project you start working on. Stop the timer when you stop working. You can repeat this as often as you wish; 3. View the log to learn how much time you've spent on your projects (per timer, per day and in total). In addition to these actions you can: - change project properties any time; - make changes to your logs or add/delete logs manually: this comes in handy when you forgot to stop or start the timer; - use the build-in notification system to alert you when a certain amount of time has been exceeded. - export logs for use in spreadsheetsProject Time Log has been designed to be intuitively simple. The best way to get to know it is by testing and trying. There is a predefined 'test project' which you can use for that purpose. When finished testing you can delete it without any consequences. A powerful feature of Project Time Log is that once you've started a timer, it will simply keep on counting until you stop it, even when your device is completely switched off. #################################################### For advanced features, check out Project Time Log Pro.   ####################################################For questions, remarks or suggestions, please contact info@devjockeys.com.",
