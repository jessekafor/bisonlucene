Keeps track of your items and shows what kind of potions you can make and how many and you can even sort it by how much value they are so you can earn that good money :) And after youve made the potion and told the app that you made # of that potion, the app updates the results so youll know what you can do with your remaining ingredients. Time consuming inputting stuff but totally worth it!",

A way to move data from the free app and the Pro app.  Had the free app for a few days and felt it was so useful I wanted to support the creators.",
