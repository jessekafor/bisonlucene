        "comment": "An almost perfect app, does what it\\'s supposed to and is easy to use. The input really needs autosave functionality, since the text disappears for various reasons. Custom categories and colors should be an option. Finally, it would be neat if calendar view showed the dreams as multiple colored dots instead of just blue dots, and if list view had an option to just display titles, category and color for an overview of recent dreams. All in all though this is the best dream journal app I\\'ve seen.",
