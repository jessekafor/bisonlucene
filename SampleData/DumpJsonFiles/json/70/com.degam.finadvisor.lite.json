        "comment": "Financial Advisor is a great tool for tracking and planning you spending. The creators have included elements and functions that not only predict spending but also help you see how to plan spending so you can afford big ticket items. There are still a few bugs in the program (sometimes the expenses on the balance sheet don\\'t add up, it seems to have to do with the date on which they were entered). Also making the program synchronizable between phones would be very helpful to couples and families.",
