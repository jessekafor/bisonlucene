    "description": "**IMPORTANT**Market Bug. Pressing Open from Market app will say the app is not installed, but it is installed properly. Find it in the app drawer. If you have any questions or problems with Void Lock, send me an email. There's an option in settings for that.I can not respond to problems written in the market comments.------A gesture lockscreen replacement that offers both convenience and security.Imagine this scenario:A guy picks up your phone. What's the first thing he'll do? Turn it on of course.He presses the power button... no response. Presses a couple other buttons and touches the screen... no response.What's the first thing he'll think of? Phone's Off. Battery's Dead.It wouldn't occur to him that the phone is actually ON, but pretending its off.Features:-Two methods of unlocking--Gesture Mode--Key CombinationsBoth offering an incredible amount of security-App launching from lockscreenYou're able to create gestures for ANY app and launch it from the lockscreen. Please be advised that if you use simple gestures for these, it places your device at risk more-Activate Settings from lockscreenNeed to turn phone to vibrate? Normal lockscreens requires you to unlock the phone, then unlock the lockscreen, then pull down the status bar to press Volume. Now, just do a volume down gesture, its safer too-MugShotFor Android 2.3+ devices, there is front camera support to take pictures after a certain amount of failed attempts at unlockingIssues:-Certain devices will have their screens turned off if Display brightness is too low. The Setup screen will try to take care of that. So read the instructions, and email me if anything. I should probably address the issues that some users are having with uninstalling. Void Lock can not be uninstalled after you have set it as a Device Admin. To uninstall, go to Settings, then find Security, find Device Adminstrator, and disable it.Now, if there's any questions or suggestions, email meThis version is free, but still the full version. Differs from the paid version because of the ads, but DO NOT WORRY, ads will only appear after a successful Unlock and only once every 2 hours. Sorry, but... I need to eat too. However, I don't want anyone to miss out on the lockscreen because of price so at least now there's an alternative way to get the lock?Now if anyone is curious about the permissions used...-android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, Used to run at boot.-android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS, Used to lower the display's brightness-android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, Used to make the lockscreen-android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD, Used to make the system lockscreen not show up-android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, Used for mugshot image files-android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN, Used for bluetooth on or off, forgot-android.permission.BLUETOOTH, Used for... if the other was on then this is off, or vice versa-android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE, Used for enabling or disabling wifi-android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE, Same as above-android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE, Used to detect incoming call-android.permission.WAKE_LOCK, Used for WakeLock mode, for the users who has battery and wants to avoid pressing Power button-android.permission.VIBRATE, Just Vibrate-android.permission.INTERNET, MugShot Emails and ads-android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, same as above-android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS, Used to find default EMail account to mail to. Impossible to get account information-android.permission.CAMERA,Take a picture-android.permission.SET_PREFERRED_APPLICATIONS,Necessary for getting default launcher-android.permission.READ_CONTACTSNecessary for getting number of missed calls-android.permission.READ_SMSNecessary for getting number of unread SMS number",

        "comment": "Setting the \\\"button configure\\\" is your backup way to unlock your phone if the program doesn\\'t recognize your unlock gesture (which it wont because the sensitivity is to high to start, but you can change it) so pick something simple like press the Volume Down button 3 times the combo should say 25 25 25. So when the phone looks broke just push the Volume Down 3 times give it a sec and it will start up. IF YOU ARE GOING TO LOCK YOUR PHONE MAKE SURE YOU PICK A COMBO YOU CAN REMEMBER!!",
