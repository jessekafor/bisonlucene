Originally a console game, DMC received overwhelming response when it was ported to PC for the first time. Since then, this series has thrilled many of us with hours of solid game play and no holds barred combat with demons, undead, evil humans and what not. The recent release of DMC 4 has further bolstered this series, giving it a leverage like never before.As always, the game features the devil hunter Dante in the lead. As usual, Dante's power of transforming into a demon under certain circumstances has been retained. Add a loaded gun and a razor-sharp sword and you have Dante, badder than ever. This time, however, you do not get to plow through the entire game as the stylish devil hunter, a new hero is also available with whom you must play for two-thirds of the game. Enter Nero, a member of a mystical clan who is hunting Dante to avenge the murder of their leader some years back. Nero does not have an impressive arsenal like Dante, but he has a demonic arm which does come in handy in dishing out damage in spades. Nero can pull enemies from afar and throw them around, chop them up with his sword, 'the Red Queen' and shoot through their heads with his pistol, 'the Blue Rose'. The demonic arm brings a good amount of variety to the game and it is really a lot of fun pulling off tough combos in order to receive great bonuses to damage, health or other statistics. Later into the game, Nero acquires an enchanted weapon that is a wonder to behold.When you get to control Dante, you will love the arsenal he comes with. You have the standard sword and pistol, along with some mystical weapons. His trademark style of flipping enemies through the air with his sword and shooting them through their brains has been retained. Plus, there are other cool moves which we have not seen before. The only problem with the moves is that most of them involve chopping enemies up or slamming them against structures till their skulls bleed. Not a pretty sight. This time around, there is lots of blood and gore, the game almost looks like a bloodfest. While dedicated gamers should be able to handle the buckets of blood, gamers with queasy stomach better stay away from this title. The graphic violence in this game is enough to make a grown man cringe at times.",
