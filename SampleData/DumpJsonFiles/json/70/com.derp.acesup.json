    "description": "Simple solitaire game, the goal is to remove all cards except the four aces.The rules are simple: You remove cards by moving them from the four piles at the bottom to the \"trash\" area. A card can only be removed if there is a card of the same suit, but of higher valor at the top in any of the other piles. If a pile is empty you can move any card into that position.It's quite hard to clear the game, so have patience!Press menu in-game for more help.Note that this game is supported by ads. Please show your support by showing interest in the ads.This solitaire game is also known as \"Idioten\" (The idiot in swedish), referring to the tough nature of the game. The deck, and most of the other graphics have been created by myself with my limited photoshop skills. Please bear with me! ;)Any feedback is appreciated!",
