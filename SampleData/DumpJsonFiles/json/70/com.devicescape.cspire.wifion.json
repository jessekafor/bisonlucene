    "description": "NOTE: WiFi ON is for C Spire Wireless Android customers only.Welcome to the WiFi ON application from C Spire Wireless! This is a free service that gives you access to the worldâs largest network of quality WiFi hotspots. WiFi ON automatically connects your device to select public and amenity WiFi hotspots and helps you save on mobile data usage. Additionally, WiFi ON tests the hotspots for functionality and Quality of Service (QoS). Once set-up, WiFi ON operates in the background â no user intervention is required. WiFi ON makes connecting to WiFi networks convenient and easy.Note that WiFi ON does not replace the native Android Wi-Fi connection manager. Rather, WiFi ON boosts the connection managerâs performance by identifying which hotspots to connect to and, more importantly, how to connect to them.  For example, many public hotspots are portal based and this means a user with an ordinary Android device must manually connect to the hotspot SSID in the device settings and then must launch their device browser and tap on an âacceptâ button on the portal page before they get a working WiFi connection. WiFi ON takes care of all these steps automatically for over 12 million pre-qualified public and amenity WiFi hotspots.WiFi ON is designed to have negligible impact on battery life when compared to an equivalent device that has Wi-Fi enabled.  If you notice a change, it may be because your data consumption is increasing and/or because the screen is enabled more often. Using WiFi ON ensures the maximum benefit can be obtained from having Wi-Fi enabled and is strongly recommended.",

Found myself repeatedly turning wifi off because network sign in took too long to be bothered with.   Simpler to just turn wifi on manually when I wanted to get off the mobile network.",

        "comment": "This app cuts out \\\"a button push\\\" if you turn on native Wi-Fi, it will connect to any open hot spot connection.  If you have to enter credentials, you still have to enter them into the app. Your native Wi-Fi connection saves this info already. This app saves you no step and is a ploy and total waste of time. Boo Bad Boo, C Spire. Give us an app that breaks locked, passworded Wi-Fi and then you\\'ll have something.",
