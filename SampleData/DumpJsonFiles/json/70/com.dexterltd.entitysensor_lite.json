Me and my boyfriend have to go to the laundry mat to wash clothes as we do not have a wash or dryer of our own.  Well tonight my boyfriend stayed home and I used the recorder on here and caught a young womans voice when I place this on top of my car. Now my car is an older car that is an 1984 and it was wrecked before I got it. I\\'m thinking maybe it was the woman who died in the accident because you can hear the female voice clear as day say \\\"help me\\\"",
