Its not 100% reliable, I think it gets removed from memory by android and thats when it stops working, and the light can remain either on or off.  Im no android dev, but this might be solved by putting something in the notification bar, to avoid android closing this app?  Also, I would *love* to extend the functionality to have this backlight flash when there is a notification, as my phone doesnt have a notification LED. Release it as payware and Ill gladly pay for it!",
