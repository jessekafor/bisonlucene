    "description": "Sleep Timer can stop media after a set amount of time.Listen to music as you fall asleep, watch TV using SlingBox, listen to the radio, watch a movie. Sleep Timer can stop all these and more from waking you up by turning them off while you sleep.Features- Works with **video** as well as audio applications- Customize what happens when the timer ends- Stops music from playing instead of just turning the volume downNote: Video applications do not need any actions for Sleep Timer to stop them.  Try different actions with audio applications using the 1 minute timer to find an action that works.Many audio apps do not have a \"Stop\" function; \"Play/Pause\" usually works.To delete an application from the main list, long press and press delete.Have Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich? Try Sleep Timer for Android 3.0+!There is a rare issue with the timer freezing. Still investigating the cause.",
