        "comment": "Had me confused at first because the totals it was giving me were way out after entering the stats from my gas bill. If your gas meter units are rated in m3 then make sure you change the \\'Conversion Factor\\' to 1. Now it\\'s accurate. Would be 5 stars if the app could log a weekly or monthly meter read so I can see at a glance my weekly heating costs.",
