        "comment": "Every view looks like it was made for a 12 tear old girl. Also, despite the fact that I looks compact it takes up the whole page and so cannot be used with other apps or widgets. I kno it only costs a dollar but I would buy a coffee instead. Is there a rating lower than  star!?!",

I tried to change the skin but couldn\\'t. Only way I was able to change the skin was by erasing the widget and then put it back on my screen very annoying.  Please fix!!",
