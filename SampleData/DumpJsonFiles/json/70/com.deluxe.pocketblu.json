        "comment": "EVERYTHING about this app is flawed. First, I try to redeem my code by camera, but the app messes with my camera (same with my tablet). Then, I redeem the code by typing it and realize I didn\\'t have enough memory. So I get another memory card and try to redeem again but it tells me the code is invalid and now I can\\'t get my digital copy! Also, when I go into my library and try to return to the catalog, the catalog never loads. The only thing this app is good for is to be a bluray remote.",

If there were more studios backing this it would be awesome but since I have only a few discs this works for it\\'s more of a novality.The technical issue with this app is the camera to scan was warped, but it\\'s not a big deal as it\\'s for the extra content and not to use the remote. Overall it was good just needs more studios backing it to be great.",

        "comment": "I saw an ad for this app preceding one of my Blu-ray movies that I had seen several times before. Never saw the ad before, though. I installed it and was immediately thrilled. Why? Because it has the functionality to replace - at least in part - my Blu-ray player\\'s remote control. The remote that came with my player has buttons which are difficult to depress enough to have them have an affect on the player. The app\\'s remote works far better. That alone is enough to make me give this app a positive rating. I\\'m giving it only 4 stars, rather than 5, simply because I\\'ve only been able to test it with one movie.",

It used to say it was waiting for wi-fi, but now it doesn\\'t say anything at all.  I\\'m beginning to understand why some people just download films from the internet. Why pay $25-$30 for all the junk when all I want is to watch a movie?",
