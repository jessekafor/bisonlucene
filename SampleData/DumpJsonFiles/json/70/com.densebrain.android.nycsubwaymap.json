        "comment": "I like many others used this app for the train schedules, but they were removed and then included and finally removed again. This is too bad for the app, but honestly I don\\'t even use it anymore unless I really need a map, which isn\\'t often. This used to be a great application, but since the best feature was removed it has fallen into the abyss. Thankfully the MTA is alright with their schedule displays so one doesn\\'t have to rely on this as much.  Avoid!!",
