With all the 7 to 10 inch tablets you think they would format this to fit those screens by now. Cute interface but lacks the basic things needed to make list for people\\'s gifts. It\\'s nice to store someone\\'s pant\\'s size but maybe so area\\'s to put the store\\'s you would like to purchase it\\'s at, how much you found them for etc. All this has to be put in this notes area which is stupid.  It has a lot of potential but once again it fails to come through as a good useful app. There are plenty of ones out there that are much better.  Developers either fix this or remove it because I have waited for a year and nothing....again.",
