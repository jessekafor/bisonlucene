He is considered the Supreme God within Shaivism, one of the three most influential denominations in Hinduism, whereas in other branches of Hinduism such as in the Smarta tradition, he is regarded as one of the five primary forms of God. He is \"the Destroyer\" or \"the Transformer\" among the Trimurti, the Hindu Trinity of the primary aspects of the divineShiva is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of lingam. He is described as an omniscient yogi, who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash, as well as a householder with a wife Parvati, two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. Shiva has many benevolent as well as fearsome forms. He is often depicted as immersed in deep meditation, with his wife and children or as the Cosmic Dancer. In fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons.In many holy texts and puranas like Mahavishnu, Shiva or Mahadeva is also called Paramatman (Supreme soul). Shaivas often see him as Parabrahma (Supreme Brahman), and is regarded as Bhagwaan by devotees. The Shiva Sahasranama (1000 names of Lord Mahadev) declares Shiva as \"Paramatman\", the supersoul found everywhere.Shiva, In Wikipedia. Retrieved March 10,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva",
