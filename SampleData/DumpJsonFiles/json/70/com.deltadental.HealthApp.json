        "comment": "If all you need is to find a network dentist, then this app should fulfill what you need.  That being said, it is pretty poorly constructed.  Graphics are flimsy, buttons are small, the \\\"find a dentist\\\" feature simply directs you to their website.  There are really no native features to this \\\"app\\\".  You will have better luck with their mobile website.",
