    "description": "The M16 is a magnificent weapon and you can simulate shooting on your cell.You can simulate M16 just shake your phone or just by clicking on the weapon. If you run out of bullets is just click on the charger that charges the M16 again. âThe phone vibrates when shooting\tâTo fire you just shake your phone or touch the screen.âGreat quality of the sound of gunfire.âMenu has the option to vibrate the cell while shoot. Menu also has the option to vibrate the phone to shoot.Technical specifications on the M16 gun below is for users who do not know the M16.The M16 (officially Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16) is the United States military designation for the AR-15 rifle adapted for both semi-automatic and full-automatic fire. Colt purchased the rights to the AR-15 from ArmaLite, and currently uses that designation only for semi-automatic versions of the rifle. The M16 fires the 5.56Ã45mm NATO cartridge. The rifle entered United States Army service and was deployed for jungle warfare operations in South Vietnam in 1963, becoming the U.S. military's standard service rifle of the Vietnam War by 1969, replacing the M14 rifle in that role. The U.S. Army retained the M14 in CONUS, Europe, and South Korea until 1970. Since the Vietnam War, the M16 rifle family has been the primary service rifle of the U.S. armed forces.The M16 has also been widely adopted by other militaries around the world. Total worldwide production of M16-style weapons since the design's inception has been approximately 8 million, making it the most-produced firearm of its caliber. As of 2010, the M16 is being phased out in the United States Army, and is being replaced by the M4 carbine, which is itself a shortened derivative of the M16A2. The M16 could be supplemented by the Individual Carbine beginning in 2014 if procurement of a new weapon is attained, if funds allow. This program is for the US Army. While all other services will stay with current M-16s and M-4 series weapons.",
