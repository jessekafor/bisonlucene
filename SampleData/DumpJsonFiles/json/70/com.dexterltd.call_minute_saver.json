        "comment": "this is really simple to use app, but...: - beep is horrible (and very noisy - can damage your hearing) however it can be reduced by reducing media-volume in settings but not directly inside app. vibration alert would be much much better...  app cannot be copied to SD-card, it copies itself into app-private which is strange - so beware!",
