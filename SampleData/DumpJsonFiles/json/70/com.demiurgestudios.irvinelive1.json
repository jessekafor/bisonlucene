        "comment": "It is an amazing game.I love how there is the pause thing showing the hillbilly and the robot having a beer brake.anyway, now for the tips.1. Use the crate weapons only for the big robots. And im talking about level 3+ (first there is baby spider, then average chainsaw, then there are the abnormal ones. Abnormal are about level 3 or higher.) 2. For those who dont know, the areas on the ground that are cracked have the underground ones that pop out. 4. (This almost applys with ALL GAMES that have upgrade shops) upgrade the money maker/enhancer and unlimited ammo weps as priority (or in this case, upgrade the pistols.) If you remember the 4th one, you will be an even better gamer",

Also when you want to jump it swipes you up or down or if you want to go up or down it makes you jump. Why is there no dedicated jump button? Also the weapons get more and more useless as you upgrade.",
