When creating a new bed the dimensions can be selected-- ranging from 1 by 1 to 4 by 8 square foot plots. Details of every plot can be saved along with a journal entry/task tracker.  This is a valuable tool for creating successful gardens by learning from past success and mistakes. Please contact developer with any errors or bugs.  Thanks! @GardenSquared",

Worse than the limited user-friendliness, however,  is that I have upgraded to a new phone and have discovered that the app saves no memory of my garden bed information from my previous phone. With 72 total square feet of garden space,  I\\'m a little miffed about this and will now Seek a different app that allows data backup.",

I used Garden Tracker on my iPod touch and that\\'s a lot closer to what I\\'d be looking for in this type of app.  A few suggestions:  A plant database. It should include fields for plant category (vegetable, flower, herb), planting requirements (time, distance, depth), harvesting requirements and results, sun, etc.  Ability to add/edit/delete multiple plants at the same time, not just copy/paste one at a time. Very tiresome to add the same plant 8 times.  I\\'m out of room...",
