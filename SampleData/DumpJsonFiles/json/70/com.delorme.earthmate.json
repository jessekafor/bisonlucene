    "description": "5/10: This update addresses the Android 4.2 map rendering issue.With the Earthmate app for inReach, reach anyone, anywhere, anytime youâre outside of cell phone range. Earthmate allows you to turn your Android phone or tablet into a satellite communicator when paired with inReach, enabling you to access these exclusive features: send and receive text messages, follow me / find me tracking, trip history and track points, topographic maps and NOAA charts, and global SOS.Stay connected with family, share information with colleagues, or get emergency assistance anywhere on Earth.  Plus, youâll always receive a confirmation when your messages are delivered. You can also post messages to Facebook and Twitter and let others track your travels online.As an inReach owner, you also have exclusive, unlimited access through the Earthmate app to download DeLormeâs up-to-date topographic maps. Available for locations worldwide, the maps are cached on your mobile device, so they are viewable even when there is no cell phone signal. The display integrates with your mobile deviceâs GPS signal to pinpoint your location in a map context.For worry-free navigation, the inReach GPS signal â which is accurate to about 5 meters â is integrated with the map displays. Since navigation doesnât rely on the mobile deviceâs native GPS, there is less demand on its battery, which can be especially important in remote areas.NOTE: An inReach satellite communicator is required to use Earthmate and download maps. Maps should be downloaded via a WiFi connection prior to leaving on a trip. DeLormeâs global topographic maps include elevation contours, land cover, highways, streets and back roads, lakes and streams, places of interest, and trails. Features:Send and receive 160-character text messages via satellite (no cell signal required!)Interactive SOS lets you stay in touch with emergency response center, exchanging updates until help arrivesMessage delivery confirmation assures you that your message has reached the satellite for reliable delivery to cell phones, email, or emergency response centerTrip track points with GPS coordinates, speed, course and elevation display on a breadcrumb trail, which can be shared for others to view onlineTrip history stored within the app for easy reference.100% global satellite coverage through the Iridium satellite networkFor answers to common support questions: http://support.delorme.com/search.php?q=androidTo contact support:http://support.delorme.com/contact.php",

        "comment": "I went to my local Sportsmans Warehouse to get the newest SE(stand alone) version of the Inreach. Not available but Delorme Rep coming in the next day.  Met in person w/Delorme Rep,  assured me it would be on the store shelves in less than a week.  At that time there was a 50$ mail in rebate on the original Inreach.... 1 month later, still not in Stock, and by that time (I had to purchase for a trip), the mail in rebate had expired.  Essentially trusting the delorme rep cost me 50$. Incoming texts =1hr wait",

On the map downloads, just pay attention to the directions and select just what you need with the check boxes as they do take a little while to download. Delorme Developers, it sure would be nice to have the option of saving the maps to the SD card, only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars.",

Delorme\\'s customer service was excellent to work with.   In the little I\\'ve played with it there is only one of small item.  In chat format: If you send an InReach message to a 10 digit phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx). You will receive a reply in 11 (x-xxx-xxx-xxxx) digit phone number and it will not show up in chat format. This is easy to work around.",
