    "description": "Course to Steer, the sailing app which calculates your course to steer to compensate for tide, wind and magnetic compass errors.Check your chart-work before sailing by tapping into the app your intended ground track (or course to make good) along with your boat speed plus the set and rate of tidal stream. Your course to steer and speed over the ground are calculated instantly.Enter magnetic variation and deviation and your course to steer is converted from True to Magnetic to Compass bearing.Correct for Leeway, simply enter the wind direction and the course to steer will be corrected to counteract the wind.",
