        "comment": "Suggestions:  a) if I\\'m within 30 minutes of my boarding time, it would be nice if the app launched right to the boarding pass for my flight. There are too many clicks to get to the boarding pass when you want it.  b) it would be nice if the app could override screen timeout while I\\'m viewing the boarding pass. It seems inevitable that everyone in the security line times out just before the TSA is ready to look at the next person. Minor, but when you add it up over a lot of people in line, it might make a difference. (only really an issue at security lines btw. The gate agents are faster and it\\'s not a big problem there).   Other than that those few useful improvements, I love it. Thanks Delta.",

Really hoping that Delta reads through these comments and creates action items for their mobile development team to work through.  -- Even when my flight is delayed by 5 minutes, the app sends me through a process to choose an alternate flight even though I\\'m perfectly fine with being able to take the original flight.  Worst of all, it no longer shows me my original boarding pass.  Now I have to go to the gate agent an request a paper pass, so in essence the mobile app\\'s bug is causing more work for the Delta staff on the ground.  -- After checking in with the app (usually about 23-24 hours from departure when I get the notification), I usually want to see if the seat next to me is open or if I can change my seat.  Every time I try, I get the message along the lines that it \\\"cannot load the seat map at this time\\\" and it kicks me back to the main itinerary screen.  I then have to open my laptop in order to complete this process.",
