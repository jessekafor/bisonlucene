    "description": "The UV app has been created by the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) in partnership with the Met Office to provide the public with a free daily UV forecast for over 10,000 locations worldwide that can be accessed at the touch of your finger-tips. The UV forecast identifies the peak strength of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun at a particular place on a particular day. UV rays can cause damage to the skin and can cause sunburn â which may lead to skin cancer. The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) is the central association of practising UK dermatologists. The organisation aims to continually improve the treatment and understanding of skin disease, hence our slogan âHealthy Skin for Allâ. The BAD is committed to improving outcomes for skin cancer by promoting both the prevention and early detection of the disease. The Met Office is the UKâs national meteorological service, and is a Trading Fund within the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. The Met Office provides the most accurate and reliable weather information on TV and radio, in print, and online. Features: â¢Daily peak UV forecasts â¢In built geo-location to pin point your location and tell you what the corresponding UV level is on that day at your location â¢Find out what steps you need to take to protect yourself from over-exposure to the sun and the risks of sunburn and sun damage â¢Search function to find out the UV level in thousands of other locations across the UK and globally â¢Information about individual skin types (from very pale skin to naturally brown or black skin), and what this means in terms of the risks different UV levels pose to your skin type â¢Top tips on sun protection, including clothing, shade and what to look for in a sunscreen. More information: Find out more about sun protection and the early detection of skin cancer by visiting www.bad.org.uk/sunawareness Follow the BAD on twitter @HealthySkin4All Find out more about the Met Office, services provided, and weather forecasts by visiting www.metoffice.gov.uk Follow the Met Office on twitter @metofficeUK",
