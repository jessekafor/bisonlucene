    "description": "The Gardeners Calendar is the perfect gardening app for the gardener as it gives gardening advice and tips on all aspects of vegetable gardening. It also has a moon planting guide which is updated daily. Unlike other Gardening apps this app is not made up of links to websites or external documents, nor does it require you to register to unlock further content. What it contains is valuable guides to all sorts of gardening jobs like how to make your compost, or what is the 'Three Sisters gardening technique'. It also contains lots of information about the vegetable plants you want to grow, like the pH range of the soil, the type of soil etc.For seven years the Gardeners' Calendar has been providing a Moon Planting guide to gardeners around the world, and now you can take the guide with you on your mobile phone. Moon planting techniques have been used for thousands of years by farmers and gardeners. It helps you with the timings used for sowing, planting and harvesting your crops and therefore maximizes your yields.There is also loads of information about the vegetables you are going to grow including the soil types, pH values, best aspect, and germination temperature which work best for them.In this version the Moon Planting Guide provides seasonal advice to the Northern Hemisphere. The next version of the Guide will also support a seasonal sowing guide for the Southern hemisphere.",
