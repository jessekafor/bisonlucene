    "description": "Split Decision is the nonsense vs knowledge game. To win points, all you need to do is choose which of two categories something fits into, such as: Lasting Pride â Military Operation or Cat Litter? Breathe on Me â Britney Spears song or Sylvia Plath poem? REVIEWSa* âSplit Decision is an amazingly addictive gameâ â 9/10 Godisageek.com* âSplit Decision is perfect mobile gaming materialâ â Recommended Beefjack.com* âIf youâre the kind of person who likes to interject with obscure facts, then youâll love this.â Split-Screen.netFunny, fast-paced and addictive, Split Decision tasks you with choosing which of two unusual categories matches the subject youâve been given. Is Lasting Pride a Military Operation, or Cat Litter? Is Breathe on Me a Britney Spears song or a Sylvia Plath poem? Is Sobek an Egyptian God or a brand of anti-depressant? Unlike traditional quizzes, you donât need to be a trivia buff as youâve always got a 50% chance of getting a question right... but itâs kept challenging through multiple arcade-style game modes including timed countdown, three strikes and youâre out, and challenge, where famous historical figures set you goals. Whether youâre simply looking to expand your knowledge with the included trivia for each question, or take your place at the top of one of the high-score leaderboards, Split Decision is the kind of game that anyone willing to choose between two selections can enjoy. FEATURES* Based on the hugely popular board game Split Decision from mental_floss magazine!* Be challenged by some of the greatest minds from modern history! * Topical trivia included for every single questioning the game to help you learn while you have fun! * Choose between Quick, Deadly and Challenge game modes to suit how long you have to play! * Challenge your friends to answer some of the hilarious Split Decisions you discover! * Share your favourites questions via Facebook, Email, and Twitter to delight your friends! * Full Scoreloop leaderboards to try and top, and multiple inventive achievements to win!",

I didn\\'t see any wrong answers or grammatical errors. Also a good mix of topics. To those complaining about the lack of questions, why would a app developer give everything away for free. This is a taste to get you to buy the packs. Which leads me to my only complaint, how much are the add-on packs. It should say in game.",
