    "description": "Soccer Rotation, Substations, Coaching, Equal Play Time, Playing time If you have ever coached soccer team its chaotic enough trying to make sure the kids are in the right positions. You shouldnât have to worry if everyone is getting equal playing time. The Soccer Rotation Station will help to make sure that the kids are in the right position at the same time making sure that you donât have one kid spending too much on the sideline! The app vibrates and blows a whistle at you when itâs getting time to rotate your players, you then line them up and tell them who they are going in for and you wait. When the time is right, you send them in while pressing the rotate button and their off! Define Your own Positions Switch Positions (New) Set your own formations (5 vs 5, 6 vs 6 and so on) Substitute Players (New) Mark Goals and Assists for each player Add Blocks and Steals (New) Define your own positions Create your team and add your players on a website (By directional sync coming soon).

        "comment": "Near worthless unless the user can designate the position for each player so the substitution pulls from the designated position,  and not randomly. The other features are a good foundation, but I will not pay for this app with that feature missing.  If/When added,  I will gladly pay.",
