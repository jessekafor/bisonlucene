    "description": "Are you a composer looking for ideas? Or do you just enjoy listening to music? Fux lets you listen to an endless stream of continuously generated counterpoint music.FuX uses a Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm (VNS) to generate a continuous stream of fifth species counterpoint. Strict counterpoint is a formally defined musical style that originates in the 16th century. The rules of this style were written down by Fux in his book \"Gradus Ad Parnassum\" in 1725. This app generates a continuous stream of music that adheres to these rules as well as possible. The VNS algorithm used in FuX takes into account 19 melodic and 19 harmonic rules when evaluating the quality of the generated fragment. A detailed description of both these rules and the algorithm can be found in the publications available at http://antor.ua.ac.be/dorienherremansVersion 2.0 of FuX is able to generate counterpoint with composer-specific characteristics. These characteristics are based on models created by extracting features from an existing music database.More information about FuX can be found on the developer's website http://antor.ua.ac.be/FuX",
