        "comment": "Passed my test today in one go. However there were few questions which were not covered by this app directly/indirectly. One of them was about red and amber flashing lights on the motorway.  There are quite repetitive questions here.  Finally it doesn\\'t warn me if I select only one answer instead of supposedly two.  However it helped me built my foundation and majority of the questions in my test were from here. So thank you.",

But I guessed the right answer by association from   Many of the questions can get very repetitive and tedious: I\\'m not sure whether they should be considered differnent when the wording and order of answers is ever so slightly different: particularly when it is not verbative with what is on the test anyway.  But anyway, I found the revision I did with this app was invaluable in passing and now I hope I never have to think about Doctors\\' cars with green flashing lights or whether I should offer road accident victims a cigarette ever again.",
