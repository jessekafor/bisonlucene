For some reason, restaurant pages wouldn\\'t load, so I figured if try the app.  Worked flawlessly.  My only gripe is you can\\'t enter a tip amount manually.  You have to go in increments of 1%.  That leads to some very odd tip s, like $2.47 or $3.04 when I just want to use $2.50 or $3.00.  Other than that, perfect.  I happen to be using in Jersey City, NJ, so I get a TON of choices.",
