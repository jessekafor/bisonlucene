        "comment": "Whoever has done this, they have read my mind. I wanted this application to let people hear that I am busy and can not take their call (not send an auto-reply SMS). Its fantastic thinking by the developer of this application. However, I suggest some improvements such as... 1. The person calling should not be hearing everything that is happening over with me. As of now, this app answers the caller, plays the mp3 file but also is open to the caller to listen what is going on around my place. This need to be controlled and improved. 2. It would be great if the caller can leave a voice mail that can be stored as a file on my phone, instead of calling the voice-mail service!!",
