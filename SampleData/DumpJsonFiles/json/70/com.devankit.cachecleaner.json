Why should clear the cache?In the android phone, cache files are stored in the phone internal memory (ROM), the phone internal memory is different from the SD card, you can think cache is computer memory and SD card is hard drive, one fast and another slow.Because the internal phone storage capacity is fixed, if you don't clear in time, the cache will be larger and larger, and finally running out of internal phone storage.3 Will clear the application's data while clear the cache?A: The application's data is different with cache, cache is temporary storage of files, used and no longer valid; but application's data will be used later, such as games record and user information.
