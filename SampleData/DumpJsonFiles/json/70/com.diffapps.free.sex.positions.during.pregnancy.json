    "description": "She's carrying your child, the next in your line, your heir. Hopefully, you're both overjoyed. Congrats! Now the question remains: Are you supposed to take a vow of celibacy for the next nine months, or can you still have sex!?Luckily, you can have lots and lots of sex, as long as she's game and doesn't have any special medical complications. So here are the extra concerns to keep in mind when you have sex with your (or someone else's) pregnant woman. And there's actually a good chance that she'll love sex more during pregnancy. Increased blood flow to the pelvic area can make her genitals extremely sensitive and heighten her sensations during sex.",
