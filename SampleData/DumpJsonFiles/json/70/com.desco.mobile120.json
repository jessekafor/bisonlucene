And if you lose data connectivity you cant access the list of calls on the phone and the tech has to either drive around looking for signal or call the office to get the information. Too expensive for what it offers. Also, will attach pictures from camera only, you cant upload from file. Big minus.",

        "comment": "This is a big program that\\'s not just the mobile app.  Pros: totally syncs w/ Quickbooks, good customer service & support, has the ability to process credit cards from the software/app (if you use MerchantWarehouse who did save us $) once everything is set up it\\'s a good program (not great, just good).  Cons: It\\'s expensive, takes a while to get set up, has A LOT of idiosyncrasies in the software, the app side isn\\'t as full function as the desktop side, doesn\\'t automatically alert tech that they have a new dispatch.  I would say this software is good for a small-ish service company that already has some things in place like Quickbooks but needs a better dispatching & mobile invoicing option. I suggest it but only to people that can take the time to learn a whole new system almost on their own. Ya there is training provided, but I didn\\'t feel that it was very through.  I worked with the system till I found a road block then called support & asked my specific question. I consider myself very tech savvy, & it still took a while to learn. We\\'ve had the system for 3 months & there are still things I don\\'t know how to do or have fully set up.",

Sure we\\'ve had our issues with it but most of those issues were from not fully understanding the program or its capability\\'s. One of the most important things is to have a real good cell phone provider that can provide good quality data service. Not just phone service but DATA service! We did much research on this when we made the change to mobile and by far Verizon had the best service in our area of Northeast PA. This App has streamlined our operation and I am sure the folks at ESC will make it even better!",

Version 13 for the laptop needs to have the ability to display quotes for the customer and have them sign at bottom. Then you should also be able to convert the quote into an invoice on the spot. This should all happen without internet connection.  The desktop software you cant even detach the calendar, so you can talk to the customer about scheduling as your setting up their dispatch.  One other thing that sucks about ESC is the fact you can\\'t create non inventory parts to make sure your parts pricing can get updated. Which in turn can update your price books.  I will stop here or I will go on all day with things that are lacking in ESC mobile and desktop software.  This software is not worth the money at this point.",

Me and the guys sometimes have to power cycle the entire phone because the app won\\'t work (rare but happens). When entering equipment, they make you enter area served, filter and belt info on a seperate screen for some unknown reason and the button to this is extremely close to the big \\\"save\\\" button so instead you save it. This extra step makes entering equipment tedious and time consuming instead of quick as saving takes a long time in areas without LTE service. Why the extra screen? LOOOONG time.  We use Thunderbolt or Galaxy Nexus. Other than that, the app is great ;-)",
