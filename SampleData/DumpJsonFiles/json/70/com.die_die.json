    "description": "Die of the Death is a dice game where you are not allowed to roll a six. The goal is to reach 50 points by rolling dice. If it is your turn: roll like mad! Your turn score is added up by every die you roll. Save your points if you are satisfied, since a six cancels your turn and your current points transform into dust. Play versus a friend, a fiend or the computer.Network access is required as it is made with phonegap.Features:â No ads!â Single- and multiplayerâ Smartphone and tablet readyâ Choose your own score limit",
