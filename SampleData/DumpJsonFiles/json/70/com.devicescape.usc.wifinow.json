    "description": "Welcome to the Wi-Fi Now application from U.S. CellularÂ® ! This is a free service that gives you access to the worldâs largest network of qualified Wi-Fi hotspots.  Wi-Fi Now automatically connects your device to select public and amenity Wi-Fi hotspots and helps you save on mobile data usage. Additionally, Wi-Fi Now tests the hotspots for functionality and will only connect to quality hotspots. Once set-up, Wi-Fi Now operates in the background â no user action is required. Wi-Fi Now makes connecting to Wi-Fi networks convenient and easy. Wi-Fi Now adds to the native Android connection managerâs capability by identifying which hotspots to connect to and, more importantly, how to connect to them.  For example, many public hotspots require a user to launch their device browser and tap on an âacceptâ button (or other manual steps) on a web page before they get a working Wi-Fi connection. Wi-Fi Now takes care of these steps automatically for millions of qualified public and amenity Wi-Fi hotspots.Wi-Fi Now is designed to have negligible impact on battery life when compared to an equivalent device that has Wi-Fi enabled.  If you notice a change, it may be because your data consumption is increasing and/or because the screen is enabled more often. Using Wi-Fi Now ensures the maximum benefit can be obtained from having Wi-Fi enabled and is strongly recommended.To learn more about Wi-Fi Now and how we have addressed many of the questions and requests in the User Review section of Google Play, please see the following URL:  www.uscellular.com/smartphones/apps/wifinow.htmlNot compatible with the following devices:â¢ Samsung Acclaimâ¢ HTC Desireâ¢ LG Apexâ¢ LG Optimusâ¢ LG Genesisâ¢ Samsung i100 â Gem",

Can\\'t uninstall from my Galaxy S4 either. Bloatware. Awful.",
