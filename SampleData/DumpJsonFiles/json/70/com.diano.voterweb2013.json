Any such access will be blocked or terminated upon detection.- This app may collect device information including, but not limited to, device phone number.- This is necessary to maintain security, identify users, allow me to proactively contact users, and block users violating any of my terms of use (previously stated or not).- VoterWeb is the most up-to-data online voter data resource in PA for Democrats and progressive grassroots activists.",
