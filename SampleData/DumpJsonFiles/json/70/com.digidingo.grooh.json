        "comment": "The game itself is great, interesting puzzle game that requires you to think not just tap the screen repeatedly.  It would be a five star game if you could make it more stable as it seems to crash often. Also please add a \\\"replay level\\\" option once a level is complete to make it easier to try for a better score. Good work guys!",
