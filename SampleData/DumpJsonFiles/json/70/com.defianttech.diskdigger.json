Whether you accidentally deleted a photo, or even reformatted your memory card, DiskDigger's powerful data recovery features can find your lost pictures and let you restore them, or send them to an email account.For complete instructions, please see http://diskdigger.org/androidAgain, this app is for rooted devices only! This is also a work-in-progress app (and not nearly as powerful as the original DiskDigger for Windows), so all constructive feedback and requests for features are welcome!",

        "comment": "My first app to get root access and it worked brilliantly. I rooted my phone today. One hour later I recovered all photos my little brother had deleted. Nice app. I think the app should scan a little faster and that the dev should work on the speed of the app. Also video recovery is not working well. I would like to know how the app works so developers please enlighten me.",

There are many other application and softwares out there BUT almost all require paid license to recover your deleted photo. THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE AND ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. A free software i downloaded from the internet took 4 hours to finish scanning through my Galaxy Note 2, and this app only took 10-15minutes.  One tiny problem is that not the entire photo is recovered, some corners or edges get cut away, but at least the photos are recovered.  TO THE DEVELOPERS, THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH!!!",
