Pretty neat. but it was short lived because there is a routine choppy cut sound where the tracks seam is and it causes my awareness to jolt back into normal consciousness. Maybe its placed there to make us aware that we are dreaming, but I doubt it. Totally ruins a good trip for me. Please smooth out this sound glitch. Thx",
