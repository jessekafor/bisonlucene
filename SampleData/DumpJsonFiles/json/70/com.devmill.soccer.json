    "description": "If you have ever coached soccer team its chaotic enough trying to make sure the kids are in the right positions.  You shouldnât have to worry if everyone is getting equal playing time.  The Soccer Rotation Station will help to make sure that the kids are in the right position at the same time making sure that you donât have one kid spending too much on the sideline!  The app vibrates and blows a whistle at you when itâs getting time to rotate your players, you then line them up and tell them who they are going in for and you wait.  When the time is right, you send them in while pressing the rotate button and their off!Define Your own PositionsSwitch Positions (New)Set your own formations (5 vs 5, 6 vs 6 and so on)Substitute Players (New)Mark Goals and Assists for each playerAdd Blocks and Steals (New)Define your own positionsCreate your team and add your players on a website (By directional sync coming soon).

        "comment": "Until you can dictate your own rotation this app is not what we really need.   No coach is going to use some random rotation beyond U6 if even that.  First step is the ability to assign player to position(s) and then rotate only with players in their position, i. e.  midfielder for midfielder.   Ultimately,  the ideal app would allow a coach to designate the entire rotation in pre-game then when it comes time for subs the app let\\'s the coach know who is going in for who.",

        "comment": "I agree with Nick, I have kids with 7 years soccer experience and others who are relatively new to soccer and each kid has their own strength, however I need the ability to put players where I think they would be the best strength for the team.  This would be great if you could put players in groups such as forwards, mids, defenders and then it would rotate based on the groups. So I could rotate and who was playing as a forward can also rotate to a defender, but if a player is strongest as a defender, the app would not rotate and put them as a striker/forward.  Thanks...almost there, I am looking forward to the next release but until then I have to keep searching.",

Probably need to make the font used by the app smaller or suppress decorum so that all fit on the screen. For example the 4th screenshot above is not what I have. the bottom players names are cut off",

It would be a 5 star for us with the following modifications: Goalies tend to rotate by half in our league so being able to define a pool of Goalies per game and then rotate them based on the length of the game. Second is to predefine postitions by game. The ideal would be to define a players primary position and secondary list of positions that player is eligible in rotation. Make it work for 5 stars.",

That has proven to be the most challenging part of coaching, but not with this app!  It even reminds you that it\\'s almost time to rotate (based on your settings of how early to remind you) so you can warn the players to be ready to rotate in soon.  The app is very customizable - allowing you to add custom positions, team and player names, games, amount of players present to play, etc.  EVERY COACH NEEDS THIS APP!",
