They are really four broke dudes iin a room that make money from tricking people into taking two surveys then never giving another one. After that, they record your phone calls, bank pin, address, websites visited, and display them to the public and over facebook. One threatened to kill me when I contacted him. I then explained that I was a huge landscaper that could probably throw him further than a 200 lb bag of fertalizer. He hasnt contacted me since..",
