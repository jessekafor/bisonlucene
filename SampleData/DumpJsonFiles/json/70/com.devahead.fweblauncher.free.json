    "description": "Do you enjoy using Facebook website? Would you like to get the best of it by using both the Mobile and the full Desktop version? If the answer is yes, then FWebLauncher (Facebook Web Launcher) is the right app for you!MAIN FEATURES:- use the Facebook full desktop website like on your PC or Mac- switch ON THE FLY between the Mobile and the Desktop version of Facebook (choose the one you like the most and switch to the other anytime if you need it)- open Facebook in your web browser (WB launch mode) or in the internal FWebLauncher browser (FWL launch mode) for an easier interaction- tabbed browsing in the internal FWebLauncher browser (FWL launch mode)- save your favorite Facebook links for a quick access (are you checking a Page or a Profile frequently to have information about an event or keep in touch with a friend? Just save a link to them for immediate access!)- HTTPS encryption support (if it doesn't work for you, disable it in the \"Settings\" screen)NOTE:- FWebLauncher works best with the standard Android web browser or with Dolphin browser in the WB launch mode- it is recommended to watch the video guide to learn how FWebLauncher works (watch it in HQ, it's an HD video)- some links in the desktop version of Facebook might not be available in the mobile one because the Facebook platform doesn't make available all the features in the mobile version- FWebLauncher is free, but ad-supportedPERMISSIONS DESCRIPTION:- INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: used by the internal web browser (FWL launch mode) and to display the ads- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: used to write the internal browser cache on the SD or to write other settings files- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: used to get the device position to allow Facebook check-ins in the internal web browser (you can disable the position tracking in the \"Settings\" screen)- WAKE_LOCK: used by the internal web browser (FWL launch mode) while playing a video to keep the screen onSUPPORT:- if something is not working in the internal web browser (FWL launch mode), try the same thing with another web browser and if there's still a problem, it might be a temporary Facebook issue- for any kind of problem or question, just send a feedback e-mail to the developer through the Android Market or with the specific button inside the appCOPYRIGHT:- Facebook is a trademark of Facebook, Inc.- this app is not made by Facebook, Inc., it's just an utility for Facebook users- the best effort has been made to respect all the copyright requirements, but in case you think there are some violations, just send an e-mail to the developer",
