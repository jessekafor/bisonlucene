    "description": "Demo version of this very popular brain training game, similar to the numbers round from the TV show. The goal is to get near a chosen random number using the four basic arithmetic operations (x + - /), applied to six numbers chosen randomly. Partial calculations are shown on the screen, and are reusable too. This mathematics game is always able to calculate the better solution, that will be shown in case you don't get it. It includes an original score system, a help screen and a direct link to buy the paid version.The demo version has only one basic and easy level.The paid version features more backgrounds, music, sounds, tablet design, and three difficulty levels, including timeouts.",
