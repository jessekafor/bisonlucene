Phrase Party! guaranteed to bring even the biggest party poopers come to life and join the fun. â Rated The #3 Application on the App Store by toptentopten.com â Rated one of the top 6 Party Games by techbu.com â \"It makes the party entertaining and full of life.\" -- Techbu.com â \"Its a great way to get your friends together and have some fun\" -- DayFly.com What is Phrase Party? ----------- Phrase Party is a simple but exciting game where you try to describe a phrase that appears on the screen to your teammates by using words, not gestures. You pass the device around until the timer goes off and the person holding the device loses. Phrase Party! is beautiful, simple to use, super fun and packed with features that other, similar apps can only dream of.

Choose one category, mix and match, or pick 'Everything' to use them all. - Sports - Entertainment - Science - Places - Food - World - Sayings â EXPANSION PHRASE PACKS: Play with amazing and hilarious expansion categories that you can buy.- Adult- College- Tha Streetz - Vampire Sagas - Tis the Season - Stars and Stripes â CUSTOMIZATION: Add your own phrases and phrase categories. Share them with your friends. Set your timer length, play with up to 4 teams, set team names and more. â GREAT INTERFACE: A clean, beautiful interface that you will feel right at home using. â NO REPEATS: or spelling errors. I promise. I have recently responded to user feedback and completely redesigned this app to provide a better User Experience in version 2.0. Please keep this in mind as you browse older app reviews.------ Although The rules and game play in Phrase Party!'s classic mode are very similar to that of Catch Phraseâ¢ by Hasbro Inc., Catch Phraseâ¢ is a registered trademark of Hasbro Inc. This product is in no way affiliated or endorsed by Hasbro and should not be confused with their product, Catch Phraseâ¢.",

It\\'s the only pure Google designed phone from the ground up, including pure Android build, so I expect more quality.",
