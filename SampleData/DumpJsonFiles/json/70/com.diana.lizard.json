        "comment": "I love this app!  We tried it with my wife and it was a lot of fun. The app has very user friendly interface and is simple in use. It allows to compare different features (eyes, ears, mouth, ...) of a baby with parents. Before this app we could not do this cause in the moment we could see only two of us :-)  It was surprisingly how different can be baby\\'s features:  1) my daughter\\'s earss are the same as mine but we have never compared them earlier; 2) the same thing is with fingers: daughter\\'s middle finger is longer that forefinger! My ones are the same but my wife has quite the opposite forefinger longer.  Thanks for the app!",
