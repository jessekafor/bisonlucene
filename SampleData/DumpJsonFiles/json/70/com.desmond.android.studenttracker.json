    "description": "Attention!!!!  MTC Free is being replaced by MTC Lite.  It's still free and has everything you love about MTC Free.  It's also got a new updated design and looks great on phones and tablets.  Please head over to Music Teacher's Companion Lite at play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.desmond.android.mtclite for the updated design.  This application will eventually disappear from the market and I'll stop adding enhancements to it so please use the new Music Teacher's Companion Lite instead.To move your data over to MTC Lite, simply update to the latest version, then go to the backup section of the preferences and select \"Export to MTC Lite\".  Then open MTC Lite and select \"Import from MTC Free\" from the backup section of the preferences.  All your data should transfer.  Please let me know if you have issues with the transfer, I'm happy to help.",
