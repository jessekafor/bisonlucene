        "comment": "This game reminds me of when I was a kid, it is great to actually have this as an application on my phone, and its free what more can I ask for!  I do like the apps added functionality of lives, it gives the opportunity to play games longer especially after making silly mistakes.   I can monitor how much better I am getting at remembering sequences by entering my scores after a game!  Thank you!",
