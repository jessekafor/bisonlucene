Please add some widgets or something to make it worth the money ! Also grades options could be improved  *Edit* apparently the developers cannot be found and no updates have happened since 2011 .. not sure a paid app should be allowed on the market when the developer disappears",

An easier way to enter info would also be nice, as the desktop program never worked very well for me, and typing in all of my categories, classes, and other fiddly bits is tiresome.  However, it is still an excellent app for keeping track of your classes and has a widget to monitor your due tasks.  Droid X CM7GB.",

It says you there is a tool on the developer\\'s website, but that site is no longer available.  Being able to sync across devices would be nice.  I plan to use my tablet a lot for school, but it would be nice if my phone was upto date as well, so I don\\'t have to pull out the tablet just to check what is coming up next.  If I were to write an app to track my progress in school, it would be very much like this one.  This is the best app I have found so far, just a few things that could be better.",
