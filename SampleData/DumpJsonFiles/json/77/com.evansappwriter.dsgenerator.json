    "description": "The Desire Statement Generator walks you through the process of writing a powerful Desire Statement, which is a super charged affirmation focused on manifesting a desire in your life.  This process is part of the very successful Habit of Attraction teaching created by Robert Evans, founder of The Messenger Network.  The DS Generator will take you through 12 steps to focus in on a particular desire and once completed that desire statement will be on the main screen of your app so each time you open it, you'll be reminded to read and connect with it.  The app also has a reminder alarm to remind you to read it each day.",
