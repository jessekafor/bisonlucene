    "description": "Tracking a major event such as a key launch date, a major organizational change event and so on helps bring together teams by building up the excitement and the positive tension it generates.  Even for personal events such as a wedding or a holiday travel, a countdown to the event increases the excitement.  As a result the countdown acts as a tool to sharpen the focus on tasks to be accomplished so that the the event being tracked will be executed successfully.This application helps you count down towards two events.  They could be the final event or milestones leading up to the major event.A widget could be added to get summary of the events, which is updated hourly.The progress bar and the date/time counters together show the time elapsed since the event is defined and remaining time for the âdeadlineâ. No alert, alarm or popup is given when the counter reaches the final date/time. User has to specify the event name, date and time and then press \"Start\" to start the counter. Whenever the Date/Time is edited, user has to press the \"Start\" button again to effect the new date/time. Maximum of two events can be active at any time. Events within ONE year period only can be defined.Note: In order to keep the app 100% free, you will receive the following âSearch shortcut icon on your home screen,Search shortcut on your bookmarks and browser homepage.This will help us bring you more cool apps like this in the future.You can delete the search shortcuts easily (Drag & Drop to the garbage), this will not affect the application in any way.",
