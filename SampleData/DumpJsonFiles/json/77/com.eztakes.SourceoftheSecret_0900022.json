    "description": "The Source of the Secret is a provocative look at the teachings of The Secret through the eyes of some of the worldâs leading and most influential teachers, authors and thinkers.  Oral Roberts, John Bevere and Dr. Ben Johnson all make an appearance and discuss their thoughts on what The Source of the Secret can bring to each of our lives.  Through their insights, youâll be encouraged to look beyond The Secret to the actual source of its core principles. A better life really does lie within your grasp ... but to find it, you must discover the Source.",
