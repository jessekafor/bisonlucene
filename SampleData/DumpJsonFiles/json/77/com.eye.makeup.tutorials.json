It is commonly used to make the wearer's eyes stand out or look more attractive.It adds depth and dimension, complements the eye color, or simply draws attention to them. Shadow comes in many different colors and textures. It is usually made from a powder and mica, but can also be found in liquid, pencil, or mousse form.Civilizations across the world use it - predominantly on females, but also occasionally on males. In Western society, it's seen as a feminine cosmetic, even when used by men. On average, the distance between eyelashes and eyebrows is twice as big in women as in men. Thus pale shadow visually enlarges this area and has a feminizing effect. In Gothic fashion, black or similarly dark-colored shadow is popular amongst both genders.Many people use shades simply to improve their appearance, but it is also commonly used in theatre and other plays, to create a memorable look, with bright and even ridiculous colors. Depending on skin tone and experience, the effect usually brings out glamour and gains attention. It attempts to replicate the natural shadow that some women exhibit due to a natural contrasting pigmentation on their eyelids. Natural shade can range anywhere from a glossy shine to one's eyelids, to a pinkish tone, or even a silver look.It can be applied in a variety of ways depending upon the desired look and formulation. Typically application is done using fingers or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eyeshadow, and makeup in general, is blending well.While it is frequently used to shade or âshadowâ the eyes, it is also used to lighten, brighten, and make them appear larger. Many different types of enhancements can be achieved through different uses of color, shading, and blending techniques.Many popular eye shadows come in powdered form and contain talc, but there are also cream and liquid shadows. Cream shadows should be used above the crease of the eye and are not recommended for the area below the eye, as they can develop a crepe-like texture, adding years to the appearance. Liquid for creates a \"wet\" or shimmering appearance and both cream and liquid shadows work well as a base for powdered one.The traditional way to use it is to apply different shades from one corner of the eye to the other, blending from light to dark. Starting with light colors from the inside corner and blending to dark will make them appear farther apart and larger. Keep in mind that light colors are used to highlight and accent the shape of the eye, while dark colors are used to shade and gently change the shape.To remove it, a commercial remover can be utilized, though a rich face wash will usually remove all traces of color. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using baby oil. There are also wipes that can be used.",
