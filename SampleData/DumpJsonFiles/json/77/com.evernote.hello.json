        "comment": "This app is the only thing that made my transition from IOS to Android less than perfect. This app is quite lagging in functionality with regards to its IOS counterpart, namely no means by which to scan a business card and the Linkedin profile picture connection is not as user-friendly.  Waiting for Evernote to deliver on promises in their blog to make this app equivalent to its iOS counterpart, for over 4 months....have now lowered my rating to 1*.",
