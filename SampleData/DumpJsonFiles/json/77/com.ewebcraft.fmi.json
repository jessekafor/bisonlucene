    "description": "The Franklin Mutual Insurance Company has been in business since 1879, making us one of the oldest and most experienced insurance companies in New Jersey. Although we are the largest mutual insurance company headquartered in New Jersey, we are not a large conglomerate. By being smaller, we can offer you the personal service you need and desire.To accommodate our customers as the world becomes more mobile, we've developed this application that will allow them to file property, liability, worker's compensation, and identity theft claims directly from their mobile device.  Additionally, they'll also be able to locate an agent that's based in the same geographical area.  Let's face it, most times when you're in need of immediate assistance from your insurance agent, you're not near a computer and only have your mobile device to use.  By using the FMI Mobile Claim App, we're putting the power of Franklin Mutual Insurance right in our customers' fingertips.",
