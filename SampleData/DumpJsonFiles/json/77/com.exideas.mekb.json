        "comment": "Just absolutely adore this keyboard. Suggestion: when in landscape mode & after splitting the keyboard to the sides, there\\'s empty space in the middle? Cud you add something to that space? Like a regular qwerty w/ sliding/swype functionality? (word prediction still isn\\'t that good on messagease). then. W/ both \\\"style\\\" keyboards, it would be the best of both worlds! Atleast until you incorporate word predictive \\\"sliding\\\" technology to the messagease layout. Tnx! Either way more power!",

Copy and past functions and commands such as hold for numbers, drag or spin for capital letters and \\\"arrow-like\\\" movement on spacebar and the right letters are fantastic!",

TIME FOR THE GOVT TO BAN THE QWERT KEYBOARD.........................i strongly suggest everyone to download this keyboard,its game and english pack and STOP FOLLOWING THE CROWD........and i learned that the design is patented and based on a study on human response and brain",

I kept blaming my chubby fingers and I tried other keyboards.  Nothing worked. Then I tried MessageEase.  I knew that I needed a little  practice time to get used to it.  But honestly, I only stumbled around for the first 2 days.  And I am now super fast & error free.  It\\'s way faster than  QWERTY & it\\'s customizable so you can swap characters you use more often in place of those you don\\'t.  Also, customer service is A+++.",

Worse, my stock keyboard has tiny keys, which makes me mess up everything. This keyboard solves all the problems, and improves my speed (with requisite practice, obviously). HIGHLY recommend this keyboard for anyone with similar problems, and even in general, for it\\'s terrific speed. I will note the landscape version is not very good on my S3, so I use a separate manager to force another keyboard in landscape.",
