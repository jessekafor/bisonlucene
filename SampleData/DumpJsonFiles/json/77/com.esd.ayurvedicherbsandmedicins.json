        "comment": "Well, this has to be the worst app I have tried. I have a few hundred installed.  The interface is almost unusable (I have a nexus 4). It has no menu system. You have to scroll through oversized thumbnails with the herb name under them. It does something very odd when I try to select a herb and ends up selecting a completely different one. There is no search option.  Even if it were possible to view the herb I want to select, the info does not include any ayurvedic data. Nothing on the doshas for instance.",
