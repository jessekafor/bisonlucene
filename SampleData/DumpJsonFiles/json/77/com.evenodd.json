        "comment": "Literally, it\\'s not a game for gamers but it\\'s best way to engage some one. (off-topic)Believe it or not whenever i want to get rid of my nephew for a while i give this game to him and ask him to score 3400.  1. Graphics are simple and up to limitation. 2. Sound, used a retro ding sound if you win a point.. nothing unique. 3. Score 100 points for correct answer -100 for wrong. 4. (Best thing i like)The game holds time trial challenge and you have to score within a definite time limit.  why it deserves 5, the app is bug free so far simple and educational for certain age people or rather say kids.
