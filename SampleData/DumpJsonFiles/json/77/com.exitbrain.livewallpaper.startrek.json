        "comment": "This is a fantastic app, nothing out there is better! However, what I would like to see in future updates is the ability to program the buttons to open folders instead of just individual apps.   EDIT: I just upgraded to the Nexus 7 (2013) and this wallpaper now runs so slow? Which doesn\\'t make sense in my head, this device has twice the RAM and a faster processor then my old tablet. So I\\'m not sure what to do about it? Please fix if possible? I love this app. Maybe it\\'s just not optimized for 4.3 JB yet?",

Adding more options for the moving display screen would be cool, really dig the starfield & particle accelerator though so far!
