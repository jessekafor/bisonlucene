On my phone they showed to be 20\\302\\260 off (easterly) from where they really were. This was using the moon as a reference. But, Sky Maps is very accurate, so it\\'s not my phone.

Emailed the developer about the whole situation and had every point shot down by apples to oranges comparisons. Sadly I can\\'t rate the devs directly, so their choices will have to be reflected in my rating. As for the app itself...The current version is pleasing to look at, AR and night mode are two awesome features of this app. However, orientation of the phone, i.e. looking at the stars, seems to be inaccurate a decent amount of the time for me. I use this app while operating one of the largest telescopes on the east coast and it seems to disagree with the telescope software for quite a few minutes after loading this app. Also not sure I agree with their decisions of making planets look like stars in the \\\"sky\\\" and having the Sun, which is a star, under the planets list, as this is an \\\"education\\\" app. I\\'d give the app 3 stars for its features and interface, but 1 star to the devs ideals and lack of consideration for their supporters.",
