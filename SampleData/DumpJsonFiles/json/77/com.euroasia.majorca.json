    "description": "The largest and most popular of the Balearics, Majorca is an island of startling contrasts. Its landscape varies from rugged mountains in the north to pine-covered hills and windmill-dotted plains in the south. In the west, the historic and elegant capital, Palma, skirts an attractive harbour while in the east, you can explore pretty, secluded sandy coves. Despite great popularity and development, Majorca remains an astonishingly beautiful place, with verdant pines, rolling green hills, endless superb beaches and a varied choice of resorts, each with a character and flavour of its own. Whether you want to sun yourself in peace and quiet or live it up in the hot spots until the early hours, Marjorca has just the resort for you.Our Majorca/Mallorca Island Mobile Application gives you full access to Majorca/Mallorca Island which is part of the Balearic Islands in Spain.The Application gives you general infos, a photo library, Hotels in Majorca/Mallorca Island, Google Satellite Maps for Majorca/Mallorca Island and as well the Balearic Islands.We also included a Majorca/Mallorca Island Travel Guide and a navigational compass.This application is compatible from Android Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, and the latest Jelly Bean.",
