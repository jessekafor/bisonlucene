This app does everything your regular remote can and all sorts of other stuff.If you're having any trouble, PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE RATING. I can't respond to reviews or comments, so if you contact me I can help you out and I know what to change in the next version. Your feedback really does help! This app uses free icons from androidicons.com.â Find and connect to your player in less than 10 seconds without having to manually enter its address - even works with players connected over wifi!â Roku ECP - way more reliable than the old Telnet protocol some other remote apps useâ Full 12-button control including Back and Instant Replayâ List and launch channels directly from your phoneâ Automatically jump to search screens using your phone's search buttonâ Enter text on your phone and send it to the player - never use the on-screen letter picker again!Known issues:â Search and enter text features don't always work with Hulu. This is unfortunately their fault and I can't do anything to work around it.â Some Honeycomb devices are unable to use this app.Roku Inc. does not endorse (or have anything else to do with) this app.For Roku streaming video players only. Not intended for SoundBridge devices.Support further development of this app by purchasing the pro version and enjoy an ad-free experience!http://goo.gl/V44pD",
