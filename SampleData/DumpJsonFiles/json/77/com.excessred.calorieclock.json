    "description": "Calorie Clock is a simple, effective weight loss tool.This app was originally developed to help me count calories, but it helped me so much, I thought I should share it with you!Most health and fitness tools come with a bunch of unnecessary features. My goal was to make Calorie Clock a simple and effective calorie counter that didn't have any of the clutter of most weight loss applications.Calorie Clock helps you lose weight and stay fit without draining your battery!You start by setting a daily calorie intake goal for yourself.Your 'Calorie Clock' will increase passively throughout the day. Whenever you eat, click the \"I Ate Something\" button to reduce your available calories.Keeping track of calories this way encourages eating big breakfasts and spreading your meals throughout the day.As long as you keep your available calories above zero, you're losing weight. Simple as that!Keeping track of calories used to be a chore, but not anymore!Upcoming features:  - Calorie Clock widget!  - \"I Exercised\" feature.",

Really excited for the \\\"I excersized\\\" part. Suggested improvement: a widget would be awesome just the amount of calories and than a + and - numbers.  Thank you!!",
