I wish experimenting with background color was easier than removing widget and adding again. Note: for new android versions go to widgets tab in apps to add to home screen.",

Very nice widget. However, being stuck with only the 4 options is tough. My only suggestion would be is to also have a single block widget that you can customize. That would push me to 5 stars.",

        "comment": "So useful. I can just hand my phone to someone and ask them to add their own new contact information. And it auto-capitalizes the first letter of first and last name. I couldn\\'t find another widget that did that...  Paul Hallett\\'s Quick Add was a comparable runner up with a more integrated \\\"Text Back\\\" feature, and really cool looking single button \\\"Quick Add\\\" widget, but no auto caps and common looking UX\\342\\200\\223so I couldn\\'t give that one to a client to \\'add\\' into.  Great job Widgeton! Clean! Sophisticated look. And I happen to really need a quick event adder and an instant note app! So I\\'m hooked now and I won\\'t do without it! Will you tell me though, how do I activate the instant SMS feature?",
