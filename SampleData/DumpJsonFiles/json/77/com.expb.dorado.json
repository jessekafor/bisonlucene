        "comment": "This is a very simple clone of the many games like it with the exception that you\\'re a wagon rather than a motorcycle. You get stuck easily and the controls have a lot to be desired. The only redeeming point is there are a few things that you\\'ll get a chuckled from, like the reference to the donner party.",

        "comment": "If you\\'ve ever played the real Oregon Trail (on old computers with floppy disks) then you\\'ll appreciate this game. I see that the MECC (Minnesota Education Computing Consortium) was involved in this. They were the creators of the original game. I\\'m not sure if they sold the \\\"Oregon Trail\\\" naming rights long ago, which is why there are crappy pay-to-play versions in the market and this one is called something else. Anyway, the point is that this one won\\'t ask you to purchase 30 whatevers to enhance gameplay",

        "comment": "Not at all what I expected, maybe that\\'s my own fault for not looking into this app a little further before I purchased it. Basically you\\'re driving your wagon over mountains flying from mountain top to mountain top doing flips and landing upside down 90% of the time causing broken limbs and eventually death. Nothing even close to the original Oregon Trail as I was hoping for. Again my fault for not doing my research but you\\'ve been warned.",

        "comment": "... and, if you pay attention, you might even learn something.   Roger Ebert once notoriously said that video games are not art. Clearly, he has never played \\\"So Long Oregon.\\\"   There have been other video games that try to simulate the hardships of life on the Oregon Trail; for example, there is \\\"The Oregon Trail.\\\" That game, unfortunately, is known for its historical inaccuracy, in addition to a complete lack of sweet jumps and crazy flying snake physics. This game rectifies all of these issues, thus providing the most accurate and entertaining rendition of life on the trail in video game form to date.   In conclusion: you should buy this game. It\\'s pretty rad.",
