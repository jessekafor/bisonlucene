    "description": "â Love Conquers All, Even in Video GamesNobody ever claimed love is easy. \"Trace me!\" is a perfect illustration of this truth. You play a little boy who wishes to show his love to girlfriend Jenny. You must run, hop, and jump over increasingly difficult levels to reach your soul mate.â Make Your Own Path\"Trace me!\" is a very unique game. Unlike most jump and avoid the obstacles games, \"Trace me!\" allows you to draw your own track towards the goal. You draw paths and platforms with your finger as you collect what Jenny asks for (she apparently has a fondness for diamonds and shoes). You can also erase your track if need be. But getting to Jenny isn't as easy as it sounds. Standing between you and your love is a host of obstacles, including buzzsaws, scissors, and falling rocks.â Sometimes Even True Love Needs a Little Help!Kids and adults will both enjoy this challenging, lighthearted game. There is no \"lives\" system, so you can play a level as many times as you need until you can beat it. If you do find yourself stuck, sneak a peek at the YouTube videos to see how you can draw yourself to victory. Do you have what it takes to make Jenny love you?â Make Jenny love you!â FULL & FREE*!â Unique arcade & puzzle type game.â Draw platforms with your finger and collect what Jenny asks.   â Enjoy 50 unique level designed from easy to hard. - Ad supportedkeywords: jenny, my love jenny, love, trace, trace me, puzzle, unique, best, fun, kid, kids, draw, drawing, hand, hand drawing, painting, paint",
