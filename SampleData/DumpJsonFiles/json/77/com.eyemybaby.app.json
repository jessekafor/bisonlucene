    "description": "A sleeping baby is like an angel. Eye My Baby monitors your little angel and informs you via Call, Email or Notification when your baby's sleep is disturbed or plays Lullaby or Parent's Message. If youâre kind of a parent who wants her baby to sleep nicely as well as finish her daily chores or spend quality time with spouse, weâve got the right product for you. Eye My Baby is simple, easy to use and intelligent.Now you can stay relaxed and do your work or travel while your baby is sleeping alone in a room. Just place your Android phone near your baby (recommended: at least 1-2 meters away from your baby to minimize radiation effects of phone), start Eye My Baby and relax while the app monitors your baby. If your babyâs sleep is disturbed, the app tries to put your baby back to sleep by playing your pre-recorded audio or your babyâs favourite lullaby and informs you about babyâs cry via Phone Call, Email or Notification. You can see the Events Log to know what happened while you were away from your baby. Itâs a baby sitter, baby care and baby monitor app â all in one.â RECORDPut your baby back to sleep.1) Parentâs Voice â Record your personal audio message that the app can play when your babyâs sleep is disturbed.2) Play Song â Import your babyâs favourite lullaby from your phone so as to soothe your baby.â INTELLIGENT ALERTSOur baby monitor app intelligently alerts you via:Phone Call â Landline, feature phone or smartphoneEmailNotification (For this you need to have Eye My Baby installed on two phones)â BABYâS NOISE LEVELSet the sensitivity level (babyâs noise level) so that the app can detect babyâs noise and place a Call, send Email, push Notification, play Parentâs Audio or play a Lullaby as selected by you.â EVENTS LOGTrack all the activities that happened while you were away from your baby. â AUTO-SILENT MODEWhen ON, the phone automatically goes to Silent mode when the monitoring is started (so that your babyâs sleep is not disturbed from incoming calls or SMSes) and comes back to the original profile when the monitoring is stopped.â LOW BATTERY REMINDERIf battery in the phone near your baby goes below 10%, you can get a Notification so that you can connect it to power source.â BACKGROUND MONITORINGThe app remains ON even if the phone is locked.Wondering why it is called Eye My Baby?â¢ Eye â The app keeps an eye to know when your baby sleeps or makes noise.â¢ My â Personalize your settings like audio, noise level, lullaby, etc.â¢ Baby â Care for your baby.PLEASE NOTE:1) The app is just a means to monitor your baby but CANNOT replace your personal supervision of your baby.2) To avoid radiation causing harm to baby, keep phone at a distance of at least 1-2 meters from baby and set the noise sensitivity level accordingly.3) Click on ? in the app for more information about a particular feature of app.4) The app is NOT yet tablet optimized but it may work well on tablets.5) It is recommended that you connect your Android phone/tablet to a charger while running Eye My Baby.We would love to hear your feedback or about any bugs on ashish.chowdhary@wishtreetech.com.

        "comment": "Let me give a complete feedback..!! First of all starting with the Cons..!! 1. There are no SMS notifications..!!  The app is full of Pros which is very useful for the parents. 1. There are three different levels of noise which is best as compared to other apps. 2. There are 5 different ways to eye on the baby & calm down which includes 3 alerts & 2 different ways to calm down. 3. There is a low battery alert which u won\\'t found in any such app. 4. Finally it goes on Auto silent mode.  For all parents..!!",
