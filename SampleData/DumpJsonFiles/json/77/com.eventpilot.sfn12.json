        "comment": "Glad it finally works for nexus tablet. But the calendar is not usable. The problem is that there usually way too many concurrent events to display when each hour is only allowed one line and all the events must fit in that single line.   An alternative is to display events by type, show all  the symposium for the day, followed by posters. And sort the posters by time or by poster board number. Allow deleting events and taking notes.   Color coding by theme is not useful. By event type will be better.",
