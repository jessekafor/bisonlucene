    "description": "Free first person perspective indie horror game. If you like Slender, you'll like it too.!!! To Dr Web (and other antivirus apps) users - this game doesn't contain any viruses! It's perfectly safe; some antivirus software wrongly recognizes advertisement as threat.Search an old, abandoned house and collect any valuables but be careful - there are rumors of a ghost haunting the building. Experience fear and deep horrifying atmosphere.They told you it would be easy. Just break-in, grab all the stuff and get back to the door. They didn't know that house was not empty. And those creepy eyes on the wall.. You know she's coming for you, don't you?App with ads.",

        "comment": "The ambience is perfect, probably the best I\\'ve seen on android. It just needs some jumpscares for e.g. A 3 in 10 chance of a door swinging open when your near it. Also a decrease in the light around you and a torch would be amazing as it would add massively to the jumpy nature of the game",
