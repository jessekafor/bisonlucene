    "description": "Be guided through the exhibition Francis Bacon: five decades by the director of the Art Gallery of NSW Michael Brand and curator Anthony Bond. Share the exhibition curator insights into the extraordinary paintings of one of the twentieth centuryâs greatest artists.The app features audio commentary for each section of the exhibition set out over five decades of the artist's loves and life. There is also audio on some highlights of the show and archival material from the Francis Bacon studio. This exhibition showcases over 50 paintings â many of them monumental in size. Baconâs mature work took figurative painting to a new level, distorting appearances to intensify the sensation of reality. His images emerged almost by chance from paint applied in ways never conceived of before.",

The menus write clear and well laid out. I could use my own noise cancelling earphones too which shut out the sound of the air conditioner. Well done!",
