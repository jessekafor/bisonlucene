    "description": "Starbatt Game is an interstellar war exposition that presents the player as a defender of bomb probe attacks which approach Earth from all directions. These probes can be of four types, they appear in waves of eight and approach to explode and destroy the playerâs spaceship, which is in the center of the game. For the defense mission the player has a photonic cannon with three types of photons (red, green and blue) to destroy the enemy probes. The player will increase its rank, from soldier to general of the defense, as the player destroys its enemies, accumulating points, ammunition and spaceships. As a last resort, when in a desperate situation, the player will have access to warp jumps which will allow him to flee the location and appear in another combat zone of the universe. Starbatt is the first Standing Up style game created by EsteveAnimaciÃ³ for Tons of Toons Apps. These are games which require you to play standing up, with 360 degrees of game freedom (spherical background). Starbatt Game will also be available as a 180 degrees version which can be played sitting or lying. Starbatt starts a new age in App Games. It requires the player to be in an acceptable physical form to be able to play the game in 360 degrees. This application uses in-app purchases. You have 10 free games to enjoy Starbatt Game. After that, you will prompted to purchase the Full Version for unlimited access. - A new concept, the STANDING UP GAME. - A non-stop game with 15 increasing difficulty levels. - Incredible visual and musical staging. - High quality image and sound effects. - Great gameplay.",

        "comment": "This is the coolest game I have ever played in my life. Its just like sitting in the cockpit of your own spaceship. Looking down the gun ports, with your finger on the trigger ready to tear the hell out of any enemy spaceship that comes in range. You\\'re range of fire is 360 degrees around you; up, down, left and right. The game utilizes the gyroscope in your phone/tablet. That means you have to move your phone/tablet to the right to the left look up and look down to find your enemy through the windshield of",
