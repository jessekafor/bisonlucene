        "comment": "This developer has poor support. Had multiple problems with this app both on the Android and iPhone side. Scans would work, when the app wasn\\'t crashing and Force Closing. Scan ID\\'s were only useful for scanning tickets. Manual check-ins never worked for any of my events. The only way I could get it fully functional was to give out my Eventbee ID and password to an iPhone user. Thanks a lot Eventbee. Great concept, but horrible support. IF you decide to use them, make sure you start with a test event",

        "comment": "TERRIBLE TERRIBLE app. Eventbee sucks. MANY better options like TicketLeap, Eventbrite, Vendini, Brown Paper Tix, AttendStar, etc. Eventbee will nickel and dime you. They claim free for free events & tickets but this is not true. $1 flat fee is for very basic and limited features and they raise the price to unlock features every event manager would need to utilize. Again, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. STAY AWAY FROM EVENTBEE!",
