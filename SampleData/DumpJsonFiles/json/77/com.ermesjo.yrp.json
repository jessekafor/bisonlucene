But there needs to be an option to put in a URL from ANY weather service you\\'d like. That and fix the Y on Wednesday! Lol. The words too long and makes the Y go underneath the rest of the word when using day labels instead of dates. It does this in both font settings. Also... needs more fonts. for the money spent I\\'d expect these options to have been already added.",

        "comment": "The forecast temps are way off, up to 10 degrees F. Forecasts come from \\\"yr.no\\\" in Norway. How can a weather forecaster in Norway get accurate U.S. weather data without a U.S partner in place to supply the data?  In addition, I wonder if at least part of the problem is differing weather app expectations between U.S. users and Norwegians (where I presume the dev is located). U.S. users expect weather apps to show the current temp and forecast high temp(s) for future day(s). This app does not show current temps. It shows only forecast temps, depending on the particular widget selected, for one or three dayparts (a few hours into the future on the same day) or one or three future days. I suspect that the future-day forecasts may not be intended to be for the days\\' high temps (if they are, they are way off), but something else, like a daytime average temperature. (I\\'m just trying to come up with something to explain why the forecast day temps are always low.)   One star for the very inaccurate forecast temps. A second star for being the most beautiful weather widget, although unfortunately not a usable one.",
