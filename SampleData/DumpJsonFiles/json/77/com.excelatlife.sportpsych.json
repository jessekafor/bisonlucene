Most elite athletes use these mental skills whether they were formally taught or learned them through experience. However, amateur athletes can improve their performance by including these skills in their practice.For many athletes who are used to being physically focused, the mental skills can be a challenge. However, the time spent developing these skills and using them can be well worth the performance improvement of the physical skills.Often the only things that separate the good athletes from the elite athletes is the degree of motivation, the ability to focus and concentrate under all conditions, the ability to get \"in the zone\" when needed, and self-efficacy (the confidence in your ability).",
