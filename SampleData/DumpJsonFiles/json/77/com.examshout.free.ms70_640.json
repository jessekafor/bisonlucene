        "comment": "This app works fine on the HTC EVO with cyanogenmod installed.    I tend to overprepare for certification exams and I\\'m currently using the MS Press book and the examcram book for studying/practice questions and the questions on this app do not seem to have the same level difficulty.  Also, I\\'ve noticed a number of grammar issues and things that just seem wrong.  Example of grammar issue: \\\"you need to explain the concept of lower-level AD objects when they become heir to Group policy settings to a group of new IT trainees.  What is that called?\\\"  Example of answer that seems wrong: \\\"you have a network with over 1000 computer nodes configured.  You have a very important software program that must eventually be installed on all user computers.  However, to make sure the service is running properly, you have been instructed to create a test deployment of 10 different machines.  How can you properly configure an update to target on these 10 machines\\\"  The answer they list as correct is \\\"create an organizational unit for the 10 specified machines\\\". Creating an OU will not will not \\\"properly configure an update to target these 10 machines\\\", which I believe is wrong or needs rewording.",
