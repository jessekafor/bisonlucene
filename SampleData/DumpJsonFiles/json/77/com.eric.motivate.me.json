    "description": "***Read This for Important Information!***Motivation, motivation, motivation! That's what 'Motivate Me' is all about.I originally created this app out of necessity for myself. I've always been subject to laziness and impulse eating so one day I decided to write a little app that I could open and use when I feel like skipping my workout or eating something I really, really shouldn't.And I hope it can help you like it has helped me.What this app can't do... - This app isn't magic, it can't create desire inside you to get in shape or lose weight. It can't kick you in the butt and make you go to the gym. It can't throw away your junk food or make you dislike the flavor of fat and sugar. - This app won't amaze you with fancy graphics or animations, it's simple with minimal fluff, simple and straight to the point.What this app can do... - It can help you get past the impulse to eat a doughnut at work or to make a quick stop at McDonald's for a burger. - It can give you that little extra push you need to hit the weights or put on your running shoes.Again, it's not magic but it has certainly helped me burn some extra calories and keep from eating some extra calories.It's motivation, plain and simple.A quick tip on using this app:Let it help you, don't fight it, let it help you talk yourself into doing what you really want. Let it push you to be better.Future plans for this app:There are a lot of additions I would like to make but I'm not a professional programmer so I need to know if you want them. Here are a few planned additions: - A history that can be graphed of all the bad calories you haven't eaten from using this app. - A history of calories burned or workouts completed from the help of this app. - Many more motivational phrases and images (size permitting). - Workout ideas when your normal exercises just aren't motivating you. - Anything else I can think of that would be helpful!So please, if you find this app useful, rate it and add in the comments what you would like to see in future releases to help you stay on the path to fitness, health and happiness!Thank you very much and I hope you have a wonderful day!Best Regards,Eric Schmidt",

        "comment": "I really like this app and the simplicity of it. Especially the \\'yes\\' \\'no\\' questions on the motivational section - really makes you think about what you\\'re doing. For the future more motivational images would be nice, and maybe an option for male or female pictures (i have no idea if that\\'s possible.) Recording how this app has helped you would be good. Or maybe just a little congratulations/well done after you\\'ve resisted a temptation/done some exercise.",
