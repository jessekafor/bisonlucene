        "comment": "This might as well be a eBook, as it is all text and no action. I was looking for a screen game that would enable my family to keep track of car plates, travel bingo, scavenger hunts, etc. This does not do that. The app merely provides an extensive list of game ideas. Nice in that sense, but just not what I was looking for.",
