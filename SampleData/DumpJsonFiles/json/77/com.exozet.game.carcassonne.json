    "description": "Just a few years after its release, Carcassonne became a modern classic and a must-play. Turn by turn, the players create a landscape by placing tiles with roads, cities, fields, and cloisters. The players deploy their followers - knights, monks, thieves, or farmers - to earn points. The player with the most points after the final scoring wins the game. The ever-changing landscape makes each game a new experience. With the official expansion \"The River II\" and 12 challenges, it never gets old. You can play against clever AI opponents or with up to 4 other players in a local multiplayer match. Features:- Mobile version of the award-winning tile-based board game \"Carcassonne\"- Includes the official expansion \"The River II\"- Features 12 challenges- Clever AI opponents with individual strategies- Local multiplayer mode for up to 5 players- Tutorial and manual for beginners- Language Support: English, German, French, SpanishPress:PocketGamer.co.uk - MOBILE GAME OF THE YEAR 2012PocketGamer: Readers' Choice Awards - MOBILE GAME OF THE YEAR 2012AndroidMag.de: MULTIPLAYER GAME OF THE YEAR 2012PocketGamer.co.uk - Silver Award: \"A great adaptation of a great board game\" PlayAndroid.com - 24/30: \"This really is one of those must-haves that youâll keep returning to, time and time and again.\" - \"I had never played the game before, but now Iâm hooked.\"MeAndMyDroid.com - 4.5/5: \"Graphically Carcassonne is excellent for a board game and its thematic audio certainly adds atmosphere.\" - \"4.5/5 stars for a well-crafted board game\"Gamezebo.com - 4/5: \"Carcassonne for Android is a great adaptation of the popular board game\"DroidGamers.com: \"If you looking for a enjoyable, easy to play, well built, inexpensive strategy game, I recommend you download Carcassonne for Android in the Market.\"BestAppEver Awards: \"Best Android Board Games - Second Place\" -------Follow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/exozet_games",

It will show a + next to a number of points, take up my person, then not award those points. Sometimes it doesn\\'t finish taking up all of my people before giving the total. It always finishes the total of the AI players. It\\'s extremely frustrating. I also would like the ability to play against live players.",
