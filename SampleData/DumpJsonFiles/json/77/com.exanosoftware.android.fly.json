        "comment": "I\\'ve played about 2 hours of this game and it\\'s pretty fun. I have a few suggestions though.   1. Add gas to the map. I very rarely lose to anything other than running out of gas. I understand the importance of buying upgrades but I don\\'t like that it\\'s impossible to get further unless you upgrade  2. Decrease the hit box for birds. I can\\'t count the number of times I\\'ve clearly missed the bird but it still counts as a hit.   Bugs:  1. When I lock my phone mid game and the unlock the app crashes.",

        "comment": "This takes a slight twist on the classic \\\"Upgrade\\\" genre, giving the player more control up front.  The mechanics need some tweaking, and the interface could use a bit more attention, but the core of the game is all kinds of fun!",
