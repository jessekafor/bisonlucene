    "description": "You've booked a trip to your favorite getaway but the plane is full and you're stuck in the middle seat, sound familiar? Let Seat AlertsÂ® by ExpertFlyer help find you a better seat in 3 easy steps:1. Look up the Seat Map of your flight.2. Set up a Seat Alert to find window seats, aisle seats and more.3. Get notified if your preferred seat is found.Seat Alerts will monitor the available seats right up until the flight departs. If it becomes available you can change your seat when your Seat Alert notification arrives, just contact the airline or the travel agency that booked your ticket. Seat Alerts finds a window or aisle seat better than 75% of the time.â¢ With a Free account, you can set up one Seat Alert at a time using the Any Seat, Any Window or Any Aisle options.â¢ Seat maps include SeatGuruÂ® seat ratings so you know which seat is the right seat for you. Just click on a seat to see its rating and review.â¢ If you need multiple Seat Alerts at the same time, additional alerts and alert options are available for purchase.â¢ Supports over 140 airlines that have preassigned seating.Note: Physical seat availability has nothing to do with Award, Upgrade, or fare ticket inventory. Please read our FAQ for more information: http://www.expertflyer.com/expertflyer-support-faqâ¢ If you have questions about using the app, please email us first or see the in-app FAQ page.Also works with ExpertFlyer.com Basic and Premium subscriptions.",

I want an aisle seat in United Economy Plus on an international flight The app says there are aisle seats available, but they are on regular economy. This is the case even when I click the Premium Only checkbox in options. Note I do have premium status on United. Also no place to save American Airlines FF numbers. Also the seat availability data didn\\'t seem to match what I found on UAs web site. Also I found the workflows to be not quite intuitive...had to search for how to specify premium only seats, for example. Finally, seems to force restart the app most times when I launch it, and I once got a very peculiar error related to a null pointer reference or some such.",
