        "comment": "Well, I liked the interface about looking at the pictures of various items, tap to add quantities, that is pleasing. But, this program lacks some UI logic flow. Most important thing I should mention that, I can add my custom product and delete the custom product. But I cannot delete any built in products that came with the program. For example, I never buy dog food as I dont have dog. It would be nice if I could delete that product from the database so that it will be quicker for me to pick the items that I buy often.  The button \\\"Finish Shopping Later\\\" is confusing. It should give option directly to , \\\"Save The list\\\", \\\"Delete List\\\", \\\"Mark as Completed\\\", \\\"Reset List as UnComplete\\\". Although I can do all of these tasks by tweaking the options. I would say, this interface should be changed.   By the way, if custom product deletion feature is added in the future, I would say, there should be another option to reset database too. That will make the logic balanced.  A feature request : What about letting the user add own icon for the custom product. That will be super comfortable to build the list quickly.  Other than these 2 points, I would have given 5 Stars.",
