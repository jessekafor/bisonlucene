        "comment": "I recently became totally deaf because of a tumor and I need to learn ASL. I purchased this app, and it has never worked for me. Site Doesn\\'t Exist. I thought it was my phone, tried it on several different phone models, tablets, different versions of Android, same results on all. I emailed the developer several times, no response. If it really does work, some reviews says that it does, what is the secret? Too late for an refund. I am hoping for an update that would fix my problems.  I visited the developers website, looks impressive and read the bio of the instructors. Gilda Toby Ganezer looks like an impressive person. Her quotes \\\"Give love and you will get something in return.\\\"  \\\"I am against all forms of inhumane suffering.\\\" has meaning.  Hopefully you can help me with my problem. I really need to start some place to learn ASL.  I am now using an Samsung Galaxy S3, if that helps. I use my phone only for text, email, Captel, Internet and IP Relay. Of course normal phone use is out of the question for me.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. I don\\'t expect an reply, but for some small spark of hope, maybe something will come out of this.",
