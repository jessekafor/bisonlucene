        "comment": "It\\'s REALLY SLOW & GPS is way off. No list of wineries, just varietals. Can\\'t find 2 varietals at once. Can\\'t find ones close to each other. No photos & some have hardly any description. Hot News way out of date. Lots of advertising. Offers say show screen to merchant. Wow, how does that work when booking a hotel? The text is really hard to read, no paragraph breaks. I gave 2 stars but it really does not seem very useful. Even for free, I expect an app like this to be useful. As I said, disappointing.",

        "comment": "This application had everything I needed for a fun trip to wine country. The GPS navigation was helpful for finding which winery or restaurant to go to next. I found some good 2 for 1 tasting offers and deals. The events calender listed the concerts that were playing around the different towns. The connectivity (data speeds) in the Valley are pretty bad, but that isn\\'t the app maker\\'s fault. Verizon needs to build more cell towers in the area. Overall, 5 stars, thanks for making this free for visitors!",
