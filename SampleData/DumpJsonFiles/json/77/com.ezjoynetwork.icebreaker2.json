        "title": "Great idea, but needs a few fixes",
        "comment": "I love the game, but it is very hard to play due to the size of the explosions when it hits, making it very hard to see the ball until it it\\'s almost past the paddle, the screen following the ball and shifting just before the bottom, and worst of all, the frequent freezes (right after hits) giving me almost no time to react since the ball jumps ahead in a direction I can not anticipate while I can not move the paddle at all. If fixed, the game would be my favorite. As is, it\\'s pretty frustrating to play.",

        "comment": "Fun concept just gets extremely frustrating when the ball gets stuck bouncing between the walls and basically takes the entire time to come down. The tiny shards left over are impossible to hit its really luck with little control over the ball. Id suggest making it like other ice breaker games reach a certain percent or make it so those tiny pieces arent left behind! Thanks.",

        "comment": "I got this as I thought it was the same as Ceramic Destroyer or Amazing Breaker, both of which I love but this games far from enjoyable. The most annoying thing is even if u hit the ball straight it keeps going side to side taking ages to come back down near the paddle. Plus the paddle is so small u can barely see it at times. Lastly, u will find u are always left with tiny bits of ice to hit which takes up so much time that u could lose ur game and have to start all over. Just not enjoyable so un-install",
