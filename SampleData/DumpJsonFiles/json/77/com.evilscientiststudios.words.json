    "description": "âWords donât come easyâ is a tile based word puzzle game. You start on a 63-field play board with 62 lettered tiles. You have to form at least 3-letter words horizontally, vertically or both since words can also intersect by sharing a common tile.Valid words are coloured in green and can be cleared by double-tapping on them.Tiles are moved with swipe gestures. You can also drag a tile by performing a long-press on it.The primary goal is to clear all tiles. If you've accomplished that try to do it again with the least amount of double-taps.The game with the least amount of cleared words is considered the best!Enjoy ...",
