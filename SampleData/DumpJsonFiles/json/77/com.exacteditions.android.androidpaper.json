We also have a tonne of sample issues ready to read on Exactly right now.Exactly brings magazines and books to Android in their original full-colour format.

Access free content from over 100 titles, or use your Exact Editions subscription to read the latest issues on the day they're published.â Sync issues by tapping the sync button next to the issue name.â Swipe pages left and right, or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page.â Pinch or double tap pages to zoom.â Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps.â Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article.Here's a list of the permissions we request and why we request them:'View network status' -> We only sync over wi-fi as the files are quite large and we don't want you getting charged for phone data.'Full Internet access' -> We need to access the internet to download issues!'Directly call phone numbers' -> When you tap a phone number in a magazine, the app will ask if you want to go ahead a call it.'Modify/delete SD card contents' ->  Your synced issues are saved on your SD card.Hopefully that's useful!",

        "comment": "An ugly interface for browsing the publications, it completely ignores modern Android UI guidelines.  Zooming and scrolling within a publication is jerky and slow. Swiping to the next page works, but provides no visual feedback of the page transition - it\\'s a small complaint, but a slide or page-turn animation would help the user feel some continuity.  Lastly, and probably worst of all, text is stored as a relatively low-resolution bitmap. Zoom in and everything is an ugly blur - zoom out and some words are clear while others are blurry as poor-quality image-scaling takes its toll.",
