        "comment": "BUT here are some suggestions to make the game even better! I feel like you should be able to buy upgrades with the gems. For example. Upgrades for power ups that randomly appear, and with each upgrade the power up lasts longer. Power ups could be a magnet (close range), speed increased, and a shield.  Or just to buy different backgrounds! P.S. sorry if this has already been suggested P.S.S. for some reason my phone says this game is malware? Or just dangerous. .. could this be fixed?  Thank you!",
