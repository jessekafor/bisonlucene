    "description": "Inspired by the Bronx Zoo Cobra and her infamous jail break, Bronx Cobra is a unique espionage action puzzle game!You take the role of a sneaky, sibilant hero. Use careful timing and problem solving skills to avoid security cameras and evade capture!You literally draw your path to the screen, and the cobra follows!(Protip: coiling up by drawing a circle or scribbling at the end of your line can help you hide.)The game borrows its visual style from the classic \"snake\" game. Controls are similar to the hit \"air traffic control\" games. (But we promise, no Snakes on a Plane jokes!) As for Gameplay, the tactical espionage of the Metal Gear series is a strong influence, but there's really nothing else like it on the market!Seriously, check it out![PRE-ORDER DETAILS]This is a pre-order application!The full game is still in production, but we wanted to give you guys a sneak peak! This version includes five playable levels. By pre-ordering this version, your game will be automatically upgraded to the full version upon release!",
