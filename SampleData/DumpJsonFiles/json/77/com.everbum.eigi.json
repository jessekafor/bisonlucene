Every one had 10 subjects and 2 hour tests. But the results varied for most of the foods from 20 to 100. Utterly useless.\"Hmm, this review makes me sad. We worked a lot for this database. First, we added references for all our results, so it's easy to check directly the sources of information. Then, our data can be double-checked with The University of Sydney (http://www.glycemicindex.com/) database.- Jo - September 25, 2012 - HTC Evo 4G with version 1.02\"The content is useful, but every time I enter the app I have to update the database or there are no entries and no info. Why not just leave it and update only when new things are added?\"If there is no error during the update, the app will not allow you to make another update until new data is available.- stasik - September 18, 2012 - Samsung Galaxy S3 with version 1.02\"This program has a good DB, probably from several sources. [...] putting the search button at the top bar would be really great.\"We added such a button in version 1.10.- Quinn - July 14, 2012 - HTC myTouch 4G Slide with version 1.01\"This app collects GI data from many sources, so you get to see how foods were rated by different studies. (It will often vary a bit, due to the methods used.) Nice to be able to see multiple results, but I wish the entries listed what was used as the control in each study, so we can tell which numbers are comparable.[...]\"From version 1.10 on, you can see the source of information and also details about the testing process: subjects and duration used.",

Be it the null hypothesis that you are stating. Which might be confusing to the non researcher. 2. Your research is widely accepted worldwide. It has been replicated numerous times. Thus as you all well know, replication has different requirements. Your study must mimic the other studies . However, your way of testing can very slightly as long as the integrity is intact.",
