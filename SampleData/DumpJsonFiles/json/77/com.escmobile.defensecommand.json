I bought the full version after finishing the first campaign so yes there is a lot to this game. BUT, please expand the maps to more than a single screen view. I know you\\'re doing the best you can with the touchscreen limitation but come on, in the next campaign I better see maps that require exploring. Oh, and shadow the unexplored parts. PLUS, give us an option to \\\"re-buy\\\" last  item purchased. I hate always going back to the bottom menu just to place another mine.  Other than that, GREAT JOB and keep em coming!!",

Other than that I like it so far.",

Skirmish would keep me opening this and giving financial support if the cheating AI didn\\'t start with half a map of units and defenses. Just give them a moderate base and the ability to expand, and this game will be near perfect.",

Worth the download for free, skip the paid version until they add more content.",
