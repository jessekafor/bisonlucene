        "comment": "I have used this yoga workout for over 2 years.  It is great.  I dont always do it in the AM but it is still effective anytime of day.  5 workouts between 20-25 min. each.  start with the forward bends it is easiest, then standing.  back bends and hip openers are more challenging but worth the effort.  so glad i can have this on my tablet now. Thank you Rodney Yee!",
