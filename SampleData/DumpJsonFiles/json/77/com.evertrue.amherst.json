        "comment": "In terms of being connected to other Amherst alumni,  I think this is the best piece of technology that has been presented thus far.  I like how it shows other local alums through tags,  and it\\'s also nice that it integrates in with the three major social networking sites,  at least the three main ones I use... I only wish it had SMS notifications so that I don\\'t feel like I have to constantly log in.  Also it would be nice if there was a feature for fostering conversation with local but unfamiliar alumni.",
