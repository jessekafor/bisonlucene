And drag for the rest! This combination of fewer, larger keys, and the special letter arrangement results in a typing activity which is mostly around the center of the keyboard with short and simple taps or drags! MessagEase's patented design is the result of many years of scientific research in the field of Computer-Human Interface (CHI). In addition to Android phones, MessagEase runs on the iPhone, Palm OS, Tablet PC (Windows), and Pocket PC.
