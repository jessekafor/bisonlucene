    "description": "A great shoot game to shoot missile from two tanks. Just target the bombs dropped from fighter bombers. Keep shooting and bring them down at the air. The bombs come from different directions, so shoot them by touching different angles, area and directions. The touch point is a target of missiles. If missiles have not hit bombs, it would explode.",
