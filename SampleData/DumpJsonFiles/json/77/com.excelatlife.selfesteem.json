At least the test didn\\'t infuriate me with inaccurate data-recording like the Worry Box did, but it was VERY difficult to read the relevant data since it took up maybe a quarter of the screen.  Uninstalled immediately after taking test.  Who on earth would download such a horrible thing just to read about these topics?  I\\'ll stick with my web browser or Instapaper for offline emergencies.",
