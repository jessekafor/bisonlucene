Many MLP fans would have been satisfied just with having the ability to play voice clips from their favourite characters. However, that wasn\\'t enough for developer Eric. A recent update added widget capability to the app so now you can play voice clips of your favourite ponies (and non-ponies) right from your home screen by tapping on the characters\\' faces! Eric is also to be commended for his prompt responses to any issues and bugs that are brought to his attention. I hereby give this app 5 out of 5 stars!",
