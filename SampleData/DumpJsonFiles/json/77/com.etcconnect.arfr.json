    "description": "The aRFR from Electronic Theatre Controls, Inc. provides a riggers remote for any Eos or Congo Family product.  This application can be used with both operating systems and requires Eos family software 1.9.6 or higher and Congo family software 6.1 or higher installed on the connected lighting system. The aRFR supports all of the features on the Net3 RFR product, adding more functionality through the use of the touchscreen.  The exact features of the aRFR are sourced by the connected control system; not all features are supported for both platforms.  Check the documentation for your console. Download the free tryout version of this application and verify that it runs on your specific Android device. In tryout mode, the software will disconnect every 10 minutes, and after 5 days, the option to connect will be disabled. You will then have to buy the full version. To be able to buy the update, you need to run Android 2.2 or later due to current limitations in the Google purchasing service.With the aRFR on Eos Family products, you can:â¢    Select channels and set parameter dataâ¢    Playback and edit cuesâ¢    Park channelsâ¢    Conduct dimmer and channel checksâ¢    Patch conventional fixturesâ¢    Manipulate Color, Pan/Tilt and other parameters using dedicated graphical controllersâ¢    View a Cue List Display (monitor only), with current cue, several previous and pending cues displayedâ¢    View and interact with a Playback display; controls include Go, Stop/Back and Go to CueWith the aRFR on Congo Family products, you can:â¢    Select channels and set parameter dataâ¢    Playback and edit presetsâ¢    Conduct dimmer and channel checksâ¢    Patch conventional fixturesâ¢    Manipulate Color, Pan/Tilt and other parameters using dedicated graphical controllersâ¢    Calibrate Scroller Rolls",

No way am I going to pay $50 for an app if I can\\'t try it first.  This is a complete waste of space... don\\'t bother downloading it unless you\\'re planning on buying it immediately.
