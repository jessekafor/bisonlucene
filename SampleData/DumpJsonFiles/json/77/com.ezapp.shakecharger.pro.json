    "description": "Simply open the app, and hand the phone to your friend.  Watch as he shakes the phone furiously for a couple of minutes.  When the phone battery hits 100% a notification window that says 'Charge Complete' appears.  Immediately after that another notification window appears telling him that he was pranked!NOTE: This is NOT real! There is NO practical use for this app other than playing a joke on your friends.  If you really think you can charge your phone's battery by shaking it then you should probably buy another phone!",
