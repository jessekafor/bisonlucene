        "comment": "I use Eurochannel on my TV with Logitech Revue.  Works great!  Easy to navigate; excellent broad-ranging content for my interests. I also have other foreign channels but Eurochannel has english subtitles.  Allows commercial free viewing and allows one to broaden interests to other parts of the world rather than some of the trash shown on US television interrupted with commercials every 3 or 4 minutes. I THOROUGHLY ENJOY EUROCHANNEL.  Excellent content considering the small monthly charge.  I also have had good experience with Google+, hangouts, etc., on both the Logitech Revue on both TV and mobile devices.  On EuroChannel I view mostly EuroCine (movies), EuroMagazine (history and documentaries).  Not so much TV shows or series.  As stated, I am very pleased and have no complaints.",
