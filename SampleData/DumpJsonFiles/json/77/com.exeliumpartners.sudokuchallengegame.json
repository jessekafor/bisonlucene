        "comment": "I love this app. In response to the below comment, I love the pause feature... not so I can think on the puzzle but because I have a crazy life and am frequently interrupted in my day and per Murphy\\'s Law it usually happens when I\\'m playing. That said I probably only use it @ 25% of the time.",
