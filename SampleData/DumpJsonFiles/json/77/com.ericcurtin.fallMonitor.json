    "description": "Fall Monitor is an application that is used to safeguard a person who has bad balance. It sends a message via SMS to the designated emergency contact(s) upon falling. It may also be used for activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, horse riding, etc. Other uses may include people who suffer from epilepsy, narcolepsy, etc.The SMS contains a link to where the person has fallen on google maps. There are three ways a location can be determined via GPS, cell-tower triangluation or using Wi-Fi networks. It will use the most accurate technique available to locate where the person has fallen.Fall Monitor uses a clever algorithm in order to detect a fall. It must be noted there is a delay of ten seconds before the alert goes off. This is the still state. The alert only activates if the user has not moved for ten seconds after the fall. This is used to prevent false alarms, as the user may get up again after the fall.The alert then gives the user forty seconds to cancel the alert in case of a false alarm. Key Features competitors don't have:â Automatic calibration.â Three different location techniques in order to detect the fall location.â Works while the screen is off.â Simple interface.â Accesses phonebook for contacts.â Works while the phone is locked.â Fall monitor service starts automatically when you turn on the phone.â Multiple emergency contacts supported.â Regular updates.â Direct rapid feedback from developer (me!) for any problems that may be encountered.Since I am a solo developer, I vacate all the roles in the development process. Please feel free to give me feedback on the app and in particular how it could be improved upon. Bug reports would be greatly appreciated also, if any bugs exist. You can contact me via email (ericcurtin1990 [at] gmail.com), and I will try my best to respond within twenty-four hours. All emails will be responded to.Websites:http://ie.linkedin.com/in/ericcurtin1990/http://ericcurtin.wordpress.com/",

        "title": "This is the best one i\\'ve tried",
        "comment": "I\\'ve tried several fall detection apps and this is the one worked for me best so far. I especially wanna highlight the easy-to-use \\\"calibrate\\\" feature. It can \\\"learn\\\" how you might fall. You don\\'t have to figure out low high triggers or sensor values like in other apps. The UI might be a little rough. But it\\'s the function that matters for me!",

        "comment": "It may not be pretty, but it does the job! I feel so much safer since I installed this app. I love that you can change the person that is alerted when you fall in case I\\'m visiting family, and that you can turn it off if you need to so that my poor mother doesn\\'t get woken up in the middle of the night because I knocked my phone off the table in my sleep. The calibration could use a bit more instruction, though. I wasn\\'t sure when it was ok to stand up again. When are you making more apps!?",
