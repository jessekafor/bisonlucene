    "description": "LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF & IMPROVE YOUR LIFEThis app is based upon research in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and is sponsored by a clinical psychologist. It is meant for personal assessment to aid in self-help for personal improvement. By examining your thinking styles, you can learn to change them which can reduce anxiety, depression, and unreasonable anger. In addition, you can improve your self-esteem and your relationships.CONTAINS:***Articles\tThe app includes articles written by a cognitive-behavioral clinical psychologist to help you understand the process of cognitive therapy and how to use the methods.***Cognitive Styles Test\tThis is a 110 item test examining 13 styles of thinking that can lead to problems in relationships, problems at work or in school, and problems coping with life stressors.These styles include:\t***Anxious Style\t***Self-Esteem Style\t***Perfectionistic Style\t***Approval-Seeking Style\t***Demand Style\t***Withholding Style\t***Control Style\t***Dependency Style\t***Externalizing Style\t***Emotional Style\t***Passivity Style\t***Trust Style\t***Blaming StyleThis psychological test can tell you the thinking styles that cause you to act and feel the way you do. By learning what types of cognitive styles you have, you can determine what types of irrational thinking you are likely to engage in. Certain irrational thinking will create additional life problems or make it difficult to solve the problems you are confronted with.COGNITIVE DIARYThis app is meant to be used with the Cognitive Diary app in which you record events that occur and determine if you engaged in any irrational thinking. If you did, it helps you to develop some statements to challenge the thinking. Once you have developed the cognitive challenges you can review them daily to help you remember to challenge the irrational thinking.By challenging your irrational thinking you can address problems more effectively. Change your mood and behavior by changing your thinking.Please email problems or suggestions. We are listening and want to provide a quality app.",

        "comment": "this is a great tool to help retrain your brain.  CBT therapists are hard to come by. Living in a rural community, I must drive at least 2 hours to see any therapist, much less a therapist with CBT training & experience.  For me, this app is a godsend. For me, this app is better than having a personal therapist on call 24/7. My .02 worth. YMMV.",

Not a substitute for a good therapist by any stretch of the imagination but well thought out information that presents the techniques of CBT clearly and helpfully: if you want to change the way you think, this will help.",
