        "comment": "fun and wasy way to learn. thanks. only thing im missing is a quiz on the accompanied text. many words there are important to remember and understand. and a quiz would make it easier to memorize. also the app is unstable, when reading a chapter it will go out of the chapter at random. so i have to go in and  scroll down where i left off. anyhow, would love more math and chemistry apps like this, I would pay for it too. you get to practice what you learned!!!",

        "comment": "Program is very good, could use a bit more details or methods. Also what i found wrong is often it will tell you have the wrong answer when you dont. Example: answer is : \\\"x = -2\\\" , it will tell you are wrong and claim answer is \\\"x = -2/1\\\" now obiously that is incorrect i believe as both have the same value and there\\'s no point in putting 1 as a denominator. Hopefully they can fix those type of glitches in the future. Thanks!",
