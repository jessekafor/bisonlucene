        "comment": "The application does pretty much what it says it\\'s going to do. It however seems to have problem with certain phone models. It would be wise to call Escort Customer Service before you plunk down the cash for the Live Cord. Having said that, it is a pretty useful tool. Like most every product that uses your GPS and Bluetooth, it is hungry for battery power. It does help convert your Radar Detector into a semi-police detector with the help of fellow motorists. It\\'s worth it.",
