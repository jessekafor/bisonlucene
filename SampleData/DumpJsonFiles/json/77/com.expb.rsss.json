On face value the game had what it took to make me buy it and play it for an hour, just not any of what it takes to keep me playing it. Not only did I not accomplish anything, when my son came over to play it and started getting confused I took it from his hands to mitigate the loss of intelligence.",

        "comment": "I don\\'t know why this isn\\'t the most popular game in the Android Market.  Premise: you do sports.  Problem: you have no idea how to actually control your guy. Furthermore, actually knowing *how* to control him is very different than *successfully* controlling him.  In most cases you have a weird rubber band mechanic (imagine something like the opposite of the Angry Birds slingshot) that you use to drag guys and objects around to complete objectives. Sounds easy right? Well, it\\'s not. It\\'s all complicated by the fact that your guy and the objects around him have some sublimely bizarre and exceptionally Realistic physics that cause... well, they cause weird stuff to happen.  This game is a joke - kind of. But this game is also a game. A lot of what makes it fun is that it doesn\\'t give you any idea how to play the thing at all, and as you experiment with the various physics models completely insane things happen.  Pay your two bucks and play this thing. Just do it.",

Your only chance to win the gold is if someone drags your body to the finish line with a stretchy nylon rope.  It\\'s morbid, but that\\'s the reality in Realistic Summer Sports Challenge.  Every event has you attach a cable to something- a weight, a horse, or even the athlete himself- and tug it along to complete the challenge.  It will take practice, and you will get frustrated, but ultimately, you will be amused.",
