You need a higher level of knowledge to get the most out of this app. This is the Wireshark of apps. I would like to use this to extract images and text from my networks traffic and don\\'t know where to start. If you could please, provide a more detailed manual on how to use the Tools and commands available to make this work for me. Maybe provide some apps that work along with this to accomplish some of the common tasks. Keep up the good work!",

        "comment": "I remember when Shark was the only packet sniffing option on android and frankly, it left a lot to be desired. Enter Wi.cap. This thing has just about every feature of Wireshark and then some. I am still learning the interface (help manual? where is it?) but I can tell already that this will satisfy every possible need you will have for sniffing on android. Yes it costs a lot, but you get what you pay for here. The premier packet sniffer on android and if you are into that sort of ting, you should buy it.",
