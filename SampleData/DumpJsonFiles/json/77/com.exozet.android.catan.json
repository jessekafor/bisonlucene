    "description": "Catan 3.0: âCities and Knightsâ expansion (IAP) now available, numerous optimizations to base game!\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.True to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources. If there are no other players available, various Catanians, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his... The popular Catan expansions âSeafarersâ and âCities and Knightsâ are available as In-App purchases.The complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy! The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan â but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catanâs new wealth! Youâll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps. Features: - Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese- Optimized for standard and high resolution smartphones - Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set - Hot seat multiplayer mode - Smart computer opponents with individual strategies - Scrollable game board including zoom option - Freely combinable game settings - Game statistics - Comprehensive tutorial - Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants - Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario âThe first Islandâ- 3 different graphic sets to choose from ***** Suggestions for improvements and feature requests? Mail to android@usm.de We are looking forward to your feedback! When contacting our support team, please provide details on the type of device and Android OS version used as well as a detailed description of the issue. Thank you!For news and updates follow us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and www.twitter.com/USM_News*****Catan FAQ:Question: Why do I have to download additional files after purchasing?Answer: The download from Google play includes the basic game data and a tool that will determine your deviceâs display resolution and then download the optimal graphics data for your device. Question: which Android security permissions does Catan need and why?Answer: âStorageâ to write data to the SD or move the game data, âNetwork communicationâ to download game data and access the In App Store and âsystem toolsâ to check if Catan is already running to resume a game.Question: I bought one of the expansions but after an update, reinstallation of Catan or after restoring my phone the expansion seems gone?Answer: Donât worry; your initial purchase is already saved in your Google account. However for technical reasons you have to select âBuyâ again. Confirm and a message will tell you that youâve already purchased it. You will NOT be billed twice!Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating from or when restoring my phone. Is there any way to restore it?Answer: Savegames from old versions can usually be restored automatically. For all other cases weâve integrated a cheat code: Enter campaign mode and go to select player. Enter âCatanWarp*â (* = 1â15, e.g \"CatanWarp5\") as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button. Enter your phoneâs settings menu. Select applications/manage applications/Catan/ and then âForce Stopâ. Restart Catan. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number by selecting âNew scenario *â.*****",

I found the game to be buggy and freeze/crash when using an old Droid X, but since upgrading to a Nexus 4 I\\'ve found the game to run smoothly with no bugs or crashes.  Perhaps it doesn\\'t run the best on older devices.",

Its a very strategic game and i strongly suggest going through the tutorials before you jump in.  I really hope the game supports online multiplayer at some point as i have several friends and coworkers who would love to play across multiple devices with eachother.",

C&K board can be overcrowded and the game won\\'t let you select what you need to and then you are stuck. Fix the bugs and I\\'d give it a higher rating.",
