    "description": "Do you want to take a photo of your face or of you together with your friend, but there is no one around who can hold your mobile and do it for you? - Face Photo is a perfect app for such an occasion. Face Photo app recognizes when faces get within your camera range, automatically adjusts settings and then  takes a photo for you. The only thing you need to do is to pick how many people will be in the picture and turn your mobile camera lens towards the face(s). You donât have to try many times to take a good photo of yourself any more. Not even mentioning the difficult scenario when you tried to take a photo of two faces e.g. you and your girlfriend or boyfriend. Try now to take these photos with Face Photo - it is a  really easy way to quickly get amazing commemorative photos. The application is very useful: - when you are on your own with your girlfriend/boyfriend and want to take a photo of both of you together- during solitary trips or walks- when you need to create a good photo of yourself for use on social media websites such as Facebook, Google+, etc. - and in many other situationsHow does it work? Detailed description in three steps: 1. Switch on the app and pick how many people you want in your photo - click an icon with one or two people (you can always change your mind and update it when the app is on).2. Holding your smartphone horizontally in your stretched hand, aim the camera lens towards you. /In this moment the app automatically recognizes faces (one or two depending on your choice), adjusts the photo settings and awaits till the faces get in the central position of the frame. If the faces are not in the middle or one of the faces is out of the frame, the app makes a delicate beeping sound and you need to aim the phone towards the faces. The higher the beeping sound frequency the closer you are to the ideal position. When you hear a longer and loud âbeepâ sound (it means the faces have been recognized and the lens is in the optimal position to take a photo) smile and hold the phone still for two/three seconds (itâs the time needed to adjust the focus settings and take a photo). Then you can have a look at your smartphone screen and view your photo :D/ 3. If you like the photo just press the âSAVEâ button to save it on your phoneâs memory SD card in the DCIM/FacePhoto folder, but if itâs not the perfect photo press the BACKâ button and try again. Reprot a bugAt the moment the Face Photo app is published in beta version and we are still working on its further development to serve the users even better.
