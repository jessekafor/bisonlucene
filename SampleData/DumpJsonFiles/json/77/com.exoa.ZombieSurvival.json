Please  make  the  aiming  Cross  bigger  because  you   have  a  job  seeing  it. Secondly  Please  slow  the  sombies  down  a  bit. Great  game  though   but  in  the  tunnel  its  hard  to  see  the  little  white  aiming  cross.            a  great  idea.   BUT  PLEA%",

Guns,zombies,action and hours of replayability..When I 1st started the game I was stunned with the amazing 3 Demensional graphics But that wasn\\'t all the Guns modeling was great...this game may be one of the best survival game I\\'ve played till date...It can compete with tittles such as Dead trigger and call of duty black ops zombies, My only complaint is that once playin for about 15 minutes You will encounter lag a fix to that would be gladly appreciated, the reason may be because of the Zombies..Besides that its an overall sensational game...I would gladly pay 5$ or more for this title....Things I might want to see in the near future- More maps,more guns,co-op play and online 1 team survivor other team Undead..Keep up the good work guys (:",
