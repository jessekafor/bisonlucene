Sandra brings 30+ years of dedicated study and practice to her passion. She is a natural intuitive, Fourth Degree Reiki Master, Massage Therapist, Black Belt Martial Artist, Transformational Author, Public Speaker and Spiritual Life Coach. Somehow, even as a child, I always knew I was here to help others. But I didnât know exactly what I was to do. For a long time Iâve been hiding quietly in the shadows. But all the while I was learning, growing, and studying with various Masters. But something has changedâ¦ Now I am ready to share my experiences and pearls of wisdom. I am excited to share my light and love with the entire world!Every week Sandra sends FREE Reiki healing energy to a group of people near and far. (Distance does not matter in the relay of energetic support.) She also offers courses, workshops, and events on a variety of topics, for more information please visit her website www.Recreate-yourself.com.",
