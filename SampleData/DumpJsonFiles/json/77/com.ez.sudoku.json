        "title": "Confusing",
        "comment": "Using help button should only solve the puzzle based on the updated annotations. The problem with the existing one is that although I have already edited the annotations to reduce possible candidates, when I press help me, calculations includes again  candidates I already removed from the annotations. It is confusing.",
