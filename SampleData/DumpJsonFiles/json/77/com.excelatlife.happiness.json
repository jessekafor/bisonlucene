The depth and breadth of information contained is better than in apps I have paid up to $5 for in the past.   The audio files, articles, and tests were so helpful to me.  Thank you for such a wonderful app, and thanks again for making it free :-)",

That alone gave me a chance to have the best experience possible as well as the ability to experience all of the many aspects of the app.  After a few weeks of using this app I am more focused, relaxed and happy.  I will continue to use it daily and will explore more that you offer.  Great job!",
