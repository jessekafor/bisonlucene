    "description": "Join us on a guided walk around the outside of the 100-year-old Middlesex Guildhall, today home of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. This Grade II* listed building is situated on Parliament Square in London, on a plot of land closely linked with justice and the law for nearly a millennium. The present building was completed in 1913, and is the third courthouse or Guildhall to be built on the site. The Guildhall was designed by Scottish architect James Gibson in an \"art-nouveau Gothic\" style, with intricate carvings and mouldings by Henry Fehr. This walking tour guides you around the building, pointing out some of the rich symbolism of Gibson and Fehr's allegorical figures and historic tableaux. Discover what the external features tell us about what went on inside, and continues to do so today, by downloading the app and taking this easy-to-use virtual tour of the home of the UK's highest court.",
