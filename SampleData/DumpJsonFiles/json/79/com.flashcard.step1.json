        "comment": "The  good: lots of cards covering all the major step 1 subject  areas The bad: very poor organization. App doesn\\'t remember where you left off. The only way to get back to the last card you viewed is to keep tapping the forward arrow, one card at a time. There are no card numbers either. The Pin feature needs work too. All pinned cards are grouped together regardless of category- you can\\'t choose to just view  your pinned anatomy cards, for example. They are simply displayed in the order you pinned them.",
