Youâll be challenged with hundreds of Alberta-based questions from every category in the Alberta Driverâs Handbook. - Perfect for anyone wanting to practice for their learner's licence exam - Take the practice exam as many times as you want in a safe, risk-free environment - Each exam is different (30 randomly selected questions each time), providing you with access to a variety of questions - New questions are added regularly This practice exam is for study purposes only. â¨The actual Alberta Class 7 Learnerâs Licence exam may differ from this practice exam in form and content. Visit http://www.ama.ab.ca for more information. NOTE: The exam works off-line (without a wifi or 3G connection) but a connection is required to review the online handbook.

I did use this as a fast study and brush up after reading the book but I also read the the book way more. Dont rely on just the questions to pass because it WONT work for you than.  Learn the book word for word and your set. This was great for having the book in it though! Definitely a 2in1 deal",
