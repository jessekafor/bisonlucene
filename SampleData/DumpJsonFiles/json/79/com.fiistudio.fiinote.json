He is always approachable & listens to what the users say. In today\\'s age this is a rarity & greatly appreciated!   FiiNote truly is the all-in-one app for note taking! If you are new to it I tell you invest some time to learn it before snap judging it. This  is not just an app; FiiNote is a Suite for handwritten or typed notes, drawing, and the UI makes sense!",

        "comment": "There\\'s a few great note taking apps but this one is by far my favorite because of its beautiful and easy to use handwriting feature.   I had been using Freenote for a few months and I loved it so much I had to try this one.   I  am a student and much of my studying relies on my ability to remember what I\\'m learning. I remember better while I\\'m writing versus typing. I had Freenote on an older tablet and when I went to buy a new one, I went with an Android system instead of iOS because this app really helped me through my classes. I look forward to having it available on iOS though.  I love Fiinote and I would recommend some updates like: option to automatically adding a space after writing a word like in Freenote and the ability to insert pics and have words wrap around it.  I found a way to write around my inserted pictures but uou have to export the file in the direction you wrote and aligned the image or else the words will cover up the picture. At least that\\' s what happens on my tablet.  The developer is awesome. He replies quickly to emails.  I don\\'t buy many apps but I\\'d support this one.",
