I was very impressed by the accuracy of the tracking, even the frequent update of the estimated arrival time without having to constantly hit some refresh button.  As a licensed private pilot, I was going to track her flight as it neared on the radio frequency app, however there was really no need for it.  I was at the baggage claim 5 to 10 minutes ahead of when she got off the flight and I already had her luggage.  This is a fantastic app.   The GUI on this app is also excellent.",

Still no update to program to make it compatible with custom rom ...

They advised making a change to some system files. I will try that and report my findings.",
