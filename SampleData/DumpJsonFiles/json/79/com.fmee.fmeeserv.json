And if you put a shortcut to the webpage on your home screen, it works very much the same - hit the icon and you get a Google map with the phone location on it.  Better in one way; you don\\'t have to fuss around with enabling it as you did with Latitude.",

        "comment": "Follow mee does almost exactly what it say  Good areas: Stealth mode works perfectly. Well hidden, hard to discover, and works like a system app. Accuracy is within 50-100 feet, and you can follow from phone, tablet, laptop, pc, or anything else.   Room for improvement: the only area that I was disappointed with was that the information was not always current, even after clicking update/ refresh. I was never sure if the program was malfunctioning or if it was the device.   All-in-all a good app. I give it..",

        "comment": "Have it for 48 hrs or so now. Works well. The MAP works well enough I find myself glued to the map for hours. Power drain is not a prob at all, even at 5 min update intervals. Most of our problems are to do with the phones not getting good GPS signals. Once I started the GPS Test app on my phone I\\'ve learned to put it close to an ext window and WOW most probs disappear. Only if apps still works in backgrd mode when phone in sleep mode. Still don\\'t know how to upgrade to Delux from Standard. I like the coded lines on the phone when its running, very informative. Panic button works well on Delux. Battery % readout is very cool too.",
