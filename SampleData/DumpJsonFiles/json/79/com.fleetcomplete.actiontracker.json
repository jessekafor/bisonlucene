    "description": "Fleet Completeâs Action Tracker HOS fully automates Hours of Service and Driverâs Vehicle Inspection activities, and replaces time-consuming manual paperwork with a tablet-based digital logbook. The application automatically logs driver hours and calculates driver availability, ensuring easier HOS compliance. Drivers can view their available hours, manage their duty status and complete vehicle inspection reports, all on their tablet. Switching to Action Tracker HOS will reduce the chance for logging errors, and save time previously spent recording, calculating, and managing driving availability via paper-based logs.  Action Tracker HOS uses GPS and engine data as key components in ensuring HOS accuracy and compliance. The application will connect wirelessly from the tablet to the Fleet Complete Fleet Tracker device (MGS100, MGS200 or MGS500) via Bluetooth. Once connected, the HOS application will automatically log activity on the tablet and transmit a copy to Fleet Complete. All current and historic log data will be available 24/7 for reporting and analysis via Fleet Complete. Action Tracker HOS is 100% compliant with all FMCSA and DOT requirements, and already supports upcoming US FMCSA July 2013 rule changes.
