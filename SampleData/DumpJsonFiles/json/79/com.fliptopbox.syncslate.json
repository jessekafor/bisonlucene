        "title": "Needs Frame Accurate Time Code",
        "comment": "NTSC (U.S.) video shoots at 30 frames/second. PAL (European) is 25 FPS, and film is 24 FPS. A timecode slate needs to be accurate to the exact frame of the format you are using. Thus your time in this beta version is accurate to the 1/10th of a second which does not match the frame rate of video or film formats. If you are even one or two frames off in editing the lips do not sync right. I suggest you make a user option to show time down to 24, 25 or 30 frames per second.",

Clap noise is almost inaudible compared to  proper board. Text is too small to read on certain focal lengths. Vertical only operation so if you have a nice nexus10, it\\'s wasted. There\\'s also a load of programming code on screen.  Disappointed with this poor app when the market potential for one that actually works is massive.",
