I have deposited over a dozen checks since last November and all deposits worked 1st time, every time. As far as those who want their user ID and passwords saved... are you crazy??  This is your bank account!  So you don\\'t care if someone gets a hold of your phone and they have access to you banking business?  Please, First Tech... DO NOT CHANGE THIS FEATURE!
