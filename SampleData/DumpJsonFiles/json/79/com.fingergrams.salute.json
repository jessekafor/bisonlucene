    "description": "An easy-to-use postcard/texting app. Create unique Fingergrams by wirting message and selecting one of our many quirky images. Hilarious silly alternative to giving someone the middle finger or saying FU.Itâs our hope that this will one day make people think of the goofiness associated with our products, and mute the negative energy that is so often associated with this gesture. 5% of the profits go towards a rotating series of charities. Hence, our slogan, âShow Them How You Really Feel!â Fingergrams are meant to be used in the following ways:   â¢\tAs a joke between friends   â¢\tAs a goofy fun way to blow off steam...and         according to research, may potentially improve           your health. Studies show that people who use humor         to deal with repressed feelings or find means to          express them are happier than those who repress         their emotions.     â¢\tAs a joke between Democrats and Republicans,         Libertarians, Independents, people who don't         vote or don't care   â¢\tBetween sports fans   â¢\tBetween students at different schools   â¢\tBetween students at the same school   â¢\tBetween citizens and their government   â¢\tAs a gentle reminder to those people who need to be         encouraged to do the right thing.  If you receive a Fingergram...remember itâs a joke OR a reminder to do good thingsâ¦and you can return the favor with a funny Fingergram of your own.Please Note: Fingergram is NOT an anonymous messaging app.  It is also a separate product from PolitiGrams - our poltical app.  This is a parody APP meant only to achieve the messaging above and on the www.fingergrams.com website. it is a great alternative to a traditonal FU.",
