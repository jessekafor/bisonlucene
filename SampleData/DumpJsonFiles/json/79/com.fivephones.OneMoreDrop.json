    "description": "He lives in the grass, sustained by pure water, and wants nothing more than to have a friend. Itâs Peekaboo, a tiny sprite with antennae and a large smiling mouth. Every hour of every day, he watches out for a new friend. Would you like to help him? Just guide a water droplet through a host of obstacles to the right place. Once the water drops close enough to the target, a new friend will grow. Peekaboo will be ecstatic, and the grassy meadow will be a happier place.The game is based on the laws of physics: the water droplet evaporates in contact with a hot obstacle, and steam rises up. It changes state again once it runs into a cold barrier, drops down or freezes, and so on.Description:Logical game using water in all states8x9 levels in the full versionPlayers may create their own game levelsBrowsing between levelsOriginal graphic designControl by tilt or touchSuitable for ages 5â99Online high scoresRecommended minimum resolution: 320x480.",
