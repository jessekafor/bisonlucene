        "comment": "Rather than hoping I check the taskbar notifications on time, it would be great to have widget that allowed scrolling of tasks and clicking to add to your counts.  Works as advertised, but having to open and click for each of many tasks that I track is a bit cumbersome and leads to me forgetting to do it. It would also be awesome to have web access to your account (so I can leave the webpage open during the workday and check off items there more conveniently).  Great app, but would be 5/5 with those changes.",
