    "description": "Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class C 219 Wallpapers and Backgrounds Application The first generation of the CLS, the Mercedes-Benz W219, was based upon the W219 platform, a W211 E-Class spin-off that is six inches (152 mm) longer. Many state that the CLS actually started as the 1999 Dodge Charger concept which the Germans promptly killed in its own tracks to production; so they could use the 4-door coupe design language themselves on a Mercedes branded vehicle. IVM Automotive, a subsidiary of German roof system specialist Edscha, developed the entire vehicle from the Vision concept to the production version. More than 150 IVM engineers were involved, making the CLS the largest vehicle development project in the company's history. Design patents were first filed on July 24, 2002This application contains high quality pictures, any of which you can install on your desktop of your phone or tablet, or save to your deviceYou can also set the time change the image and it will be constantly changing automatically to the next, and you do not have time to go into each app to do it. Every day - a new picture!This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
