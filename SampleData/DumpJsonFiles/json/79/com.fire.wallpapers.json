Letâs say few basic things we should know about it.It is a mixture of hot gases. Flames are the result of a chemical reaction, primarily between oxygen in air and a fuel, such as wood or propane. In addition to other products, the reaction produces carbon dioxide, steam, and heat. But it also produces light. From the time mankind started to evolve, it has been a source of comfort and protection. Even today with all our technology you can find us huddle around camp fires at cottages and camp-sites around the world. As far as this joy is concerned we should mention that beautiful feeling close to the fireplace-wonderful moments when we gather around in the cold winter days.It started out as protection, from the dark, the wild beasts and the unexplainable things in the world. Then we harnessed it for power. The power of it can be good, as when it is used to our advantage or bad as when it is wildfires.It often refers to the passion or lust but it also drive behind creativity, the desire to learn and the convictions of your beliefs.Download this wall papers and have fun! Give your screen a worm and powerful look!",
