    "description": "FREE FOR LIMITED TIME ONLY - DOWNLOAD TODAY Talking Gremlin is packed full of amazing & funny animations, all of which are FREE! He will repeat everything you say in his awesome voice and is guaranteed to be tons of fun for you, your friends and your family! Read his full story in the app :) Talking Gremlin features Fanthorp Icarus Parsec, but he prefers to be called Little Fip. In his own words, here's what Fip agrees to do when you download him to your Android device: â Repeat what you say, but in my awesome voice â Laugh when you tickle me - giggle! â Wave at you â Taunt you weak humans with my muscular strength â Take any physical abuse you throw at me - but I'm tough and WILL fight back! â Yawn right before your face if you ignore me â Cry when I get hurt - I'm tough but I have feelings too, you know? â Be forced to do something you may not like if you annoy me too much! Fip says that he is currently learning more emotions and reactions. If you continue to interact with him, he promises to update you with these in the near future! Feel free to broadcast your recordings of Fip (max 30s.) to the rest of the world via Youtube, Facebook and Email :) ââ Important ââ - If you would like more animations, please email us with suggestions or leave a review here with requests for new animations.",
