        "comment": "This game is so addictive but frustrating, every time I play after little time the game vibrates then returns to home screen. It doesnt even stay open. Not only that the home button is always in the way so it closes often because i accidently press it during game play. Too bad because this game would get a 5/5 if they would fix this for the galaxy s2. Please if you are reading this dev team please fix the issue. I also get a weird screwed up start screen before the menu when I first load the game.",
