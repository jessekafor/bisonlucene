        "comment": "Throughout playing both versions, I realized some items are missing from both versions vs. each other and I wish all items could be on both, AT LEAST Android anyway!!! Not to mention, I have completed everything and the game is starting to get boring making me think to uninstall it. Not to mention that the new mpoints page is set up wrong in my eyes and I hate it. I\\'m not happy about the \\\"random restart\\\" bug and I have the FASTEST MOBILE PROCESSOR EVER (NvidiaTegra4). The ads are also annoying, they pop up and never go away keeping you from playing by freezing everything but the ad. The graphics are worse on android than apple, why. Unhappy with the game, I\\'m ashamed.",

However the coins were never added to my bank. ?????",
