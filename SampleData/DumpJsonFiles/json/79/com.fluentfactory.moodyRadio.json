        "comment": "I am not a tekkie so I have no idea what the problem might be. But I listen to Moody radio as often as I can. When an app for the Android was released I was excited! So often I\\'d be listening to a program on the radio and I\\'d arrive at my destination and not be able to hear the end. I immediately loaded the app after I found that it was available. I listen to Moody while walking and while cutting the grass. But lately It has been so sporadic. It keeps cutting out and I miss much of the program I am listening to. This happens no matter what the signal strength 2 or 4 bars and even though I have 4G. I have the Motorola Atrix HD 4G which was a new model when I bought it less then a year ago.",
