    "description": "Zenscapes is a series of beautiful animated paintings inspired by classical Chinese, Japanese and Korean landscape art.Spring Lake depicts a serene mountain lake, set somewhere in ancient China during mid spring.  A fisherman paddles across the lake in his sampan, stopping to catch fish.  To the north, a junk glides peacefully along while mist drifts lazily across the mountains in the background.The full version features a variety of customization options, from painting in more mountains and mist to switching the scene between beautiful night, daytime, sunset, and dawn settings.  Reload the scene as many times as you want to rearrange how the landscape is painted, and make the scene your own!  Looks equally stunning on phones, tablets, and any device that supports live wallpapers in both portrait and landscape modes.  Please send us an email with a description and your phone model if you have any problems or questions.",
