    "description": "Jogging Tracker is an automatic stopwatch that users use to track their running. The app is simple - select the distance wait for the signal and run :) It will automatically track your running using GPS and stop exactly when you pass the selected distance. It is much more easy to use than other sports tracker apps. You can now store and analyze your training sessions on your device. No internet logging - it works just offline.Jogging Tracker will show the following data on the display, which makes it the best tracker for your runs:1. Time.2. Path.3. Distance between start and end point.4. Runner top speed5. Average speed6. Current speed7. Trace of the route8. Speed ChartJogging Tracker is using audio signals so you can prepare for the start, start exactly with the stopwatch and stop on the finish signal. We created the Jogging Tracker for the competitive persons who want to track their progress while running and as the app is great you should know that it is still in its initial state so we came with even more great features in future!Jogging Tracker has 12 predefined standard running distances you can choose from and a free running mode as well.500  meters running800  meters running1000 meters running1500 meters running2 km running3 km running5 km running10 km running1 mile running2 miles running3 miles running5 miles runningFree running - run your own distanceJogging Tracker is recording all your times and will show you a nice speed chart for the distance. You can preview the history at any time as it stays at your phone and you can also open and analyze it in Excel as it is recorded in CSV file. You can preview the history by tapping on Menu -> HistoryYou can switch the display units (km and miles are supported)The history is also saved as a csv file so you can copy it and preview it in Excel.It is much more simple than other sports trackers. There are no calories, weight loss  or friends! No WiFi needed. It is just about you, your running, your time, and your speed!Can be used also for walking, bicycle and even with a car as it is also a great speed meter ! it is a new epoch in running!If you have some cool ideas about Jogging Tracker you can write them here as a comments.
