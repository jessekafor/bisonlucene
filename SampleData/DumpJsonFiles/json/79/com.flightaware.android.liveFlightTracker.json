For example, if I enter manually June 14, 2013 on the phone, it gets recorded as 7/14/13.  Then when I reopen the date dialog, it populates as Oct 6, 2018 and the dials show Jan 01 1900.  Also, the application \\\"unexpectedly stops\\\" every time I touch the map in the My Aircraft window to zoom or pan the map. Used to be a pretty good app prior to this.",
