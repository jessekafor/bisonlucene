    "description": "100% green app, no advertising, no extra permissions needed, 100% free.This app is pretty simple but useful, it gives you a pure white light in full screen mode. You don't have to worry about accidentally touching something, cause only the real buttons can exit it.With your imagination, White Board can make many things easy. For example, you can use it as a reversal film viewer(it provides standard color temperature light), a soft light source(like reading light, the flash light is too sharp and uncomfortable), an indicator and many others. It's also an energy saver, you can get more longer battery life than use your camera flash light.If you want more colors, please search my another app \"Color Board\", it's also free.Keywords: backlight,back light, light, white, board, white board, soft, soft light, light source, full screen, free.",
