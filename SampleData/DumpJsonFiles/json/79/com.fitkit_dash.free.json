Studies have shown that nutrients such as potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber are crucial to fending off or fighting high blood pressure. You donât have to track each one, though. Just emphasize the foods youâve always been told to eat (fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy), while shunning those weâve grown to love (calorie- and fat-laden sweets and red meat). Top it all off by cutting back on salt, and voilÃ ! This diet is similar in style to other popular diets you may have heard of, such as the TLC diet, mediterranean diet, and the Mayo Clinic diet. Rigorous studies show DASH can lower blood pressure, which if too high can trigger heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. (In fact, the name DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertensionâhypertension being the medical term for high blood pressure.) Itâs also been shown to increase âgoodâ HDL cholesterol and decrease âbadâ LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, a fatty substance that in excess has been linked to heart disease. Overall, DASH reflects the medical communityâs widely accepted definition of a heart-healthy dietâit's heavy on fruits and vegetables and light on saturated fat, sugar, and salt.
