        "comment": "Pros: Does have a lot of questions! (3000 or so) - The answers so far have been accurate. - Very easy interface! - Won\\'t cost you an arm (or fingers, if you\\'re filthy rich.)   Cons: answers are not very detailed (I\\'m good with that, I use it just for review.) - Won\\'t do your laundry or dishes, lol.   Overall, I think this is the best value for money for flashcards app market for usmle!  - a very happy student :)",

        "title": "Some questions & answer out of place under Neuro",
        "comment": "Have only tried the neurology flash cards so far. Towards the end of the set, some questions & answers are out of place. For example, Card 233 asks: Ependymoma in children is commonly located in what ventricle? Ans: Schwannomas. The next card with a diff question has the ans: 4th ventricle. This goes on until card 265. Then it gets back in order, then it screws up again a little later. I wish they had a function where we could put Q\\'s and A\\'s in order ourselves, but it doesn\\'t have one. I don\\'t even know how many of the other subject cards are like this. Either we get an update of this software with the Qs and A\\'s in the correct order, or we continue using this app hoping that we already know which Q&A is a misplacement error and which isn\\'t.",
