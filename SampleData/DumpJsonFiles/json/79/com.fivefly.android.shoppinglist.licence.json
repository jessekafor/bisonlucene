The sync option is the greatest thing for us to know who has picked up what on the way home from work. I had to use the support email once the response time was 15 min on a Saturday I was hoping for maybe late Monday to get a generic canned email reply. Love this app!",

        "comment": "Went ahead and purchased the license version to support development since this is easily the best shopping list app I\\'ve been able to find. If you want to add extra info and specify every item on your list down to the last detail, this provides the bells and whistles to let you do so. At the same time though, if you just want a basic list or two, this app allows you to have it simple too. Great for getting the list down and going over frequently bought items later.",
