        "comment": "Still a neat app to fess with the count, but a refresh capability to keep it current would make me purchase the 99 cent version. Just sayin\\'. October 18, no update...uninstall... And for anyone who says it\\'s not based on the polls, what then is the original map based on? At least use a poll average as a benchmark. As for the polls being all over the map, not true. Like I said, a neat app for tracking. Just not something that gives you any update beyond pre-debate. Useless in that regard.",
