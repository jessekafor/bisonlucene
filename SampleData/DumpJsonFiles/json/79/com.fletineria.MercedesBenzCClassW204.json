    "description": "Mercedes-Benz C-Class W204 Wallpapers and Backgrounds Application In the summer of 2003, the development of the W204 C-Class involved the use of a \"digital prototype\", which put a 2.1 terabyte digital replica of the car through a 15 million mile road course. This is an industry first which allowed for crash testing and more, before a physical prototype was actually constructed. The design of W204 was selected in 2003 and German design patents were first filed on September 9, 2004, showcasing a W204 fiberglass design modelThis application contains high quality pictures, any of which you can install on your desktop of your phone or tablet, or save to your deviceYou can also set the time change the image and it will be constantly changing automatically to the next, and you do not have time to go into each app to do it. Every day - a new picture!This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
