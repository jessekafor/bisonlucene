    "description": "A floor is the walking surface of a room or vehicle. Floors vary from simple dirt in a cave to many-layered surfaces using modern technology. Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal, or any other material that can hold a person's weight.The levels of a building are often referred to as floors although a more proper term is storey.Floors typically consist of a sub floor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface. In modern buildings the sub-floor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in. Because floors meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict building codes in the first world.simply enter the width and depth of the room and the unit of measure, and the resulting floor area of the room will be calculated in several different units of measure,  useful if you are measuring the room in one unit but for example the floor tiles you want are measured in a different unit.",
