        "comment": "This seems like a great app. Really like the design and concept. Unfortunately I live in a major city area and likr all apps that require check in, GPS can be tricky in the city. So unfortunately I cant check into my gym to use the app. Its a real shame too cause I like the app. Is there any chance of adding a manual check in?",

Also kind of builds off GymPact\\'s idea which is designed better as you set the number of days you will go to the gym and then if you miss that # of days your money goes into a huge pot that is split by everyone that went to the gym their set number of days.",
