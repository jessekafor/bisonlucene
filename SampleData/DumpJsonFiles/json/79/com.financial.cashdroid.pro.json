        "comment": "Definately appreciate this app and its features, particularly since I just switched from an iPhone to a Galaxy S3 and was looking for something equivalent to the banking app I had on iPhone (was SVT Accounts). After trying several other apps the Cash Droid app fitted my needs, in particular the ability to filter your accounts view to show unreconciled items (which along with the fully featured scheduler means I can see what payments are still due to come out of my accounts and thus easily see how much money is really left in each account and which expenses are still to be paid). I would give this 5 stars if there were a couple of minor feature enhancements added: * Ability to record transfers of funds between accounts * When showing account balances include the current reconciled balance (perhaps in smaller font) along with the current total balance. * I was initially confused by the interim balance displayed in an unreconciled expense when that expense was entered on an earlier date, since it displayed the balance based on the entry order of the expenses (but it would be more useful to use the reconcile order instead of entry order)",
