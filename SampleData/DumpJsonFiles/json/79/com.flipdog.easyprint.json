(Very easy) Once that is done, it found all my printers in my house. I have a wired networked Dell laser printer on a gigabit network and a wireless Brother printer on a wireless \\'N\\' network. The printing is clear, dark and legible, no driver conflicts. Works seamlessly with Google Cloud Print. It can also send to my Google docs account. It found my 2 phones (HTC One S & LG G2X) I can send anything to my phones though this app. It will also send to Adobe PDF print. It was easy to setup, it did not ask any confusing questions. This is a great app. I would pay for this app. It has small ads that are not intrusive on a tablet screen. Since this is a free app, I click on the ads and have bought something to support the developer.",
