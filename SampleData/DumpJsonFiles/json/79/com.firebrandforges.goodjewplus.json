    "description": "Good Jew is great for anyone interested in learning a littlemore about Judaism and Jewish history and customs. We focus on breadth of knowledge, combining several app concepts into one neat package. There is a news feed to the Jerusalem Post, Haaretz, and the Forward, updating the reader on developments in Israel and the world, aWisdom section with Pirkei Avot and Kabbalah, a Prayer section with an overview of religious texts, common blessings with Hebrew and English text, an overview of the holidays with associated blessings, a dynamicfeed to weekly sermons (Parsha), and the Psalms of David.  We have a calendar section with a multi-year listing of Jewish holidays and the current date in the Hebrew calendar.  Thereâs a glossary with hundredsof Yiddish terms and definitions as well as biographies of 40+ individuals from Biblical, Middle-Ages, and Modern eras.  Hopefully, with a little knowledge distilled onto your mobile device, you'll be one or two taps away from being a Good Jew.",
