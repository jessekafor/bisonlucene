        "comment": "This is a great app... works off-line or on-line. I leave it on constantly and it\\'s amazing. I check it for accuracy, and find that it\\'s 95% accurate.  That\\'s not bad at all...  I would love to see more functionality, though. it would be great if the information can be uploaded to FB or something else. more graphs would be cool too... For example, having a line graph that compares days. Also, maybe having a field where one can enter weight, so that we can track.   These suggested functionality would make the app, wicked cool, but as is, it is a great app.  I highly recommend it.",
