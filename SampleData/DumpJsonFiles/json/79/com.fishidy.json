(ie change colors, highlight, animate).  Not sure if it is there but did not see any place to save a lake map for offline mode.  I would like to see canadian lakes added (that is where I need this the most).  Logterm things:  gps waypoints to add your own hotspots,  gps plotter to track where you have been like gps fish finders have.  Keep up the good work. I had to take a star away because it still does not let me login with my motorola xoom. At first it I had no login button and now after latest update I get server error.",
