I currently have 7 games that I\\'ve been waiting for my opponents to finish for weeks now. I\\'m spanking them all and they just let their end sit because they don\\'t want the loss. Bullshit. Own up. Words with friends gives you a loss if you stop playing so take a cue from them and update please. 5 stars when it happens.",
