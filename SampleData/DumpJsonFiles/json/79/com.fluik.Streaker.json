I beat my last score. Then what happens? My vision is blocked, i\\'m startled by words suddenly appearing in the middle of my screen, and i run into a bush! How about let me know at the end of that game that i hit a new high score? Also, can the female character have little things she says while she\\'s running? All the male characters do. Sexist much?",

It\\'s got a good since of humor, a nice variety of obstacles, nice looking cartoony graphics, gradually speeds up just enough to be challenging but not too fast as to make it frustrating, and runs very smoothly on my Nexus 7 tablet. Streaker Run is just one of those few great games that manages to get it right in every way, which is why it\\'s on my home screen with my other most used apps so I don\\'t have to go over to my games screen to open it because whenever I want to play a game 90% of the time I want to play Streaker; it\\'s just that good.",
