        "comment": "Fun game. Slightly boring and repetitive levels are offset by fun and unique bosses. The game is not 100% polished (there\\'s no indication that you\\'re doing any damage to bosses, for example) but still fun for what it is.  It\\'s a bit weird to have physics in a shmup, and it doesn\\'t really add much to the experience, but it\\'s no big deal.",
