It can be called \"cinema in silhouette\". Performers of the art are often called a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and also because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight and therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.Want to learn how to do by hand shapes of the shadows? Swing application, it assembled a large collection of shadow theater with their hands.The program includes a lot of animals (swan, cat, dog, wolf, pig, rabbit, bear, heron, kangaroo, eagle, elephant, snail, deer, goose, alligator, frog, and others) and silhouettes of people.Favorite images can be stored on a memory card. With this program, children can draw a lot of animals.Do you want to cheer up your kid?

If the thumb cap has been made of paper, it is possible to make rabbit ears from the scheme longer, and you have a donkey. You can play with children of different scenes, for example, a dog barks, a goat threatens her butt. The shadows are clear, the light should fall directly and not to the side, and the lamp should not be close, but in two or three meters away from the wall.1 Application is ad-supported(Airpush);2 Advertisements may be delivered by Airpush to the Consumerâs notification tray, home screen or within the Application3 Consumers may opt-out of Airpushâs delivery of notification tray or home screen advertisements by visiting www.airpush.com/optout, and may opt out of Airpushâs data collection by uninstalling the Application",
