Gluten is a protein found in wheat (including kamut and spelt), barley, rye, malts and triticale. It is used as a food additive in the form of a flavoring, stabilizing or thickening agent, often as \"dextrin\". A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that leads to wheat intolerance. Related conditions are dermatitis herpetiformis and more general forms of wheat allergy. While there is no treatment currently available for Celiac Disease, following a gluten-free diet can make this condition much more manageable.
