        "comment": "It\\'s good to be king. Especially when the kingdom you rule has access to an airship that can take you anywhere. However, it\\'s not as easy as it might sound; airships are difficult to control. They just travel in a straight line unless you plunk down a large fan to push them the way you want to go. That\\'s the idea behind Kings Can Fly Free, where you must carefully plan out the route you want the zeppelin to take, before letting things go live. There\\'s not much more to the game than that, and that\\'s fine; simplicity is good. However, I\\'d have liked more customization, and perhaps more real-time moving obstacles to plan around. Even without those, however, Kings Can Fly Free is well worth a look. Download it today and get planning. -- via Best Apps Market",
