Two points I\\'d like to raise: they should improve integration with weather in non-US locations (though it works well when I tell it to search by coordinates) and most of the sub-apps could do with a little more polish in the presentation.   But don\\'t think that any of that compromises the application as a whole; I am very pleased to have purchased this application, it provides an excellent service.",
