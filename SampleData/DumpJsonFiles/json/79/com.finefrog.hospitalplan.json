        "comment": "This could be a Fab app. However, in the section where the hospital details are to be filled in the app crashes. The user is asked to input the name of the hospital, which was fine. However, when entering the address of the hospital, the app appears to try and find street names as the name is typed, which slows it down considerably when you think on a global scale. Eventually, it causes the app to crash. I tried 8 times and was never able to get past the 4th letter of the street name. It also seems to default to locations in the US. I think the app should allow the user to place a marker on the map, which would be much easier than typing in an address, and may resolve the crashes.",
