    "description": "Our unique zoomable 'South-East-Asia' map atlas uses Google's online map service to generate custom real-time regional maps plus separate maps for each of the countries from Thailand in the north-west to Indonesia and the Philippines in the east.  Also included are separate maps for the very large metropolitan areas. You can easily switch between 'Road' or 'Hybrid' maps at a click, and zoom in (and out) to any detail level desired -- down to the house level!   Change to a different area of focus with the drag of a finger and your display is instantly updated.   And your Current Location is always highlighted by an animated blue dot, if you choose to allow the app to use your current location.Tapping a \"Facts\" Button, when shown, retrieves extensive relevant interactive descriptive information from Wikipedia.  By following indicated links, more facts and photos are available in your specific areas of interest.",
