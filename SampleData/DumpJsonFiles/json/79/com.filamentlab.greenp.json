    "description": "Easily uncover the locations of Green P carparks in Toronto With the only **official, Toronto Parking Authority, Green P App**, built specifically for Android. Search by current location, or by destination. Your search will plot all Green P carparks relevant to your location or destination. You can even filter your results based on price or distance. After youâve parked, set a smart timer based on the expiration time on your pay-and-display ticket minus walking time to your destination. You wonât have to do any math. The only work youâll have to do is in walking back to your car when the appâs notification sounds. The Green P carpark app helps you find parking on the fly and maximize every minute youâve paid for.The Toronto Parking Authority reminds you that using a handheld device while driving is illegal in Ontario and unsafe. Drivers are encouraged to pull over to the side of the road before using the app, or have a passenger do the navigating.----------Features List:* Search for carparks by Current Location (GPS)* Search for carparks by Destination* Sort results based on price or distance* Eliminate the guesswork from finding reliable lots* Get to your destination faster, with less driving* Set a parking timer that accounts for foot travel time from car to destination----------For app support, please email us mobile@greenp.com.",
