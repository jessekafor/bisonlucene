What a great concept by having a parent's section at the end of each of your stories to provide guidance with first encounters. A great introduction of Luca in this story an Iâll look forward to learning more about his character in books to come.\" â iTunes review, Luca Lashes: The Brown Eyed Boy with the Magic Eyelashes, 5 out of 5 stars, 5/4/12\"The books are very well put-together - the illustrations are adorable and I like that there are interactive features. I also love the bonus parent tips, since sometimes it can be hard to know what the best way to approach a child's fear is.\" â Bekah, Motherhood Moment, 5/8/12\"The story offers kids a way to overcome their fears on their own, which I think is great! And the app lets kids poke around with the characters and the objects. It's cute.  Also, other books in the series seem to target other common problem-areas. I look forward to more!\" â StaticFox, Amazon review, Luca Lashes: The Brown Eyed Boy with the Magic Eyelashes, 5 out of 5 stars, 5/3/12Luca Lashes is an innovative, fun, and exciting activity. It provides an incredible bonding experience for young families.â  â Scott A.
