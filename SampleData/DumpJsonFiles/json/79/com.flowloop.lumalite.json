I love diversity of colors but hate trying to find backgrounds that match the colors in mind. I would have to edit the background hues with a photo editing app. Now I don\\'t have to anymore! I definitely love it! No problems with lag but the battery tends to die a tad bit quicker but can be overlooked. It will help me be more responsible about keeping my phone charged. :)",
