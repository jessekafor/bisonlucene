        "comment": "I understand the intent was to keep the game simple in regard to not having to micro-manage a lot of things, but with this simplicity comes some flaws. The game was ok for a couple of hours but then I realized it\\'s weaknesses. You\\'re either going to win easily on a level or you will not based on what kind of adaptive mode the game is in. There doesn\\'t seem like much middle ground where you need to irk out a win by the skin of your teeth. I\\'m using the normal adaptive level and I notice certain times it\\'ll end up having ships out way faster than is possible (second town isn\\'t even managed yet so if the rate of gold growth is the same it\\'s impossible for it to have the number of ships out that it does.) So you lose the level and then it adapts and then it\\'s too simple.. it\\'s all a matter of who grabs the extra towns first..but the issue is there isn\\'t that much skill involved in doing so. Granted I\\'m only level 20 of the first set of maps so maybe it changes later? However, on level 20 I notice the impossible goofiness I just described above big time...it has way too many ships out too quickly. I\\'m sure the level will adapt in  gold growth rate, but the AI isn\\'t really adapting.",
