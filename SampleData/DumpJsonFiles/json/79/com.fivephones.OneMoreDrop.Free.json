    "description": "He lives in the grass, sustained by pure water, and wants nothing more than to have a friend. Itâs Peekaboo, a tiny sprite with antennae and a large smiling mouth. Every hour of every day, he watches out for a new friend. Would you like to help him? Just guide a water droplet through a host of obstacles to the right place. Once the water drops close enough to the target, a new friend will grow. Peekaboo will be ecstatic, and the grassy meadow will be a happier place.The game is based on the laws of physics: the water droplet evaporates in contact with a hot obstacle, and steam rises up. It changes state again once it runs into a cold barrier, drops down or freezes, and so on.Description:Logical game using water in all states3x9 levels in free version (8x9 levels in the full version)Players may create their own game levelsBrowsing between levelsOriginal graphic designControl by tilt or touchSuitable for ages 5â99Online high scoresRecommended minimum resolution: 320x480.This free version of One More Drop contains third party advertisements.",
