As well, do not rant about receiving free apps. That is not the goal here. That would be stealing in plain sight. Android is open source, most apps are not. Go to xda and educate yourself. If you do not see any apps, go to the main screen >> menu button >> settings >> refresh apps >> profit!!",

Could be useful to have all root apps in one place, but not with such a meagre collection, most of which root users already have as essentials!",
