    "description": "Get ready, get set, and get outdoors! A new genre of outdoor fitness apps for children where you are the character in the game. Itâs an interactive cartoon where running is how you play the game.PLEASE NOTE: The screen will go black while their is a run in progress.Directions:- Turn the volume to High on your Android phone.- Enter your name in the Profile settings.- Choose from 3 big cats, Lion, Leopard, or a Cheetah. - Choose from 3 different levels, Easy, Medium and Hard - âYouâre being chased by another Big Catâ. - Pick how far you want to race: 10 steps, 30 steps, 30 seconds, etc. or try the âFree Runâ mode. - Run with the smartphone (screen goes dark so you can't see it while your running)- Watch the video replay of your race and see how well you did against the computer cat. - Check out your high scores. Your progress is tracked via the Android's built-in accelerometer For safetyâs sake: - The screen will go dark during the run. Audible cues will be provided to start running and when the run is finished. - Find a large running area, preferably away from traffic. - Watch where you are running. - We recommend a heavy-duty case for your phone. You can use a forearm mount, a wrist mount, or just a rugged case to hold in your hand while you run. - The screen rotates frequently so one arm doesnât get stronger than the other.- Use a single earbud headset or Bluetooth headset to better hear the starting and ending announcements easily.Coming in October 2012- Password protected awards system for the parents. - Compete against other cats around the world. - GPS tracking to make sure that you arenât cheating. - Increase accelerometer precision.The Lite version has 20 minutes of play per day (instead of 2 hours) and 10 min of play per hour (instead of 30min per hour).Check out our website, or 'Like' us at facebook.com/genzplay for game updates and to give us some feedback as to some of the features you would like to see included next, or email us at fun@genzplay.com",
