        "comment": "Functional app that launched and ran smoothly on my Atrix 2. View transactions, make payments, view scheduled/recent payments all work.  Could use more features like statement download, the ability to see what the next minimum payment is, due date, and would love the ability to see/use rewards points.  Overall, I recommend to use if you have one of their cards and use online banking with them already.",
