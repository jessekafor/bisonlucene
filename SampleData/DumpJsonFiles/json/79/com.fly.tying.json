At the other end is the apparent view of A. K. Best, a well known professional fly tier and writer whose book, Production Fly Tying, suggests practical ways to streamline tying technique. Best emphasizes that fly tying is also a science rooted in careful observation of fish and their prey, and then designing and tying artificial flies to replicate that prey to catch fish. One of the first and foremost of these efforts was by Preston Jennings, in his classic: A Book of Trout Flies.Fly tying requires some basic equipment, the appropriate materials for the fly pattern being tied and a fly pattern to follow or replicate. Fly tying equipment enables the fly tier to efficiently and effectively assemble and secure the materials on the hook. Flying materials were originally limited to various furs, feathers, threads and hooks. Today there many different types of natural and synthetic materials used to tie flies. Fly patterns represent the ârecipeâ required to create the flyâwhat hook size(s) types to use, what materials are to be used, what colors, in what sequence and by what methods are they assembled on the hook. Hand-tied flies on the commercial market retail from less than a dollar to several dollars each. Fly tying is a challenging and rewarding hobby for some, a money-saving strategy for some fly fishermen, and a profitable commercial enterprise for the professional tier. Fly tying material can be anything that is used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns and furs, as well as feathers, hair and tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials not only include all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers but a wide array of synthetic materials.Mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, as well as elk and moose hair and chicken, turkey, and partridge feathers were and still are commonly incorporated into artificial flies.Flies have been named to honor or celebrate fellow anglers like Royal Wulff, Jock Scott, Quill Gordon and Adams. They are also named to describe their color and composition, such as Ginger Quill, Gold-ribbed Hare's Ear and Partridge and Orange. Some are named to reflect some regional origin, for example Bow River Bugger, Tellico nymph and San Juan worm. Others are named to reflect the prey they represent, like Golden stone, Blue-wing Olive, Pale Morning Dun and White swimming shrimp. NOTE: 90% of the videos will work perfectly on all devices, but 10% of the videos might not work properly on all devices!",
