Hardly anything in app/website is user friendly. It\\'s all confusing at first glance. Nothing is motivational nor appealing to keep using unlike IDOO with their Achievemint point reward system.",

        "comment": "I downloaded this app after seeing it used in a Verizon commercial. In said commercial it is presented as having workout videos you can follow along to. I\\'m not sure whose fault the misrepresentation is, but it is pretty bad. In reality the app is just a work out in text boxes, which is hard to follow when you\\'re doing something like yoga. You can\\'t get into any sort of flow if you have to stop and read text every pose. The \\\"videos\\\" are links to YouTube demos of the pose, and there is no way to link those videos into a workout to follow either. It\\'s really a horrible interface, not very useful, and certainly not worth $5.",
