Some video can not be played, perhaps its deleted by u-tube, but still a lot video from ice skating competition that u could watch here. Work pretty good, no problem so far. Why 4 star? Please, add more video, update the video with better graphics n delete the deleted video from the list. I like this app. Thank you. :)",
