Re-living real life AFL childhood fantasies and loving it.  Worth more than the price I paid.  Get on it.\"\"Great game and quite addictive, get around it.\"*****************Specky is the world's first game dedicated to taking huge grabs and here's some of the great features you'll get when you buy Specky.* Use opponents as a human step ladder! Soar over and on top of opponents to take a specky!* Fun Touch and Swipe gameplay designed specifically for your iPhone.* Realistic Physics see you fly through the air, crash through packs like a bowling ball through ten pins and plummet to the ground like a rock crunching opponents in your wake.* Increasing challenge by beating full backs and opponents who try to outmuscle and spoil you.* Unique experience every time you play.  Smart opponents and random variables mean that no two games will ever be the same.  * Get a Specky Score at the end of each level based on jump height, air time, pack ride and others.* Take Bigger Speckyâs by completing challenging in-game objectives to level up and jump higher!* Bite-Sized Gameplay designed to be played on the go for 1 minute or on your couch for hours.",
