        "comment": "This is a decent fitness app, it needs to be more streamlined in its data entry though. It needs to have the ability to copy sets in a workout instead of only adding a new set. An expansion of the exercise database is also needed, i.e. bodyweight exercises (spiderman pushups, inverted shoulder presses) and unconventional training methods(sledgehammers, macebells). There should also be an input for caloric expenditure as many track with HRMs, and daily food logs. Those additions would make this 5 stars.",
