The top 1/3 of the page is used up telling me how many lines, characters, sentences and words are in the note! who cares? Ironically you can also go find this info if you want to (under the \\\"More\\\" menu).  I would like the OPTION to have just my note/task with no other information eating up the screen. No date, nothing....just my note as if I wrote it on paper. 5 stars if I had that option.",

But with great programs comes great request. Is it possible that you guys can fix the issue where when you have a note with private privacy but does not ask for a password if you open the note from the note shortcut from the desktop.  Also can you add the feature of printing the note.  Other then that this app is up to par :-)",
