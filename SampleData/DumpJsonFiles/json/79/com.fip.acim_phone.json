    "description": "Also included is the audio OF THE HEADINGS ONLY of the lessons for you to listen to. NOTE: In order to access this audio you need to be connected to the Internet. All other functions do not require Internet access.This app allows students and readers of A Course in Miracles (âthe Courseâ) convenient access to the 365 daily lessons from its Workbook. To begin, simply select the lesson you are currently working on, then every time you access the app you will automatically be presented with the next lesson. If you want to repeat the previous lesson simply page back to it. A Table of Contents is provided which allows you to easily navigate around the Workbook. While the app contains the text of the complete Workbook for Students, it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system. The Courseâs teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God.Published in one volume, A Course in Miracles consists of three separate sections: Text, Workbook for Students and Manual for Teachers. The Text section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the Workbook exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within A Course in Miracles.A Course in Miracles was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. It was first published by the Foundation for Inner Peace in 1976.The Workbook for Students, contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: âThe exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.â You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day.",

ACIM is not about ritual so setting a rigid timeframe isn\\'t really what the WB lessons are teaching. I like these aids as tools that someday, I will put aside as toys.",

        "comment": "The navigate to lesson function required several attempts before working correctly.  It would also be very nice if the lesson recording actually played the ENTIRE reading for the lesson...VERY disappointed that it only played the title for the lesson.  I also agree with Julia that built in timers and reminders would be tremendously useful enhancements to this app.  Good start, but could use some additional basic features.",
