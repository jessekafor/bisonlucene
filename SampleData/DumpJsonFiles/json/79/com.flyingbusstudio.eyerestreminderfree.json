        "comment": "Hi, I am using this app to force my 7 year old to rest his eyes while using tablets, works fine initially. After a while, he figured out that he can get pass this by turning off the display and turn it on again during resting session. It will be good if resting session cannot be reset with that action.  Other than that, good app.  Motorola xoom",
