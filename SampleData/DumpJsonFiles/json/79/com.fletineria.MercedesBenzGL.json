    "description": "Mercedes-Benz GL-Class Wallpapers and Backgrounds Application The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a full-size luxury crossover SUV built by the German carmaker Mercedes-Benz since 2006. A three-row, 7-passenger vehicle, it slots above the Mercedes-Benz M-Class in the lineup and shares the same unibody architecture. The vast majority of GL-Class vehicles are assembled at Mercedes-Benz US International, Inc, in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama except for a small number of early production 2007 model vehicles which were manufactured in Germany.This application contains high quality pictures, any of which you can install on your desktop of your phone or tablet, or save to your deviceYou can also set the time change the image and it will be constantly changing automatically to the next, and you do not have time to go into each app to do it. Every day - a new picture!This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
