    "description": "The LOK-IT File Sync App is designed to simplify the process of transferring or copying files between a LOK-IT Secure Flash Drive and an Android device that is USB On-The-Go (OTG) compatible.For a list of these devices that we've compiled, please visit www.lok-it.net/usb-otg-compatible-phones-tabletsNote, Google Nexus tablets DO NOT support USB OTG for USB Storage devices so LOK-IT will not be accessible with the app.LOK-IT is the most secure portable data storage device in the world.  All contents are encrypted with 256-bit AES hardware encryption.  Authorization to LOK-IT is provided via an onboard PIN-pad and without the need for a software login.  Users simply enter a 7 to 15 digit PIN and connect to any USB compatible device utilizing any operating system, including Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, and even embedded systems on DVR, scanners, routers and medical devices.LOK-IT is FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Certified and can be used within US Federal government agencies.-If a full-size USB port is not available on your Android device, a USB OTG connector is required.-Android O/S 3.2 or higher.The LOK-IT File Sync app detects when a LOK-IT Secure Flash Drive is connected and the app will not recognize or connect to any other USB flash drives.
