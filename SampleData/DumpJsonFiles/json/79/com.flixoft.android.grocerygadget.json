        "comment": "I used this app for several years on my iPod touch, and when I got my HT Evo phone, it was one of the first things I put on it. It syncs with my iPad pretty well, but frequently the prices don\\'t get synced (they show up as zero on the target device). The UI is a bit clunky, but that\\'s pretty subjective. Periodically, it won\\'t let me edit any prices. All in all, it is only one-star app. The bar code scanning feature invariably returns the wrong product, so it\\'s useless. I emailed the author to ask a question... never got a reply.",
