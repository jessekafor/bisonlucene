        "comment": "*UPDATE* This app is wonderful.  I inquired about an option for creating playlists from song ratings and the developer responded in hours and had the update with this function in days.  There is nothing like it on the market and it is EASILY the best $1.05 I\\'ve ever spent on an app.  *(earlier review)The creator is very open to suggestions for improvement.",
