NOTE: If you are experiencing an issue where movies will not play, please confirm that you have a decent connection and signal strength before posting a negative review.

More information can be found at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/. If you have any questions or concerns related to the use of a particular film, then please contact us at support@flingsoft.com. We would be happy to help.NOTE ON MOVIE QUALITYMany people have commented on the quality of the movies, so please keep in mind these are not DVD quality films. First, many of these films never found their way to digital, so what you are seeing is actual first cut from film, tape, or other. Next, they are being streamed from the server so we are limited in the quality we can provide. We are doing our best to improve, but many of these films are rare which is why we feel this app is so special.FEEDBACKWe would love to hear your feedback on the app, so please tell us what features you would like to see added. Also, let us know if you have found great movies out in the wild that you think we should add to the collection.Follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/flingsoftguys",
