    "description": "Admit it: Most of us spend our days being sedentary. And we are slouching at the office for hours.No wonder that 80% of Americans will get at least one back pain incident.But except for back pain, there is also this feeling of our energy leaving us. We come to work energized, but we go home feeling drained.You know that sitting right and that moving throughout the day helps, yet no matter how many times you have tried, you always end up neglecting to take those stairs, walk around the building, or even just get up and stretch.You feel guilty for neglecting your own well-being, yet you don't know what to do to change that.Don't worry. The Office Exercise & Stretch can help.Just pick a stretch or exercise, set a reminder (e.g., Monday and Tuesday at 2pm), and you are done.Your phone will make sure you get up from that chair and move!And you will feel invigorated. Your back will thank you. Your legs will feel less stiff. And your focus on your work will increase. Don't be surprised if you improve your job performance!Ahh..the benefits of movement you see are almost unlimited!With the office exercise & stretch you can choose between 30 exercises and stretches and 5 \"workout\" sequences. You can set up multiple reminders that match your schedule and needs.Come on...it's time to get up from that chair!",
