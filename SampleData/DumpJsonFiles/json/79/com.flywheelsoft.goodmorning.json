    "description": "Good Morning is more than a talking alarm clock; it's a personal wake-up assistant. It can play a song and read the time, date, weather forecast, calendar entries, today's news, and a custom message of your choice.  And for hard-to-wake types, it can force you to solve a math problem to turn of the alarm.New voices are available for purchase in-app through SVOX.Multiple alarms and calendar reading available with pro key!  Access multiple alarms by hitting \"menu\" on the main screen.Something broken? Email me, I'll help!",

It never played a song to wake me up though, even though that choice was selected. It\\'s been an adventure every morning to see what it will say. This morning however, it woke me by telling the time, didn\\'t tell the weather, and I dismissed it. A full minute later, it started playing the alarm song with no way to dismiss it. I had to kill the process somehow.",
