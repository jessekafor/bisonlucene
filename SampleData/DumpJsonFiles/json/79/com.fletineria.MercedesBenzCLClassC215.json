It is based on the 1999â2006 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, though it rides on an 8-inch (203 mm) shorter wheelbase. The CL's front fascia of four oval headlights is shared with the W210 and W211 E-Class. The CL is offered as four models: the V8-powered CL 500, the supercharged V8-powered CL 55 AMG, the V12-powered CL 600, a limited-edition V12-powered CL 63 AMG, and the rare bi-turbo V12-powered CL 65 AMG. All models seat four.This application contains high quality pictures, any of which you can install on your desktop of your phone or tablet, or save to your deviceYou can also set the time change the image and it will be constantly changing automatically to the next, and you do not have time to go into each app to do it.
