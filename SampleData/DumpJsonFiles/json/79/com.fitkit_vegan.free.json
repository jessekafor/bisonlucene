How does the Vegan Diet work? While vegetarians eliminate meat, fish, and poultry, vegans take it a step further, excluding all animal productsâeven dairy and eggs. (Vegans are often animal rights activists who donât believe in using animal products for any purpose.) So say goodbye to refried beans with lard, margarine made with whey, and anything with gelatin, which comes from animal bones and hooves, too. Fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, tofu, soy, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes will be your staples. Will you lose weight? Likely. Research shows vegans tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less, and have a lower body mass index (a measure of body fat) than their meat-eating counterparts. If youâre doing it rightâi.e., eating lots of fruits, veggies, and whole grainsâyouâll likely feel full on fewer calories than youâre allowed each day. With that âcalorie deficitâ and a little physical activity, youâre bound to shed pounds. How quickly and whether you keep them off is up to you. Features â Elegant and intuitive interface â Over a dozen Vegan Diet recipes â Includes pertinent nutrition information for each recipe â Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack â Star your favorites for easy reference â Filter menu to sort â Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe Download the Vegan Diet app and start feeling healthier today! ------- Disclaimer: The Vegan Diet app is only intended to provide general information, without independent verification of the accuracy of the information provided to it, and the information is specifically not intended to be a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment by your physician or other health care professional.
