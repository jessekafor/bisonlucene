        "comment": "Great way to spend time while waiting for a doctor\\'s appointment or when you have a coffee break at work. The game is challenging enough to give your brain that 15 minute a day exercise - something that makes this game stand out comparing to many other games that are available these days. The shapes are fun everyday objects, but it took me some time to figure out some of them. My next challenge is to at attempt the \\\"hard\\\" difficulty level, which looks quite interesting with those half lines.",

        "comment": "Highly recommended, easy and casual but highly addictive :) I am writing this after buying the full version, the game was so much fun I just had to get the paid version with more levels. Excellent time killer, now every time I am bored I just take my phone out of my pocket and \\\"rotate the shapes\\\" :) I like that you can play it with one hand, that is something that is impossible to do with many games today. \\\"Hard\\\" difficulty level is a bit challenging, but I think I finally got it.",
