        "comment": "James at my local Cricket Authorized Store in Lakewood, Colorado flashed my Sprint HTC Evo 4g for me.  He did a great job, but we just couldn\\'t get any third party voicemail app to load properly to be able to restore the voicemail notification icon.  Finally we loaded Voicemail Notifier.  It took about 90 seconds to install, it set itself up on the phone unmanaged and began to work immediately.  I now have the original voicemail function restored to my flashed phone.  Icon pops up, swipe the notification bar, tap the notification message and it takes you right into your voicemail.  Awesome app and great service from James at Cricket in Lakewood, CO!",
