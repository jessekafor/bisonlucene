    "description": "Update 1.4 of Shift includes multitouch, overall improved game controls and ability to download to your SD card.Shift is an adventure puzzle platformer with a literal twist to the game play mechanic. You are subject 32763, trapped in an experiment. Can you find your way out? Antony Lavelle at Armor Games originally designed Shift for the desktop web. Since then it's been played by more than 10-million people. Due to popular demand, It was then released on the other touch screen devices, and over 1 million users have downloaded the game. Now, Shift is finally available for Android!Shift is based on the negative-space centric platform concept in a style elegant, yet minimalistic, and pulsating with spy music. Use the [arrows] to navigate your man of mystery along the levels and to jump. After a couple of warm-up levels, you'll need to master the art of Shift. Shifting flips you beneath the floor on which you are standing, and reverses both your body color and gravity. It's up to you to spot the paths that are available using this mechanism, and to figure out how to make it to the exit for each level. Hindering â or occasionally helping â your progress are impassable platforms, which can be rotated out of the way by collecting the proper key.Key features:1.\tSimple, but addictive gameplay2.\tSounds and music options3.\tUsers can SHARE scores via Twitter4.\t15 levels of varying difficulty5.\tAvailable in English, Spanish, and FrenchUpgrade to the full version of Shift for additional features like:â¢\tMore than 50 levelsâ¢\tCustomized soundtrack â¢\tUnique control mechanicsâ¢\tAds-freeFollow @Handmark on Twitter for updates or visit www.handmark.com/games/shiftApplication developed in partnership with Fishing Cactus.REVIEWS:\"Shift for Android is the new Angry Birds....plenty fun and seriously addictive.\" - Recombu.com\"â¦just the sort of brain tickler we like.\"-PocketGamer.co.uk\"â¦this game is shaping up to become my next Android gaming addiction.\" -Android and Me\"Itâs a great game that will get you eye-boggled.
