    "description": "Mercedes-Benz C-Class W203 Wallpapers and Backgrounds Application In 1994, development began on the next C-Class. Design work commenced in mid-1994, with the final design being approved in December 1995 by the executive board. Design patents were filed on April 20, 1998 and March 4, 1999.Testing was conducted throughout the late 1990s, with development concluding in late 1999. The second generation C-Class was introduced in March 2000. The sedan debuted with a range of inline-four and V6 petrol engines and inline-four and -five diesels. Most of the engines were carried over from the W202, but the C 320 was exclusive, offering 160 kW (218 PS)This application contains high quality pictures, any of which you can install on your desktop of your phone or tablet, or save to your deviceYou can also set the time change the image and it will be constantly changing automatically to the next, and you do not have time to go into each app to do it. Every day - a new picture!This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
