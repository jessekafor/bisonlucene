Based on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan. The diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization. The attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2â7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods. The cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. The consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan. Finally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight. â Features an elegant and intuitive interface â Over 50 dukan food recipes â Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack â Star your favorites for easy reference â Filter menu to sort â Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe Download Dukan Diet Free and start feeling healthier today!",

        "comment": "There are quite a few recipes that break the rules of the attack phase.  One that struck me was oat bran muffins, which are carbs.  There is a reason you only eat 1.5 tablespoons and not 8 per muffin, which is labelled as an eat all you want.    That, and only attack phase works, everything else is unaccessible or missing.",
