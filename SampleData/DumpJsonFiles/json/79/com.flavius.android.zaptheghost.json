    "description": "Zap The Ghost is a free (ad-supported) game which requires the user to tap various characters that appear on the screen.How to playThe purpose of the game consists of gaining as many points as you can before you run out of lives.You gain points by tapping various characters that appear, from time to time in the windows of a haunted house.Some of the characters are bad (ghosts, vampires, skull, pumpkin etc) so you will be rewarded points if you tap them but will lose one life if you fail to tap them.Other characters are good (boy, girl, panda, frog etc) so you will lose points and one life if you tap them.DifficultyThis game has two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.ScoresOnce you run out of lives the number of points that you managed to gather is your highscore. If high enough, this score will be saved locally on the device as well as globally using Swarm.Swarm is a highscore provider which makes your scores available over the internet and allows you to compete with other people playing the game in leaderboards.There are two leaderboards currently, one for Easy Difficulty and the other for Hard Diffculty.Permissions:1. INTERNET - Needed to access and submit scores to Swarm, access Credits links and send optional Crash Reports.2. READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows Swarm to prevent fraud and create a secure environment (no personally identifiable information is used).3. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows Swarm to detect when a user is online or when the user's connection has been lost.4. READ_LOGS - Allows debug logs to be collected and set along with optional Crash Reports. Note that you will be prompted when a Crash Report occurs and you can decide whether you want to send it or not.5. WAKE_LOCK - Prevents the phone from going to sleep (locking) while playing the game.Credits:This game was designed and developed by Flavius Ivasca.
