You are limited to only three personal blacklist entries, a one time update of the Community Blacklist (which is still massive and an awesome feature for free!) and the scheduling feature is not available.  ** The free 14 day TRIAL offer of Call Control Pro is optional and will revert to the free LITE version upon completion.",
