Projected arrival by airline (and airport, and other flight-tracking apps & web sites) is now 22:46 but FlightView says 20:40. The \\\"upstream\\\" data source for FlightView is unreliable and inaccurate. Map doesn\\'t work on this flight, showing only a partially-drawn white line from around PA heading westward off the left edge of the screen.  Earlier flights connecting into London show first (DY 161 TRD-BGO) as cancelled and the second (DY 1314 BGO-LGW) as \\\"no recent info\\\" (but if you click for details on that flight it also says \\\"cancelled\\\"). In fact both flights departed and arrived successfully, but also early. Again, other flight-tracking apps and web sites got this information correctly.  Other apps provide more reliable, accurate information. Disappointing performance from a company promoting itself as \\\"the leaders in real-time flight information\\\".",
