But be carefull: fishes bigger than you will eat you!Play levels in campaign mode and try to get the full three stars score in all 40 levels. You can also play single games with the difficulty you want: fishes chasing you will be hard though!Multiplayer mode is coming up. You will be able to play with friends via bluetooth or the internet.Please rate the game if you like it!",
