    "description": "Camera FV-5 is a professional camera application for mobile devices, that puts DSLR-like manual controls in your fingertips. Tailored to enthusiast and professional photographers, with this camera application you can capture the best raw photographs so that you can post-process them later and get stunning results. The only limit is your imagination and creativity!Major features:â All photographic parameters are adjustable and always at hand: exposure compensation, ISO, light metering mode, focus mode, white balance and program mode.â DSLR-like viewfinder display: see exposure time, aperture and stops display with EV and bracketing settings.â Full fledged exposure bracketing: from 3 to 7 frames, unlimited stops spacing, plus custom EV shifting.â Built-in intervalometer: make stunning timelapses (even bracketed/HDR timelapses) and time-controlled picture series.â Program and Speed-priority modes.â Long exposure support: take beautiful night photos and light trails with long exposure times up to 30 seconds*.â JPEG as well as PNG** image formats for lossless photo capturing, perfect for post-processing.â All camera functions assignable to volume keys. You can adjust EV, ISO, color temperature and more using volume keys. Devices with hardware camera shutter key are also supported.â EXIF and XMP sidecar metadata support.â Self timer for delayed shooting.â Autofocus, macro, touch-to-focus*** and infinity focus modes, plus a focus lock switch (AF-L).â Autoexposure (AE-L) and auto white balance (AWB-L) locks in Android 4.0+.â In background photo developing and processing allows a smooth, uninterrupted camera operation.â Digital zoom using multitouch pinch gesture. Also shows 35mm equivalent focal length!â The most advanced electronic viewfinder: live RGB histogram, 10 composition grid overlays and 9 crop guides available.â Powerful organization options: different storage locations and fully customizable file names (even with variables).â The user interface is available in more than 25 languages.This camera application completely avoids scene modes, instead you get full manual control over all photographic parameters, just like you do with a reflex camera, so you can ultimately control every aspect of the picture, and leave the post-processing to the computer. So after your DSLR, you will never miss a photo opportunity again, being able to capture it with the closer sensation to your DSLR as possible.IMPORTANT: If you find a bug using the application, PLEASE, visit the web page http://www.camerafv5.com or write to camerafv5@flavionet.com with your phone model name and the description of the problem, before writing a negative comment (developers cannot reply to Google Play comments). Customer satisfaction is my priority, and I will do my best to fix the issues as soon as possible!Connect with Camera FV-5 and stay always up to the latest information about current and future development. Visit the official website http://www.camerafv5.com, be a fan of http://www.facebook.com/CameraFV5, subscribe to http://www.twitter.com/CameraFV5 or watch tutorials at http://www.youtube.com/user/camerafv5.* Long exposures lowers picture resolution to 2 or 1 MP, depending models. The reason is explained here: http://www.camerafv5.com/faq.php#long-exposure-resolution** Lossless PNG saving is a memory intensive operation. Some devices might need to raise the memory limit for Camera FV-5 to save PNG pictures. See the FAQ here: http://www.camerafv5.com/faq.php#png-memory*** Touch-to-focus available for Android 4.0+ devices. Under Android 2.x, available only on Motorola, HTC and Nvidia camera drivers, plus some Samsung drivers and other phones.Permissions explained:- Approximate location and precise location: only used for geotagging functionality (disabled by default, and requires manual GPS activation).- Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage and take pictures and videos: required for the usual camera operation.",

Real exposure and focus control combined with the ability to save in the virtually lossless .png format turns an adequate phone camera into a piece of equipment that will produce gallery quality results. If images mean more to you than the usual weekend snapshots, get this app, apply your brain and eye and a little patience, and make something you can really be proud of.",
