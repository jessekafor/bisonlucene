        "comment": "I have used the desktop version of this, albeit an older version, and was pleased to see this development. But its functionality is too limted. I tried some of my own softwear that works on a real spectrum and it wouldnt load.  I had created successfull software for the spectrum back then. I think this app has posiblities,  however there can also be improvments. I dont mind the adds but the constant nags to pay for it is a problem. I will wait and try again at a later time. Uninstalled.",

        "comment": "\\\"You get what you pay for\\\" is a bit of a tired mantra these days, it seems. Two other Speccy emulators, Marvin and the USP, are infinitely better than this. Both are completely free. Yes, this is also free; but this doesn\\'t work fully. It\\'s merely an advert for a version that supposedly does work, a version that would struggle to match Marvin and USP even if it does. Unimpressed.",
