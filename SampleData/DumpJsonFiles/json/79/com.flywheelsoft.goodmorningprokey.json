At times it does talk but can\\'t snooze it just doesn\\'t turn off the talking until I turn off alarm completely. Other times it works well on first snooze but second time only white screen comes up no sound. Not sure if is Samsung problem or android 4.. Would love it if the developers fix it.",

The wake up assistant will read a personal note, your Google (or other) calendar, read an RSS feed, play an alarm, or play one of your favorite songs / tracks that you have stored on your device. Do not miss out on the best alarm clock I have tried to date!",
