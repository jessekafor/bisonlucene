Low carb diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption usually for weight control. Foods high in digestible carbohydrates (e.g. bread, pasta) are limited or replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of proteins and fats (e.g. meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, nuts, seeds and peanuts) and other foods low in carbohydrates (e.g. most salad vegetables). The amount of carbohydrates allowed in different low-carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins and South Beach diet, vary but they all share a common goal to help users lose weight by burning fat and restricting calories. As with the Paleolithic diet, several advocates of low-carbohydrate diets have argued that they are closer to the ancestral diet of humans before the invention of agriculture, and therefore that humans are genetically adapted to nutrition diets low in carbohydrates. In addition - low carb diets are often recommended to those with diabetes as a way to manage blood glucose. â Features an elegant and intuitive interface â Over 12 low carb food recipes â Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack â Star your favorites for easy reference â Filter menu to sort â Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe Download the Low Carb Diet Free app and start losing weight today!
